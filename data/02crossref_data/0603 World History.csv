The combination of fast and stringent NPIs reduced peak mortality by 50 percent and cumulative excess mortality by 24 to 34 percent. However, while the pandemic itself was associated with short-run economic disruptions, we find that these disruptions were similar across cities with strict and lenient NPIs. NPIs also did not worsen medium-run economic outcomes. Our findings indicate that NPIs can reduce disease transmission without further depressing economic activity, a finding also reflected in discussions in contemporary newspapers.","[{""name"": ""Sergio Correia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephan Luck"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emil Verner"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Mathematics']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Modeling and Simulation']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)]]"

Starting from the premise that nationalism is a global and ubiquitous idea in the contemporary world, it explores whether exclusionary tendencies have been reinforced by the pandemic. The pandemic and government responses will not necessarily trigger the increase in exclusionary nationalism that both far-right politicians and observers have noted. However, there are 4 aspects, examined in the article, that might be shaped by the pandemic. These include the recent trajectory of nationalism and its social relevance prior to the pandemic,the rise of authoritarianism as governments suspend or reduce democratic freedoms and civil liberties, the rise of biases against some groups associated with the pandemic, the rise of borders and deglobalization, and the politics of fear. Thus, while the rise of exclusionary nationalism might not be the inevitable consequence of the pandemic, it risks reinforcing preexisting nationalist dynamics.","[{""name"": ""Florian Bieber"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/17449057.2018.1532635"", ""10.1080/17449057.2018.1532633"", ""10.5539/res.v9n1p158"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2008.00325.x"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12325"", ""10.1177/0022343311425693"", ""10.5040/9781350098558"", ""10.1525/9780520342057"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12072"", ""10.1080/09557570008400339"", ""10.4324/9780203806210"", ""10.1017/S0043887100020852"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2018.304328"", ""10.1017/9781108589451"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02328""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Segmentation is valuable for two significant clinical applications, namely lesion detection and classification, providing means to improve accuracy and robustness. The manual segmentation of polyps in colonoscopy images is time-consuming. As a result, the use of deep learning (DL) for automation of polyp segmentation has become important. However, DL-based solutions can be vulnerable to overfitting and the resulting inability to generalise to images captured by different colonoscopes. Recent transformer-based architectures for semantic segmentation both achieve higher performance and generalise better than alternatives, however typically predict a segmentation map of $$\frac{h}{4}\times \frac{w}{4}$$ spatial dimensions for a $$h\times w$$ input image. To this end, we propose a new architecture for full-size segmentation which leverages the strengths of a transformer in extracting the most important features for segmentation in a primary branch, while compensating for its limitations in full-size prediction with a secondary fully convolutional branch. The resulting features from both branches are then fused for final prediction of a $$h\times w$$ segmentation map. We demonstrate our method’s state-of-the-art performance with respect to the mDice, mIoU, mPrecision, and mRecall metrics, on both the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB dataset benchmarks. Additionally, we train the model on each of these datasets and evaluate on the other to demonstrate its superior generalisation performance.Code available: https://github.com/CVML-UCLan/FCBFormer.","[{""name"": ""Edward Sanderson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bogdan J.

To structure the discussion, the contributors respond to three questions: (1) how should we understand the relationship between nationalism and COVID‐19; (2) will COVID‐19 fuel ethnic and nationalist conflict; and (3) will COVID‐19 reinforce or erode the nation‐state in the long run? The contributors formulated their responses to these questions near to the outset of the pandemic, amid intense uncertainty. This made it acutely difficult, if not impossible, to make predictions.

10.1108/HESWBL-10-2019-0148,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,Employability skills for 21st-century STEM students: the employers' perspective,"PurposeOne of the goals of educational institutions is to prepare their graduates to be workplace-ready. The purpose of this paper is to identify the employability skills lacking in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) industry from employers' perspectives to assist STEM educational institutions in creating more relevant programs inclusive of employability skills.Design/methodology/approachThis study addresses 16 job-specific skills based on data deriving from the responses of 250 Human Resource Managers (HRMs) who represent five manufacturing industries (Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Consumer Products, Electronics and Industrial Manufacturing) located in five regions (Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, West-Mountain and Pacific) of the United States.FindingsThe median scores for all 16 skills confirmed their importance for employability in the five manufacturing industries. The five highest ranking skills were team player, self-motivation, verbal communication, problem-solving and being proactive, which align with previous studies on workplace skills.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper is a call to all STEM educational institution stakeholders, both internal and external, to re-assess current curriculum and programs and collaborate to narrow the gap between graduate competencies and the practical needs of the workplace.Originality/valueThis paper attempts to bridge the gap between the competencies gained in STEM educational institutions and the competencies needed for the future workplace, as confirmed by HRM professionals. Although this study is focused on STEM educational institutions in the United States, it will be of interest to all STEM educational institutions worldwide who play a significant role in preparing the next generation of employees for the global workplace.","[{""name"": ""Doreen McGunagle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Zizka"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/152342231/8814546"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.04.261"", ""10.1177/10805699/244/360"", ""10.1080/23752696.2018.1462094"", ""10.1080/03075079.2017.1294152"", ""10.1108/00400910710754435"", ""10.1080/10668926.2011.567143"", ""10.13140/RG/2/2/16805/35044"", ""10.1080/1356251032000052294"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2013.09.316"", ""10.1007/s10956-019-09778-8"", ""10.1109/TALE.2018.8615414"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-02-2018-0016"", ""10.3794/ijme.82.267"", ""10.26634/jmgt.10.3.3783"", ""10.15394/jaaer.2018.1738"", ""10.1080/0042098042000316100"", ""10.21153/jtlge2015vol6no1art576"", ""10.1016/j.spbspro.2015.08.139"", ""10.1007/s10956-018-9735-3"", ""10.5032/jae.2018.01297"", ""10.1111/j.1465-3435.2004.00194.x"", ""10.1111/eject.12155""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"

A good classification not only gives generally accepted and understandable names to similar rocks but also links the bulk chemical composition to the stoichiometry of the constituent minerals and, potentially, also to the likely source, magmatic evolution and tectonic setting. The ‘ideal’ granitoid classification should be based on chemical criteria amenable to an objective treatment. Statistical analysis helps to identify the most discriminant variables. The key properties are (1) acidity/maficity, (2) alkalinity (balance of Na + K v. Ca), (3) aluminosity (balance of Al v. Ca, Na and K), (4) Fe/Mg balance and (5) Na/K balance and K contents at the given SiO 2 level. These are used by successful classifications, e.g. the I/S dichotomy is based mainly on aluminosity, while the Frost et al. (2001; ‘A geochemical classification for granitic rocks', Journal of Petrology , 42 , 2033–2048, https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/42.11.2033 ) classification includes all but Na/K. Even though it is commonplace to use weight percentages of oxides, we suggest that a better strategy is to employ simple atomic parameters (e.g. millications-based) that can be directly linked to modal proportions and compositions/crystal structure of individual rock-forming minerals. This facilitates a petrological interpretation, which, in turn, can be related to petrogenesis and, ultimately, to likely tectonic setting(s).","[{""name"": ""Bernard Bonin"", ""affiliation"": [""UMR

The sequence of S- to I- to A-type granite is repeated at least three times. All the granites are syn-extensional, formed in a dominantly back-arc setting behind a single, stepwise-retreating arc system between 530 and 230 Ma. Peralkaline granites are rare. Systematic S–I–A progressions indicate the progressive dilution of an old crustal component as magmatism evolved from arc (S-type) to proximal back-arc (I-type) to distal back-arc (A-type) magmatism. The alkaline and peralkaline A-type Younger granites of Nigeria were generally hotter and drier than the Lachlan A-type granites and were emplaced into an anhydrous Precambrian basement during intermittent intracontinental rifting. This geodynamic environment contrasts with the distal back-arc setting of the Lachlan A-type granites, where magmatism migrated rapidly across the orogen. Tectonic discrimination diagrams are inappropriate for the Lachlan granites, placing them in the wrong settings. Only the peralkaline Narraburra suite of the Lachlan Orogen fits the genuine ‘within-plate’ setting of the Nigerian A-type granites. Such discrimination diagrams require re-evaluation in the light of an improved modern understanding of tectonic processes, particularly the role of extensional tectonism and its geodynamic drivers.","[{""name"": ""William J.

We re-examine the prevailing model inferred from this classification that magma-rich margins have excess decompression melting at lithospheric breakup compared with steady-state seafloor spreading, while magma-poor margins have inhibited melting. We investigate the magmatic budget related to lithospheric breakup along two high-resolution long-offset deep reflection seismic profiles across the SE Indian (magma-poor) and Uruguayan (magma-rich) rifted margins. Resolving the magmatic budget is difficult and several interpretations can explain our seismic observations, implying different mechanisms to achieve lithospheric breakup and melt production for each archetype. We show that the Uruguayan and other magma-rich margins may indeed involve excess decompression melting compared with steady-state seafloor spreading but could also be explained by a gradual increase with an early onset relative to crustal breakup. A late onset of decompression melting relative to crustal breakup enables mantle exhumation characteristic of magma-poor margin archetypes (e.g. SE India). Despite different volumes of magmatism, the mechanisms suggested at lithospheric breakup are comparable between both archetypes. Considerations on the timing of decompression melting onset relative to crustal thinning may be more important than the magmatic budget to understand the evolution and variability of rifted margins.","[{""name"": ""Julie Tugend"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg, CNRS-UMR 7516, Université de Strasbourg, 1 rue Blessig, F-67084 Strasbourg Cedex, France"",

10.1093/ahr/rhaa511,AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,The Four Black Deaths,"Abstract The Black Death, often called the largest pandemic in human history, is conventionally defined as the massive plague outbreak of 1346 to 1353 c.e. that struck the Black Sea and Mediterranean, extended into the Middle East, North Africa, and western Europe, and killed as much as half the total population of those regions. Yet genetic approaches to plague’s history have established that Yersinia pestis, the causative organism of plague, suddenly diverged in Central Asia at some point before the Black Death, splitting into four new branches—a divergence geneticists have called the “Big Bang.” Drawing on a “biological archive” of genetic evidence, I trace the bacterial descendants of the Big Bang proliferation, comparing that data to historical human activities in and around the area of plague’s emergence. The Mongols, whose empire emerged in 1206, unwittingly moved plague through Central Eurasia in the thirteenth, not the fourteenth, century. Grain shipments that the Mongols brought with them to several sieges, including the siege of Baghdad, were the most likely mechanism of transmission.

The study was conducted taking measurements of deformation features such as fractures and deformation bands on multiple 1D scanlines along fault walls. The resulting datasets are used to plot the frequency distribution of deformation features and to constrain the geometrical width of the damage zone for the studied faults. The damage-zone width of a single fault is constrained by identifying the changes in the slope of cumulative plots made on the frequency data. The cumulative plot further shows high deformation frequency by a steep slope (inner damage zone) and less deformation as a gentle slope (outer damage zone). Statistical distributions of displacement and damage-zone width and their relationship are improved, and show two-slope power-law distributions with a break point at c. 100 m displacement. Bleached sandstones in the studied siliciclastic rocks of Utah are associated with a higher frequency of deformation bands and a wider damage zone compared to the unbleached zone of similar lithology. Fault damage zones in the carbonate rocks of Majella are often host to open fractures (karst), demonstrating that they can also be conductive to fluid flow.","[{""name"": ""A.

Yet this surge of interest leaves at least two important questions unanswered. Where was nationalism before its apparent resurgence? Are contemporary forms of nationalism different from their predecessors, and can these changes be linked to digital technologies? To answer these questions, we argue for the importance of understanding the less visible ways in which digital technologies reproduce our sense of belonging to a world of nations. We discuss three such mechanisms: the architecture of internet domains, the bias of algorithms and the formation of national digital ecosystems. Next, we examine three characteristics of contemporary nationalism that can be partly linked to recent shifts in the global communication ecology: diversification, fragmentation and commodification. We conclude by considering the implications of our arguments for future research in the field.","[{""name"": ""Sabina Mihelj"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Social Sciences and Humanities Loughborough University Loughborough UK""]}, {""name"": ""César Jiménez‐Martínez"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Journalism, Media and Culture Cardiff University Cardiff UK""]}]","[""10.1177/0267323115614485"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199752164.001.0001"", ""10.1093/joc/jqx017"", ""10.1163/1871191X-14011032"", ""10.1111/nana.12480"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-70123-3"", ""10.1177/1940161219862988"", ""10.1177/1469540517690570"", ""10.1080/15405702.2013.751855"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2012.698204"", ""10.1080/10304310903026594"", ""10.1515/popets-2015-0007"", ""10.1177/1748048519880731"", ""10.4159/9780674030305"", ""10.1177/1940161218790035"", ""10.1080/14616700306488"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2018.1428656"", ""10.1017/9781316800058"", ""10.1111/cccr.12152"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1207697"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2007.00273.x"", ""10.1177/1468796808088925"", ""10.1177/1461444809342738"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262525374.003.0009"", ""10.1007/s00146-016-0644-9"", ""10.1177/14614440022225689"", ""10.1177/1750481318771448"", ""10.1080/19392397.2016.1218292"", ""10.1017/9781316534168"", ""10.1017/9781316534168.002"", ""10.1075/jlp.17032.kre"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7_14"", ""10.1080/14672715.2017.1341188"", ""10.4324/9780429447754"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479895120.001.0001"", ""10.28945/3331"", ""10.1017/9781108589451"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04405-3"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-34529-4"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-06147-8"", ""10.4159/9780674369542"", ""10.1080/17544750.2019.1572633"", ""10.1177/0196859917754053"", ""10.1177/1461444814535724"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190876791.001.0001"", ""10.2202/1944-2866.1075"", ""10.1111/comt.12028"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7"", ""10.1111/comt.12001"", ""10.1177/1527476416655384"", ""10.1177/1367877919887757"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199755509.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400884711"", ""10.1145/2447976.2447990"", ""10.1177/1461444814530096"", ""10.1177/1367549417751148"", ""10.1080/23808985.2017.1288551"", ""10.1177/0163443712468605"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190889760.001.0001"", ""10.1093/esr/jcu089"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328521"", ""10.1108/13563280510614483"", ""10.1093/hcr/hqx010""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

SOME KEYWORDS TOWARD DECOLONIAL METHODS: STUDYING SETTLER COLONIAL HISTORIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLENCE FROM TKARONTO,"ABSTRACTThis article explores the relationships among place, knowing, and being in environmental histories. Grounding ourselves in the work of Indigenous scholars from North America and the Pacific, we propose a method of listening and attuning that can attend to the dislocation and abstraction often found in work addressing ecocide and environmental violence. Against the ubiquity of the case‐study approach, we propose a method we call “kin study,” which invites more embedded, expansive, material, and respectful relations to people and lands. This article frames the issues and then proposes, though a dialogue, how kin studies may be constituted and applied in studying environmental histories of the Pacific and Western Canada.","[{""name"": ""ANJA KANNGIESER"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Wollongong  Australia""]}, {""name"": ""ZOE TODD"", ""affiliation"": [""Carleton University""]}]",[],"['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1111/ehr.12821,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,The gender division of labour in early modern England,"AbstractThis article presents new evidence of gendered work patterns in the pre‐industrial economy, providing an overview of women's work in early modern England. Evidence of 4,300 work tasks undertaken by particular women and men was collected from three types of court documents (coroners’ reports, church court depositions, and quarter sessions examinations) from five counties in south‐western England (Cornwall, Devon, Hampshire, Somerset, and Wiltshire) between 1500 and 1700. The findings show that women participated in all the main areas of the economy. However, different patterns of gendered work were identified in different parts of the economy: craft work showed a sharp division of labour and agriculture a flexible division of labour, while differences of gender were less pronounced in everyday commerce. Quantitative evidence of early modern housework and care work in England indicates that such work used less time and was less family‐based than is often assumed. Comparisons with gendered work patterns in early modern Germany and Sweden are drawn and show strong similarities to England. In conclusion it is argued that the gender division of labour cannot be explained by a single factor, as different influences were at play in different parts of the economy.","[{""name"": ""Jane Whittle"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Exeter""]}, {""name"": ""Mark Hailwood"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bristol""]}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190240615.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230250550"", ""10.12987/9780300156911"", ""10.2307/3180153"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195073904.001.0001"", ""10.9783/9780812200553"", ""10.1093/hwj/35.1.22"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00054"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00486.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.1989.tb00501.x"", ""10.1080/03585522.2011.617576"", ""10.1111/hith.10673"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198201540.001.0001"", ""10.1017/jbr.2016.54"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199271320.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226355061.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0424.2008.00535.x"", ""10.1525/9780520916944"", ""10.1515/9780773561250"", ""10.2307/jj.919480"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00588.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198205548.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-0424.12096"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199226252.001.0001"", ""10.1093/hwj/7.1.3"", ""10.3828/lhr.63.1.4"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.1995.tb01422.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-24456-0"", ""10.1080/09612021003634109"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00585.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199600793.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521431415.017"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511599446"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-02802-3"", ""10.1017/S0018246X9300001X"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496110"", ""10.1017/S002205070800065X"", ""10.1017/S0080440105000332"", ""10.2752/175174211X12961586699685"", ""10.1515/9781787441378"", ""10.18356/152cdfb3-en""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

Gasol offers a wide variety of cost models that allow inferring the gas consumption associated to selected types of EVM instructions and/or inferring the number of times that such types of bytecode instructions are executed. Among others, we have cost models to measure only storage opcodes, to measure a selected family of gas-consumption opcodes following the Ethereum’s classification, to estimate the cost of a selected program line, etc. After choosing the desired cost model and the function of interest, Gasol returns to the user an upper bound of the cost for this function. As the gas consumption is often dominated by the instructions that access the storage, Gasol uses the gas analysis to detect under-optimized storage patterns, and includes an (optional) automatic optimization of the selected function. Our tool can be used within an Eclipse plugin for which displays the gas and instructions bounds and, when applicable, the gas-optimized function.","[{""name"": ""Elvira Albert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jesús Correas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pablo Gordillo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guillermo Román-Díez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Albert Rubio"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_46"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69166-2_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_30"", ""10.1145/3167084"", ""10.1145/2993600.2993611"", ""10.1007/3-540-49059-0_14"", ""10.1109/SANER.2017.7884650"", ""10.1145/3276486"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89722-6_10"", ""10.1145/3158136"", ""10.14722/ndss.2018.23082"", ""10.1145/3293882.3330560"", ""10.1145/2976749.2978309"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03427-6_33"", ""10.1145/3274694.3274743"", ""10.1145/3360611"", ""10.1145/3243734.3243780""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1093/pastj/gtaa001,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,"'FUNK MONEY': THE END OF EMPIRES, THE EXPANSION OF TAX HAVENS, AND DECOLONIZATION AS AN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EVENT","Abstract This article explores the question of what happened to European assets in the process of decolonization. It argues that decolonization created a money panic of sorts that led white settlers, businessmen, and officials to seek to liquidate assets they owned and move funds out of the colonial world. Instead of being repatriated to metropolitan countries with high tax rates and exchange controls, money moved to tax havens. Decolonization thus provided an important share of early postwar tax haven business in a period when tax havens and offshore finance expanded during the 1950s and 1960s. In turn, the withdrawal of Euro-American investments from the decolonizing world set the stage for the politics of development and modernization in the coming decades. Ironically, the outflow of funds during decolonization and the subsequent return of some funds in restructured form as investments by multinational and other companies soon caused difficulties in newly independent developing countries. Companies soon found ways to rebook profits to have occurred in a tax haven rather than in the developing world, thus depriving low-income countries from tax revenue. The withdrawal of Euro-American investments from the colonial world during decolonization moreover had implications for the growth of portfolio investment, as funds removed from colonies were often invested through a tax haven onwards in US securities. All in all, decolonization was an economic and financial event that is only beginning to emerge in full detail.","[{""name"": ""Vanessa Ogle"", ""affiliation"": [""University of California, Berkeley""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Archean granites define a continuum of compositions between several end members: (i) magmas that originated by partial melting of a range of crustal sources, from amphibolites to metasediments (‘C-type’ granitoids); and (ii) magmas that formed by partial melting of an enriched mantle source, the most common agent of enrichment being felsic (TTG) melts. Differences in the degree of metasomatism results in different primitive liquids for these ‘M-type’ granitoids. Mixed sources, differentiation and interactions between different melts resulted in a continuous range of compositions, defined by variable proportions of each end member. During the Archean, evolved crustal sources (sediments or felsic crust) and metasomatized mantle sources become increasingly more important, mirroring the progressive maturation of crustal segments and the stabilization of the global tectonic system.","[{""name"": ""Jean-François Moyen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.lithos.2010.07.026"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(00)00103-0"",

Cretaceous third- and fourth-order hothouse sea-level changes, the sequence-stratigraphic framework, are linked to Milankovitch-type climate cycles, especially the longer-period sequence-building bands of 405 kyr and 1.2 myr. In the absence of continental ice sheets during Cretaceous hothouse phases (e.g. Cenomanian–Turonian), growing evidence indicates groundwater-related sea-level cycles: (1) the existence of Milankovitch-type humid-arid climate oscillations, proven via intense humid weathering records during times of regression and sea-level lowstands; (2) missing or inverse relationships of sea-level and the marine δ 18 O archives, i.e. the lack of a pronounced positive excursion, cooling signal during sea-level lowstands; and (3) the anti-phase relationship of sea and lake levels, attesting to high groundwater levels and charged continental aquifers during sea-level lowstands. This substantiates the aquifer-eustasy hypothesis. Rates of aquifer-eustatic sea-level change remain hard to decipher; however, reconstructions range from a very conservative minimum estimate of 0.04 mm a −1 (longer time intervals) to 0.7 mm a −1 (shorter, probably asymmetric cycles). Remarkably, aquifer-eustasy is recognized as a significant component for the Anthropocene sea-level budget.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Sames"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Geodynamics and Sedimentology, University of Vienna, UZA 2, Althanstrasse 14, 1090 Vienna, Austria"", ""Sam Noble Museum, University of Oklahoma, 2401 Chautauqua Ave, Norman, OK 73072, USA""]}, {""name"": ""M.

In this article, we briefly respond to the critique of our work, further clarifying and refining our plea for clearly distinct conceptualizations of populism and nationalism in dialogue with the considerations formulated by Rogers Brubaker.

Primary I-type granites represent fractionated liquids from intermediate magma systems of broadly andesitic composition. Fluid-fluxed melting of igneous rocks that resided in the continental crust generates secondary I-type granites. The former are directly related to subduction, with Cordilleran batholiths as the most characteristic examples. Experiments with lower crust granulite sources, in the presence of water, show that amphibole is formed by a water-fluxed peritectic rehydration melting reaction . Entrainment of only 10% of restites composed of amphibole, pyroxene, plagioclase and magnetite, is sufficient to account for discrepancies in aluminium saturation index and maficity in secondary I-type granites. Lower crust granulite xenoliths, attached to a sanukitoid containing 6 wt% water, have been used in two-layer capsules to test fluid-fluxed melting reactions as the origin of secondary I-type granites. It is proposed that sanukitoid magmas act as water donors that trigger extensive melting of the lower crust, giving rise to granodioritic liquids. Because primary granites are related to coeval subduction, and secondary ones are crustal melts from older subduction-related rocks, the distinction between both I-types is essential in tectonic reconstructions of ancient orogenic belts.","[{""name"": ""Antonio Castro"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/286335a0"", ""10.1007/s00410-008-0351-8"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2003.08.003"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00929-9"", ""10.1093/petrology/egi084"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2014.07.004"", ""10.1093/petrology/egh019"", ""10.1130/G33455.1"", ""10.1086/314356"", ""10.1093/petrology/33.5.1039"", ""10.1007/BF00306477"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.S7-XV.3-4.209"", ""10.1144/sjg40010049"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2007.09.012"", ""10.1007/s004100050511"", ""10.1093/petrology/44.7.1309"", ""10.1093/petrology/egq019"", ""10.1016/j.jsames.2011.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.jsames.2011.03.011"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2012.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2013.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2012.08.011"", ""10.1017/S0263593300014139"", ""10.1046/j.1440-0952.2000.00766.x"", ""10.1017/S0263593300000973"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2012.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2011.07.004"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-05313-2"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2003.09.003"", ""10.1086/314363"", ""10.1139/e05-022"", ""10.1130/G39956.1"", ""10.1029/GL004i010p00465"", ""10.1093/petrology/egp010"", ""10.1093/petrology/egq078"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2018.09.004"", ""10.1007/s004100050244"", ""10.1130/G33371.1"", ""10.1144/jgs.158.3.521"", ""10.1093/petrology/42.11.2033"", ""10.1093/petrology/egl030"", ""10.1130/G20018.1"", ""10.1130/MEM28"", ""10.1007/s004100050276"", ""10.1038/nature05191"", ""10.1144/1467-787302-010"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2007.01.007"", ""10.1007/BF00372365"", ""10.1016/S0016-7037(03)00416-2"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2011.10.022"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-61049-3"", ""10.1007/s00531-016-1434-9"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2008.06.017"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(01)00165-2"", ""10.1007/s00410-005-0056-1"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2007.09.025"", ""10.2138/am-2015-5121"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511535581"", ""10.1007/BF00402106"", ""10.1093/petrology/egm084"", ""10.2138/am-2001-11-1208"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2004.04.055"", ""10.1007/BF00457293"", ""10.1007/s00410-016-1281-5"", ""10.1017/S1755691009016120"", ""10.1038/ngeo1781"", ""10.2475/ajs.274.4.321"", ""10.1007/s00410-008-0371-4"", ""10.1007/BF00287111"", ""10.1016/S1464-1895(01)00059-X"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.02.002"", ""10.1007/s00410-016-1278-0"", ""10.2475/ajs.283.10.993"", ""10.1007/s004100050495"", ""10.1016/j.jsames.2008.11.007"", ""10.1144/gsjgs.156.4.0673"", ""10.1016/S0024-4937(98)00080-2"", ""10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2008.06.024"", ""10.1029/94JB03376"", ""10.1093/petrology/egh071"", ""10.1086/623788"", ""10.1007/BF00384745"", ""10.1016/j.gsf.2014.02.006"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(01)00481-2"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-5832-9"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2012.11.044"", ""10.1007/s00410-013-0854-9"", ""10.1093/petrology/36.4.891"", ""10.1007/s00410-005-0677-4"", ""10.1080/11035895709447195"", ""10.1038/nature08510"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2016.12.017"", ""10.1130/B32028.1"", ""10.1086/662033"", ""10.1029/95RG01302"", ""10.1016/B0-08-043751-6/03016-4"", ""10.1038/310222a0"", ""10.1007/BF00283225"", ""10.1007/s00410-004-0632-9"", ""10.1093/petrology/43.2.291"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.1988.038.01.23"", ""10.1046/j.1440-0952.2001.00880.x"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019<0078:ROSEIT>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1007/BF00307341"", ""10.1139/e89-145"", ""10.1093/petrology/egy017"", ""10.1093/petrology/37.6.1579"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2014.08.021"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(77)90003-8"", ""10.2138/am.2010.3371"", ""10.1093/petrology/27.5.1095"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2005.12.001""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],['Geophysics'],"[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"

Tectonism started with the formation of a Tonian passive margin on a Baltica-derived ribbon dispersed into the Mirovoi Ocean. Obduction of an oceanic terrane onto the ribbon produced olistostromes, deformation and metamorphism before 750 Ma. Obduction was followed by a Tonian (750–730 Ma) arc on the created composite crust. A pause in magmatism between 730 and 700 Ma is the next event. Subsequently, a Cyrogenian (700–670 Ma) arc was formed, which may have collided with Baltica or another buoyant element nearby. Thereafter, a long-lasting (640–565 Ma) continental arc was erected which, combined with the late Ediacaran–Early Paleozoic sedimentary cover, represents the hallmark of West Avalonia. A Caribbean-style incursion of the Ediacaran arc into the widening Tornquist gap between Amazonia and Baltica led to a diachronous collision with the Ganderian arc. Strike-slip slivering produced a complex transfer of terranes to both: Carolinia and smaller terranes to Ganderia, and East Avalonia to West Avalonia. The Rheic Ocean opened diachronously at c. 500 Ma, following a plate reorganization and re-establishment of an oblique subduction zone beneath Amazonia. As a result, Avalonia and Ganderia became progressively separated and dispersed into the Iapetus Ocean.","[{""name"": ""C.

The recently determined Bajocian age for salt deposition (using 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopes) is integrated by modifying the plate kinematic framework with a new Equatorial Atlantic reconstruction that expands the gap between the Americas by 180 km over many kinematic frameworks. NW–SE synrift lithospheric extension along western Florida–Bahamas is estimated at 40%, implying thinned continental crust beneath Great Bank, Bahamas, the conjugate for the Guianas Basin margin. In cordilleran Mexico (excluding the Yucatán Block), we propose two new means by which continental crust migrated into the ‘Colombian overlap position’ of Pangaean reconstructions. The first involved Jurassic–earliest Cretaceous sinistral displacement of the Oaxaca Block along a NW–SE ‘North Oaxaca Transfer’ through or adjacent to the Cuicateco Belt. The second applies to the continental crust in eastern Mexico to the north of Cuicateco, a region we refer to as ‘peninsular Mexico’. There, most Mesozoic basement faults trend NW–SE, and the common occurrence of Permian mid-crustal anatectic basement directly beneath Mesozoic red beds, salt and marine strata suggests extreme extension prior to the onset of sedimentation. Because these Mesozoic sedimentary sections typically sum to 3–8 km in thickness, the post-rift crust of peninsular Mexico probably averaged about 25 km in thickness before later orogenesis. Our reconstructions suggest that this Triassic–Middle Jurassic extension approached 100%, beginning with overthickened Alleghanian (Permian) crust about 50 km in thickness in palaeo-northern Mexico, and was accompanied by a significant sinistral component broadly distributed across the rift array. The updated model provides an exploration and kinematic framework for the entire region.","[{""name"": ""James Pindell"", ""affiliation"": [""Tectonic Analysis Ltd, Chestnut House, Burton Park,

10.1111/nana.12663,NATIONS AND NATIONALISM,0603 World History; 0304 Ethnology; 0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,Nationalism and populism on the left: The case of Podemos,"AbstractThis article provides an empirical exploration of the relation between nationalism and populism on the left of the political spectrum. The Spanish party Podemos is a key case study for such an analysis, as it is a left‐populist actor that has made extensive use of nationalist rhetoric in its discourse. Through a discourse analysis on a corpus that includes speeches by Podemos leadership and primary data such as interviews and original unpublished material, this article studies the nationalist dimension of Podemos and its relation with the party's much‐discussed populism. The analysis shows that the Podemos leadership deliberately embeds nationalism in its populist strategy: Nationalism is a central element of the party's populist project and serves to advance an alternative form of national identification that challenges that of the right wing. Through a resignification of national pride and belonging, Podemos constructs an image of Spain that refers to an inclusive welfare state, to people's mobilization, and to a moral community that is not delimited by lingual or ethnic particularisms.","[{""name"": ""Jacopo Custodi"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Political and Social Sciences Scuola Normale Superiore  Florence Italy""]}]","[""10.1080/13183222.2019.1606562"", ""10.4324/9781315226446-4"", ""10.1080/23745118.2019.1632576"", ""10.1080/17449057.2018.1532633"", ""10.1111/nana.12480"", ""10.1080/1362102042000214705"", ""10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7"", ""10.17141/iconos.52.2015.1670"", ""10.1075/jlp.6.2.08car"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63826-3_10"", ""10.1177/03058298830120020701"", ""10.1111/newe.12001"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12321"", ""10.4324/9781351022668"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083"", ""10.1111/nana.12575"", ""10.1093/esr/jcu087"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63432-6_6"", ""10.1177/0032329208316570"", ""10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog114"", ""10.1080/13569319808420771"", ""10.1002/9781444355093.ch24"", ""10.21308/recp.44.09"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00165"", ""10.1108/9781839092039"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63432-6_1"", ""10.4324/9780203934753"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.02050.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63826-3_11"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521439612"", ""10.1057/9780230523364"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1fx4gx6"", ""10.4324/9781315180823"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330087"", ""10.1080/13569317.2016.1150136"", ""10.1080/17449057.2010.507114"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-47479-3"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1093/icon/mom039"", ""10.1080/01419870.2015.1009480"", ""10.1080/0969229042000249831"", ""10.1177/0032321716647400"", ""10.5565/rev/papers.2222"", ""10.1075/jlp.17025.sta"", ""10.1080/17405904.2017.1309325""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/jsh/shy118,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,The Emmet's Inch: Small History in a Digital Age,"Abstract Digitization has usually been considered a facilitator of what has been called “big” history. While digital history projects increasingly make good and sensitive use of individual and granular records and use them to bring human complexity into a larger analysis, the digitization of published material and archives have mostly been discussed by historians in aggregate: they are valued chiefly for their ability to give us “big data” about phenomena in the past. Yet for those interested in questions and methodologies of microhistory, biographical history, history from below, and other kinds of what we might call “small” history, the digitization of archives and individual records is an equally transformative development. This article will examine the way that digitization has changed how historians discover, concatenate, and communicate small stories in their narratives and arguments. I will consider the practice and the ethics of telling and digitizing individual histories, and I will suggest some different ways of dealing with the new boundaries—and boundlessness—that the “mass digitized turn” throws up, particularly for historians working in the period after 1800. Finally, amidst an increased emphasis on digitization and big data in the field of history, I want to assert the continuing power of all kinds of small histories to explain the past and to connect it to our present, and ourselves.","[{""name"": ""Julia Laite"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The first is the revival of Tsarist imperial nationalist and White Russian émigré nationalist denials of the existence of Ukraine and Ukrainians. Russian imperial nationalists believe the eastern Slavs constitute a pan Russian nation of Great Russians, Little Russians and White Russian branches of one Russian nation. The second is the cult of the Great Patriotic War and Joseph Stalin and the revival of Soviet era discourse on Ukrainian Nazis (i.e., nationalists). A Ukrainian nationalist in the Soviet Union and Vladimir Putin's Russia is any Ukrainian who seeks a future for his/her country outside the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Russian World and who upholds an ethnic Ukrainian (rather than a Little Russian) identity. The Russian World is the new core of the Eurasian Economic Union, Russian President Vladimir Putin's alternative to the EU's Eastern Partnership. In the contemporary domain, Ukrainian nationalists are Nazi's irrespective of their language preference or political beliefs and if they do not accept they are Little Russians. Putin's invasion goal of denazification is a genocidal goal to eradicate the ‘anti‐Russia’ that has allegedly been nurtured by Ukrainian nationalists and the West.","[{""name"": ""Taras Kuzio"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy  Kyiv Ukraine""]}]","[""10.1515/9781474410434-006"", ""10.2747/1060-586X.19.4.289"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2017.10.001"", ""10.1080/13518046.2019.1684002"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2019.10.007"", ""10.1080/15387216.2019.1703777"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2015.1023004"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2016.01.002"", ""10.1080/09668136.2020.1862060""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Their generation is intimately related to crustal thickening and the active deformation and metamorphism of metapelites. Data from Proterozoic to present day orogenic belts show that collisional leucogranites (CLGs) are peraluminous, with muscovite, biotite and tourmaline as characteristic minerals. Isotopic ratios uniquely identify the metapelitic sequences in which CLGs occur as sources. Organic material in pelitic sources results in f O 2 in CLGs that is usually below the fayalite–magnetite–quartz buffer. Most CLGs form under vapour-poor conditions with melting involving a peritectic breakdown of muscovite. The low concentrations of Mg, Fe and Ti that characterize CLGs are largely related to biotite–melt equilibria in the source rocks. Concentrations of Zr, Th and rare earth elements are lower than expected from zircon and monazite saturation models because these minerals often remain enclosed in residual biotite during melting. Melting involving muscovite may limit the temperatures achieved in the source regions. A lack of nearby mantle heat sources in thick collisional orogens has led to thermal models for the generation of CLGs that involve flux melting, or large amounts of radiogenic heat generation, or decompression melting or shear heating, the last one emphasizing the link of leucogranites and their sources to crustal-scale shear zone systems.","[{""name"": ""Peter I.

10.1017/S1740022820000029,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Slavery and the new history of capitalism,"AbstractThe new history of capitalism (NHC) places a great deal of emphasis on slavery as a crucial world institution. Slavery, it is alleged, arose out of, and underpinned, capitalist development. This article starts by showing the intellectual and scholarly foundations of some of the broad conclusions of the NHC. It proceeds by arguing that capitalist transformation must rely on a global framework of analysis. The article considers three critiques in relation to the NHC. First, the NHC overemphasizes the importance of coercion to economic growth in the eighteenth century. We argue that what has been called ‘war capitalism’ might be better served by an analysis in which the political economy of European states and empires, rather than coercion, is a key factor in the transformation of capitalism at a global scale. Second, in linking slavery to industrialization, the NHC proposes a misleading chronology. Cotton produced in large quantities in the United States came too late to cause an Industrial Revolution which, we argue, developed gradually from the latter half of the seventeenth century and which was well established by the 1790s, when cotton started to arrive from the American South. During early industrialization, sugar, not cotton, was the main plantation crop in the Americas. Third, the NHC is overly concentrated on production and especially on slave plantation economies. It underplays the ‘power of consumption’, where consumers came to purchase increasing amounts of plantation goods, including sugar, rice, indigo, tobacco, cotton, and coffee. To see slavery’s role in fostering the preconditions of industrialization and the Great Divergence, we must tell a story about slavery’s place in supporting the expansion of consumption, as well as a story about production","[{""name"": ""Trevor Burnard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Giorgio Riello"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1111/hith.12190,HISTORY AND THEORY,0603 World History,HISTORICAL FUTURES,"ABSTRACTThis article outlines the agenda of a collective research project that aims to explore modalities of historical futures that constitute our current historical condition. To present the collective work adequately, we have teamed up with History and Theory and initiated a long‐term serial publishing experiment. In the coming years, each issue of the journal will feature contributions to this research endeavor. In our project‐opening piece, we briefly introduce the experiment and the premises of the collective research agenda. We begin by recounting the many ways in which increasingly towering novel future prospects have begun to capture the scholarly world's attention across disciplinary boundaries. We then introduce the notion of historical futures. Crediting theoretical inspirations and paying intellectual debts to conceptual relatives, we define “historical futures” as the plurality of transitional relations between apprehensions of the past and anticipated futures. At the core of the article, we formulate our call for a collective investigation of modalities of historical futures and sketch three basic sets of concerns that the explorative works in this experiment may address: kinds of transitions from past to futures, kinds of anticipatory practices, and kinds of registers as interpretive tools that position such practices on a variety of spectrums between two poles (for instance, a value register with the poles of catastrophic and redemptive futures). Finally, we close with a brief note about the necessity of collective endeavors.","[{""name"": ""ZOLTÁN BOLDIZSÁR SIMON"", ""affiliation"": [""Bielefeld University and Leiden University""]}, {""name"": ""MAREK TAMM"", ""affiliation"": [""Tallinn University""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1093/pastj/gtab024,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,Viewpoint New Approaches to the 'Plague of Justinian'*,"Abstract This viewpoint is meant as a contribution to debate over the nature and significance of the ‘Justinianic Plague’, which struck Western Eurasia between the sixth and eighth centuries ce, and the methodological challenges posed by attempting to reconcile historical evidence with that derived from the realm of the Natural Sciences. In recent years, major advances have been made in our genetic understanding of the Justinianic Plague. Yet growing scientific interest in the disease has coincided with a concerted effort amongst some historians to seek to downplay its historical importance. This article surveys our current state of historical and scientific understanding with respect to the sixth-century pandemic, responds to the recent attempts to argue that the disease had only a minimal impact on the societies that it struck, and considers how historians should respond to the burgeoning scientific evidence in order to take study of the plague forward. For co-operation between geneticists, environmental scientists, archaeologists and historians, it argues, offers the chance to transform our understanding of how, when and where the plague spread and to assess its impact across the Afro-Eurasian world as a whole, and not just on the Mediterranean, for which we have our best written sources.","[{""name"": ""Peter Sarris"", ""affiliation"": [""Trinity College, Cambridge""]}]",[],"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']",['Genetics'],"[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0710 生物学', 0.733), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7315)]]"

10.1111/ehr.12962,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Slavery and Anglo-American capitalism revisited,"AbstractBritish and American debates on the relationship between slavery and economic growth have had little interaction with each other. This article attempts intellectual arbitrage by joining these two literatures. The linkage turns on the neglected part two of the ‘Williams thesis’: that slavery and the slave trade, once vital for the expansion of British industry and commerce, were no longer needed by the nineteenth century. In contrast to recent assertions of the centrality of slavery for US economic development, the article argues that part two of the Williams thesis applies with equal force to nineteenth‐century America. Unlike sugar, cotton required no large investments of fixed capital and could be cultivated efficiently at any scale, in locations that would have been settled by free farmers in the absence of slavery. Cheap cotton was undoubtedly important for the growth of textiles, but cheap cotton did not require slavery. The best evidence for this claim is that after two decades of war, abolition, and Reconstruction, cotton prices returned to their prewar levels. In both countries, the rise of anti‐slavery sentiment was not driven by the prospect of direct economic benefits, but major economic interest groups acquiesced in abolition because they no longer saw slavery as indispensable.","[{""name"": ""Gavin Wright"", ""affiliation"": [""Stanford University""]}]","[""10.1257/0002828054201305"", ""10.2307/1888272"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107050822"", ""10.9783/9780812293098"", ""10.2307/204282"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2008.00438.x"", ""10.2307/2210413"", ""10.1086/683036"", ""10.1017/ssh.2017.39"", ""10.1017/S0022050700019574"", ""10.1017/S002205070006544X"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.1962.tb02239.x"", ""10.1017/S0022050700078566"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195093469.001.0001"", ""10.2307/204654"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674735620"", ""10.1017/S0022050700024670"", ""10.1515/9781400831883"", ""10.2307/2568431"", ""10.1017/S0022050717000493"", ""10.1017/S0022050700011943"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00414.x"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719091834.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0022050700016466"", ""10.1017/S0022050700006641"", ""10.1017/S0022050700011396"", ""10.1017/S0022050700015023"", ""10.1017/S002205071700016X"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719091834.003.0003"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801451089.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511583940"", ""10.1016/0014-4983(88)90003-4"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674181304"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjsf5q7"", ""10.4159/9780674973817"", ""10.1126/science.364.6435.16"", ""10.1111/ehr.12696"", ""10.2307/1919050"", ""10.56021/9780801873942"", ""10.1515/9781400880348"", ""10.2307/2597624"", ""10.9783/9780812293098-005"", ""10.2307/3124830"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521394420.007"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511512124.012"", ""10.7312/myer93866"", ""10.9783/9780812208313"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511523892.010"", ""10.1017/S1740022806000076"", ""10.1017/S0147547915000393"", ""10.1017/S0022050708000831"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2017.12.002"", ""10.37234/HVKPEXAZ"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674435025"", ""10.1017/S0022050700047409"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812385"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511523892.012"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139198868"", ""10.1093/jahist/jaw316"", ""10.4159/9780674988590"", ""10.1017/S0022050710000537"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300192001.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781139226585"", ""10.2307/3125182"", ""10.1057/9780230513600"", ""10.1080/00076799500000003"", ""10.3386/w25197"", ""10.1017/S0022050700030291"", ""10.1017/S0022050700017927"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511778575"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469624242.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0022050700081778"", ""10.1017/S0022050700033593"", ""10.1017/S0022050700040134"", ""10.2307/2598081""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/pastj/gtz061,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,"PETITIONS, PARLIAMENT AND POLITICAL CULTURE: PETITIONING THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, 1780-1918","Abstract This article analyses nearly one million petitions received by the House of Commons to reveal a culture of petitioning that recast the political culture of modern Britain and Ireland. It argues, first, that petitions provided a much more regular and continuous form of interaction between people and Parliament than elections. Second, petitioning–meaning the practices associated with the drafting, signing and presentation of petitions–enabled a vibrant, performative public politics. Third, petitions and petitioning were relatively open, inclusive forms of political participation since all British subjects enjoyed the formal right to petition. We examine the role of formidable campaigns of mass mobilisation, but also humble appeals of marginalised individuals. Our data has significant implications for our understanding of the nationalisation, organisation, and popularisation of politics in this period. We argue that attention to petitions helps us to decentre parliamentary elections as the principal connection between local and national politics. Indeed, petitioners responded to the shifting boundaries between the central and devolved state in deciding to which authorities they would direct petitions. Petitioning campaigns pioneered the mass, organised, national movements that would gradually emerge as the hallmark of stronger political parties. This did not undermine petitioning. However, the consequent growth of disciplined parties strengthened executive power, at the expense of parliamentary government, redirected petitions from the Commons. Furthermore, the continuing expansion of petitioning alongside extensions of the franchise suggests that petitions did not function as an ersatz ballot. Rather, petitions and debates between parliamentarians and petitioners over the meaning of growing lists of signatories suggest that petitioning catalysed a range of other forms of participation and hence forged an ever more popular politics.","[{""name"": ""Richard Huzzey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henry Miller"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'History']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

During such crises, the ordinary and unnoticed routines that structure everyday life are thrust into the spotlight as people struggle to maintain or recreate a sense of normalcy. Drawing on a range of cases including China, Russia, the UK, and USA, we examine three categories of everyday practice during the COVID-19 pandemic that respond to disruptions in daily routines and seek a return to national normality: performing national solidarities and exclusions by wearing face masks; consuming the nation in the form of panic buying and conspiracy theories; and enforcing foreign policies through social media and embodiment. This analysis thus breaks with existing works on everyday nationalism and banal nationalism that typically focus on pervasively unnoticed forms of nationalism during settled times, and it challenges approaches to contentious politics that predict protest mobilization for change rather than restoration of the status quo ante. In highlighting the ways that unsettled times disrupt domestic and international structures, this work also presents a first attempt to link everyday nationalism with growing work on international practices.","[{""name"": ""J.

10.1093/pastj/gtaa018,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,HOW DID THE FEUDAL ECONOMY WORK? THE ECONOMIC LOGIC OF MEDIEVAL SOCIETIES,"Abstract This article aims to create a model for the underlying economic logic of the feudal economy, which can then be contrasted with the much better-known models for the capitalist economy. It does so by developing a discussion of a very frequent pattern in pre-industrial, feudal, societies: active local economies with highly developed exchange, which never, even remotely, developed in the direction of capitalism. It is argued here that this is because they obeyed a different economic logic, rather than just a simpler version of the logic of the capitalist world, which was somehow ‘blocked’ from developing any further. The article then sets out the basic elements of what that logic could be.","[{""name"": ""Chris Wickham"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford, University of Birmingham""]}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1111/ehr.13019,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,"An introduction to the history of infectious diseases, epidemics and the early phases of the long-run decline in mortality","AbstractThis article, written during the COVID‐19 epidemic, provides a general introduction to the long‐term history of infectious diseases, epidemics and the early phases of the spectacular long‐term improvements in life expectancy since 1750, primarily with reference to English history. The story is a fundamentally optimistic one. In 2019 global life expectancy was approaching 73 years. In 1800 it was probably about 30. To understand the origins of this transition, we have to look at the historical sequence by which so many causes of premature death have been vanquished over time. In England that story begins much earlier than often supposed, in the years around 1600. The first two ‘victories’ were over famine and plague. However, economic changes with negative influences on mortality meant that, despite this, life expectancies were either falling or stable between the late sixteenth and mid eighteenth centuries. The late eighteenth and early nineteenth century saw major declines in deaths from smallpox, malaria and typhus and the beginnings of the long‐run increases in life expectancy. The period also saw urban areas become capable of demographic growth without a constant stream of migrants from the countryside: a necessary precondition for the global urbanization of the last two centuries and for modern economic growth. Since 1840 the highest national life expectancy globally has increased by three years in every decade.","[{""name"": ""Leigh Shaw‐Taylor"", ""affiliation"": [""Senior Lecturer in History, Faculty of History; Co‐director of the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure University of Cambridge""]}]","[""10.1093/ereh/het013"", ""10.1017/9781316841235"", ""10.1017/S0022050717000092"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198805830.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2594881"", ""10.2307/2595837"", ""10.1111/ehr.12573"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139031110"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316424032"", ""10.1111/ehr.12098"", ""10.1111/ehr.12964"", ""10.1111/ehr.12112"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00599.x"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.04.019"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2018.1525755"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511581847"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2016.10.061"", ""10.3998/mpub.14163"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511975912"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817649"", ""10.1111/ehr.12942"", ""10.2307/2598176"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2013.870491"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00160"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2006.00364.x"", ""10.1515/9781782043690"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00510.x"", ""10.1017/9781316841235.007"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.12023"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511523403"", ""10.2307/2594969"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511895494"", ""10.1515/9781580468718"", ""10.1186/s12879-019-3750-8"", ""10.1515/9781400829897"", ""10.1126/science.1069675"", ""10.2307/2594505"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00620.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316036495"", ""10.1111/ehr.12097"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198283287.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2595884"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511599446"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00084"", ""10.1017/S0022050700034549"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496127"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511660344""]","['Environmental Science', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis', 'Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

The observations suggest that these salt basins shared a common evolution. Crustal faulting gradually shifted basinward. Consequent thermal/loading subsidence plus lower-crustal thinning generated basinward-shifting accommodation for sag sequences, but slow sedimentation relative to subsidence resulted in deep depressions. A switch to symmetrical boudinage of thinned crust created the troughs and possible reactive mantle diapirs.

The technique aims to fix the logic of the network at an intermediate layer or at the last layer. NNrepair first uses fault localization to find potentially faulty network parameters (such as the weights) and then performs repair using constraint solving to apply small modifications to the parameters to remedy the defects. We present novel strategies to enable precise yet efficient repair such as inferring correctness specifications to act as oracles for intermediate layer repair, and generation of experts for each class. We demonstrate the technique in the context of three different scenarios: (1) Improving the overall accuracy of a model, (2) Fixing security vulnerabilities caused by poisoning of training data and (3) Improving the robustness of the network against adversarial attacks. Our evaluation on MNIST and CIFAR-10 models shows that NNrepair can improve the accuracy by 45.56% points on poisoned data and 10.40% points on adversarial data. NNrepair also provides small improvement in the overall accuracy of models, without requiring new data or re-training.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Usman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Divya Gopinath"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Youcheng Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yannic Noller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Corina S.

Evidence from Reconstruction,"This paper exploits the history of Reconstruction after the American Civil War to estimate the effect of politician race on public finance. While the effect of black politicians is positive and significant, black officials may be endogenous to electoral preferences for redistribution. I therefore use the number of free blacks in the antebellum era (1860) as an instrument for black political leaders during Reconstruction. Instrumental variables (IV) estimates show that an additional black official increased per capita county tax revenue by $0.20, more than an hour’s wage at the time. The effect was not persistent, however, disappearing entirely once black politicians were removed from office at Reconstruction’s end. Consistent with the stated policy objectives of black officials, I find positive effects of black politicians on land tenancy and black literacy. These results suggest that black political leaders had large effects on public finance and individual outcomes over and above electoral preferences.","[{""name"": ""Trevon D.

10.1093/jsh/shz057,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,From Bondage to Precariousness? New Perspectives on Labor and Social History,"Abstract This article pursues two goals. First, it reviews recent literature calling for a revised and extended history of work. Based on that review, it then explores the possibility of a new, empirically based analytical and methodological framework for the study of labor relations and the reinterpretation of contemporary issues, including precariousness, “modern slavery,” social inequality, and dependence. We contend that viewing labor relations as standardly diverse, coexisting, entangled, and overlapping across history provides an alternative organizing principle for the research field and is central to the understanding of larger social processes. To this end, we propose a contextualized, interrelational and transepochal approach to labor relations and labor experiences and discuss the potential of three research strategies: the analysis of the historical semantics of labor relations, the detailed study of coercion, and the historical investigation of the relation between precariousness and flexibility.","[{""name"": ""Christian G De Vito"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juliane Schiel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthias van Rossum"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

These boundary commissions were the largest ever sent to the Americas and coincided with broader imperial reforms enacted throughout the hemisphere. Where Caciques and Mapmakers Met considers what these efforts meant to Indigenous peoples whose lands the border crossed. Moving beyond common frameworks that assess mapped borders strictly via colonial law or Native sovereignty, it examines the interplay between imperial and Indigenous spatial imaginaries. What results is an intricate spatial history of border making in southeastern South America (present-day Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay) with global implications. Drawing upon manuscripts from over two dozen archives in seven countries, Jeffrey Erbig traces on-the-ground interactions between Ibero-American colonists, Jesuit and Guaraní mission-dwellers, and autonomous Indigenous peoples as they responded to ever-changing notions of territorial possession. It reveals that Native agents shaped when and where the border was drawn, and fused it to their own territorial claims. While mapmakers' assertions of Indigenous disappearance or subjugation shaped historiographical imaginaries thereafter, Erbig reveals that the formation of a border was contingent upon Native engagement and authority.","[{""name"": ""Jeffrey Alan Jr. Erbig"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Developing cross-section-scale understanding of these systems necessitates structural interpretation. However, over the past several decades a false distinction has arisen between some forms of so-called fault-related folding and buckle folding. We investigate the origins of this confusion and seek to develop unified approaches for interpreting fold–thrust belts that incorporate deformation arising both from the amplification of buckling instabilities and from localized shear failures (thrust faults). Discussions are illustrated using short case studies from the Bolivian Subandean chain (Incahuasi anticline), the Canadian Cordillera (Livingstone anticlinorium) and Subalpine chains of France and Switzerland. Only fault–bend folding is purely fault-related and other forms, such as fault-propagation and detachment folds, all involve components of buckling. Better integration of understanding of buckling processes, the geometries and structural evolutions that they generate may help to understand how deformation is distributed within fold–thrust belts. It may also reduce the current biases engendered by adopting a narrow range of idealized geometries when constructing cross-sections and evaluating structural evolution in these systems.","[{""name"": ""Robert W.

In this paper, we claim that studying the global history of capitalism through the lens of commodity frontiers and using commodity regimes as an analytical framework is crucial to understanding the origins and nature of capitalism, and thus the modern world. We argue that commodity frontiers identify capitalism as a process rooted in a profound restructuring of the countryside and nature. They connect processes of extraction and exchange with degradation, adaptation and resistance in rural peripheries. To account for the enormous variety of actors and places involved in this history is a critical challenge in the social sciences, and one to which global history can contribute crucial insights.","[{""name"": ""Sven Beckert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ulbe Bosma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mindi Schneider"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eric Vanhaute"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Agricultural and Biological Sciences'],['General Agricultural and Biological Sciences'],"[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7446), ('0909 草学', 0.741)]]"

In this article I first clear up some misconceptions and situate the debate in the Marxian tradition from which it arose. I argue that while non‐Marxian accounts of capitalism fail to explain the key social transformations that have accompanied the rise of capitalism globally, Marxian accounts have failed to comprehend similar transformations that occurred on American slave plantations in the 19th century. I then present a general model of capitalism, building on earlier work by Brenner and Wood, that both incorporates and explains the distinctive dynamics of capitalist slavery in the antebellum South.","[{""name"": ""John Clegg"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1006/exeh.2000.0762"", ""10.2307/1888272"", ""10.1163/156920611X592364"", ""10.1080/01615449909598939"", ""10.1093/jahist/jau357"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2012.04.001"", ""10.1017/S0020859017000190"", ""10.1093/past/70.1.30"", ""10.1093/past/97.1.16"", ""10.5871/bacad/9780197264034.003.0004"", ""10.1086/683036"", ""10.1017/ssh.2017.39"", ""10.1017/S0021875818000464"", ""10.1086/258020"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195160406.001.0001"", ""10.2307/3124246"", ""10.1017/S1467222700007291"", ""10.1017/S0022050700076439"", ""10.1016/S1045-2354(03)00102-3"", ""10.1017/S0022050700099496"", ""10.1080/14664650008567022"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226279473.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2702146"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6281.2010.00306.x"", ""10.2307/2587364"", ""10.1353/cwh.2019.0015"", ""10.4159/9780674039155"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjsf5q7"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815393"", ""10.1017/S0022050700033866"", ""10.1515/9781400880348"", ""10.1111/j.1536-7150.1961.tb00791.x"", ""10.1017/S0022050715000996"", ""10.1163/9789004326071"", ""10.1353/jer.2019.0029"", ""10.1017/S0147547915000393"", ""10.3386/w16494"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2017.12.002"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.03.080177.002203"", ""10.1177/000271621003500105"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004201040.i-298"", ""10.1590/2236-463320181908"", ""10.18061/dsq.v32i3.3267"", ""10.1006/exeh.2000.0763"", ""10.1353/jer.2014.0043"", ""10.1215/00382876-2009-033"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511549793"", ""10.4159/9780674988590"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300192001.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2208625"", ""10.2307/2191238"", ""10.2307/2296714"", ""10.2307/1055766"", ""10.3386/w25197"", ""10.1016/0014-4983(75)90021-2""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The effect of its hypothesized amalgamation is generally ignored in mantle convection models claiming the transition from Rodinia to Pangaea represents a single supercontinent cycle. We apply three geodynamic scenarios to Pannotia amalgamation that are tested using regional geology. Scenarios involving quasi-stationary mantle convection patterns are not supported by the geological record. A scenario involving feedback between the supercontinent cycle and global mantle convection patterns predicts upwellings beneath the Gondwanan portion of Pannotia and the arrival of plumes along the entire Gondwanan (but not Laurentian) margin beginning at c. 0.6 Ga. Such a scenario is compatible with regional geology, but the candidates for plume magmatism we propose require testing by detailed geochemical and isotopic studies. If verified, this scenario could provide geodynamic explanations for the origins of the late Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic Iapetus and Rheic oceans and the terranes that were repeatedly detached from their margins.","[{""name"": ""J.

Besides providing an overview of the state of the art in automatic software verification, the goal of the competition is to establish standards, provide a platform for exchange to developers of such tools, educate PhD students on reproducibility approaches and benchmarking, and provide computing resources to developers that do not have access to compute clusters. The competition consisted of 23 805 verification tasks for C programs and 586 verification tasks for Java programs. The specifications include reachability, memory safety, overflows, and termination. This year, the competition introduced a new competition track on witness validation, where validators for verification witnesses are evaluated with respect to their quality.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_27"", ""10.1109/ASE.2019.00121"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_33"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_25"", ""10.1134/S0361768820080022"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_38"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_43"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_55"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-71500-7_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7627787"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30826-0_17"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7627783"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7627791"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7627829"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950351"", ""10.1145/2786805.2786867"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92994-1_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99524-9_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99429-7_3"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7635975"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-22308-2_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-48288-9_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_22"", ""10.1145/2049697.2049700"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94111-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24730-2_15"", ""10.1145/1985793.1985839"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-33826-7_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_41"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48869-1_5"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00619-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-27940-9_13"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2010.05812"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_36"", ""10.1145/3519939.3523727"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_15"", ""10.1007/s10009-015-0407-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_19"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2303.06477"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66706-5_7"", ""10.1007/s10817-019-09535-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49052-6"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00617-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_35"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_29"", ""10.1145/3478536"", ""10.1145/3332466.3374529"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41600-3_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_35"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02508-3_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_31"", ""10.23919/DATE54114.2022.9774672"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_37"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_27"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_44"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_24"", ""10.1145/1889997.1890000"", ""10.1007/s10515-013-0122-2"", ""10.1007/s10515-020-00270-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_34"", ""10.5281/zenodo.6147218"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_29"", ""10.1145/3368089.3409734"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_38"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2017.8102257"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_23"", ""10.1145/2970276.2970337"", ""10.15514/ISPRAS-2017-29(4)-13"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7612021"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_36"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_3""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

Voting data from a thousand districts and a hundred cities for four elections between 1930 and 1933 show that areas more affected by austerity (spending cuts and tax increases) had relatively higher vote shares for the Nazi Party. We also find that the localities with relatively high austerity experienced relatively high suffering (measured by mortality rates) and these areas’ electorates were more likely to vote for the Nazi Party. Our findings are robust to a range of specifications including an instrumental variable strategy and a border-pair policy discontinuity design.,"[{""name"": ""Gregori Galofré-Vilà"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher M.

These include remains of organisms within the size range of pollen grains ( c. 10–250 µm), resistant to laboratory treatments used for the preparation of palynological samples. NPPs are a large and taxonomically heterogeneous group of remains of organisms living in diverse environments. Taxonomically, they belong to a wide variety of groups such as cyanobacteria, algae, vascular plants, invertebrates and fungi. The aim of this chapter is to provide a general overview of NPP groups observed in palynology slides. It includes more than 40 of the most common groups starting with acritarcha, cyanobacteria and algae, moving through transitional groups to animals and fungi and finishing with human-made objects such as textile fibres. Although far from complete, it provides an updated overview of taxonomical diversity of NPPs and their indicator values. Further works on NPP identifications are of great importance to improve our current knowledge. Since NPPs occur in all kinds of sediments, their analysis is a powerful tool for reconstructing environmental changes over time. Further detailed studies of specific NPP groups and their indicator values will open the way for new fields of study.","[{""name"": ""Lyudmila Shumilovskikh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Palynology and Climate Dynamics, Georg-August-University Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany"", ""Research Laboratory ‘Herbarium’, National Research Tomsk State University, Tomsk, Russia""]}, {""name"": ""Jennifer M.

Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) can provide global, precise, and continuous positioning in open-sky environments. However, urban environments with frequent outliers and cycle slips degrade the traditional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) positioning performance. The susceptibility of EKF to outliers is attributed to its inherent structure. To mitigate, the GNSS positioning based on the Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) structure is adopted. FGO can enhance time correlation among observations and enable the updating of historical information, thereby improving resistance against outliers. In this study, we proposed a single-differenced GNSS-FGO model instead of the double-differenced model to preserve the sparsity of FGO, and outlier detection and PAR methods are employed to ensure urban positioning performance. To evaluate the proposed structure, experiments are conducted in both urban and open-sky environments. The results demonstrate the improvement of positioning accuracy and reliability, compared to EKF.","[{""name"": ""Y. Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F.

10.1111/ehr.13105,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,"Beyond the male breadwinner: Life-cycle living standards of intact and disrupted English working families, 1260-1850","AbstractThis article provides a novel framework within which to evaluate real household incomes of predominantly rural working families of various sizes and structures in England in the years 1260–1850. We reject ahistorical assumptions about complete reliance on men's wages and male breadwinning, moving closer to reality by including women and children's contributions to family incomes. Our empirical strategy benefits from recent estimates of men's annual earnings, so avoiding the need to gross up day rates using problematic assumptions about days worked, and from new data on women and children's wages and labour inputs. A family life‐cycle approach which accommodates consumption smoothing through saving adds further breadth and realism. Moreover, the analysis embraces two historically common but often overlooked family types alternative to the traditional male‐breadwinner model: one where the husband is missing having died or deserted, and one where the husband is present but unwilling or unable to find work. Our framework suggests living standards varied widely by family structure and dependency ratio. Incorporating detailed demographic data available for 1560 onward suggests that small and intact families enjoyed high and rising living standards after 1700, while large or disrupted families depended on child labour and poor relief untilc. 1830. A broader perspective on family structures informs understanding of the chronology and nature of poverty and coping strategies.","[{""name"": ""Sara Horrell"", ""affiliation"": [""London School of Economics""]}, {""name"": ""Jane Humphries"", ""affiliation"": [""All Souls College, Oxford and London School of Economics""]}, {""name"": ""Jacob Weisdorf"", ""affiliation"": [""Sapienza University of Rome, CAGE, CEPR""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511816680"", ""10.1111/ehr.12079"", ""10.1111/ehr.12661"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00566.x"", ""10.1080/03071028708567670"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495670"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00089"", ""10.1093/ereh/het009"", ""10.1017/S0268416019000328"", ""10.1093/hwj/35.1.22"", ""10.2307/2598224"", ""10.1017/S136149161100013X"", ""10.1111/ehr.12997"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511528590"", ""10.1017/S0022050700022282"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2004.00292.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139031110"", ""10.1007/s13524-017-0556-4"", ""10.1177/036319908200700401"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2006.00358.x"", ""10.1017/S0022050700021197"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139167697"", ""10.1093/pastj/gts016"", ""10.1017/S0022050700021100"", ""10.1007/s001480050048"", ""10.1080/03585522.2013.861768"", ""10.1111/j.2397-2335.1942.tb04540.x"", ""10.1017/S0022050700011931"", ""10.2307/2597872"", ""10.1006/exeh.1995.1021"", ""10.1017/S0020859000114786"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2019.04.001"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtaa005"", ""10.3828/lhr.63.1.31"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511780455"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2012.00651.x"", ""10.1017/S0268416020000247"", ""10.1111/ehr.12693"", ""10.1017/S0022050715000662"", ""10.1093/ej/uez017"", ""10.1017/9781108560535"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-25260-2_8"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00159"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511896002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511560675"", ""10.1515/9781787441378-007"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511561207.003"", ""10.1017/S1361491698000069"", ""10.1093/ereh/het005"", ""10.1515/9781782049944"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511933905"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00588.x"", ""10.1007/s11698-016-0140-y"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2012.08.001"", ""10.1017/CHO9781139815017.003"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199600793.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00533.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511599446"", ""10.1179/004049602793710107"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818196"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2005.00311.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511660344"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190847883.001.0001""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"
10.1017/S0963926820000206,URBAN HISTORY,0603 World History,Mapping spatial cultures: contributions of space syntax to research in the urban history of the nineteenth-century city,"AbstractThe theory and methods of space syntax can help to rebalance the prevailing cultural perspective, which views maps as ideological representations, with an analytical approach that emphasizes maps as sources for understanding space and spatial relationships embedded in built forms. The quantitative descriptions of urban street networks produced by space syntax analyses can be used to formulate and test hypotheses about patterns of urban movement, encounter and socio-economic activity in the past that can help in the interpretation of other historical source materials to give an overall account of urban spatial culture. In this article, the authors explain how space syntax, a theory and method originally developed in the field of architectural research, is making a distinctive contribution to research in social and urban history. The key principles of the method are explained by clarifying the relationship of space syntax to HGIS (Historical Geographical Information Systems) and through a worked example of research undertaken into political meeting places. A survey of research into the urban history of the nineteenth-century city using space syntax is used to highlight a number of important methodological themes and also demonstrates the range of innovative contributions that this interdisciplinary approach is able to advance. A final, theoretical, section reflects on maps and the practice of ‘mapping’ from a space syntax perspective.","[{""name"": ""Sam Griffiths"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Vaughan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9781315610269"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511597237"", ""10.7202/1051383ar"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4762.2005.00651.x"", ""10.51347/jum.v14i2.3955"", ""10.1111/hith.10676"", ""10.1068/b030147"", ""10.1080/13555502.2017.1301179"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511493645"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-00993-3"", ""10.1080/1600910X.2016.1183219"", ""10.2307/621837"", ""10.1215/01642472-3315826"", ""10.2747/0272-3638.31.1.29"", ""10.1080/00420980500535146"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511814563"", ""10.2307/j.ctvqhspn"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1g69z0m.16"", ""10.4324/9781315167046-7"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-5009-8_11"", ""10.51347/jum.v14i1.4200"", ""10.7765/9781784996895"", ""10.2307/j.ctv550dcj""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Building and Construction', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

We propose that this body greatly conditioned the structural domains of the Cantabrian–Pyrenean fold-and-thrust belt during their evolution from hyperextension in Early Cretaceous times to shortening and inversion during the Cenozoic. This may be seen as a new line for cross-section construction and balancing, because previous cross-sections do not incorporate comparable volumes of exhumed mantle. Five structural cross-sections, constrained by the results of 3D gravity inversion, feed our discussion of the complexities of the doubly vergent Pyrenean orogen in view of the inversion of a precursor hyperextended rifted margin. In all sections, crustal rocks underthrust the lithospheric mantle in the hyperextended region, supporting that the near-surface exhumed mantle lithosphere acts as a more rigid buttress, allowing weaker continental material to be expelled outwards and upwards by thrusting during the Alpine collision; thus giving rise to two uplifted crustal triangular zones at the boundaries with the exhumed mantle. Contractional slip is localized in lithospheric-scale thrusts, which in turn reactivate parts of the extensional system. The NE–SW transfer zones that offset the rift therefore behave as compartmental faults during the orogenic phase. The amount of shortening increases from 34 km in the Cantabrian Cordillera, where the Basque–Cantabrian Basin partially preserves its original extensional geometry, to 135 km in the nappe stack of the central Pyrenees.","[{""name"": ""Jesús García-Senz"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Antonio Pedrera"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Conxi Ayala"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain"", ""Present address: Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera (IJCJA-CSIC), Carrer Lluís Solé i Sabaris s/n, 08028 Barcelona, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Ana Ruiz-Constán"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Alejandro Robador"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Luis Roberto Rodríguez-Fernández"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511524851.031"", ""10.1002/2017TC004670"", ""10.1080/17445647.2015.1126538"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.S7-XVIII.6.1725"", ""10.1002/2015TC004019"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024<0675:MMFSCT>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1029/1999JB900390"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.VI.2.251"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(86)90254-4"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(80)90166-1"", ""10.1306/M46497C23"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2004.02.013"", ""10.1111/bre.12187"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-809417-4.00019-7"", ""10.3989/egeol.85415-6720"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2012.04.018"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2015.07.009"", ""10.1007/s00531-015-1177-z"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(97)00087-3"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(96)00123-9"", ""10.1130/GES01363.1"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-27889-x"", ""10.1146/annurev.ea.20.050192.001043"", ""10.1029/TC008i001p00023"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(73)90041-1"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.2003.208.01.11"", ""10.1002/2013TC003471"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1993)105<0715:LBACOS>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1029/TC008i005p01051"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-78849-9_15"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.VI.2.273"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.VI.2.287"", ""10.1002/2014TC003816"", ""10.1038/331508a0"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(2001)029<1023:SOSSPI>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1029/1999JB900321"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2010.06.020"", ""10.1016/B978-044452748-6/00097-3"", ""10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2015.10.020"", ""10.1029/2008TC002406"", ""10.1029/2010GC003218"", ""10.1306/12090909116"", ""10.1111/ter.12087"", ""10.1029/2009TC002588"", ""10.1144/jgs2016-002"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1999)111<1808:COTGOF>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2015.06.017"", ""10.1007/s00531-002-0283-x"", ""10.1007/s00531-014-1023-8"", ""10.1130/G20565.1"", ""10.1111/ter.12104"", ""10.2973/dsdp.proc.48.154.1979"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-3066-0_21"", ""10.1016/0191-8141(86)90058-1"", ""10.1111/ter.12240"", ""10.1029/2001JB000549"", ""10.1029/2001JB001667"", ""10.1029/2007JB005021"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2015.04.018"", ""10.1002/2017TC004716"", ""10.1029/2018TC005222"", ""10.1111/j.1365-246X.1995.tb06436.x"", ""10.1080/17445647.2015.1084545"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-3066-0_22"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(96)00114-X"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2015.08.046"", ""10.1038/nature09520"", ""10.1029/2010TC002735"", ""10.1016/j.crte.2015.12.005"", ""10.1029/TC008i001p00041"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2017.07.008"", ""10.1029/2003JB002514"", ""10.1029/2005JB003856"", ""10.1144/0016-76492010-072"", ""10.1029/JZ064i001p00049"", ""10.1002/tect.20019"", ""10.1144/gsjgs.153.2.0301"", ""10.1029/98TC00561"", ""10.1016/j.crte.2015.10.010"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2018.01.009"", ""10.1016/0031-9201(90)90082-9"", ""10.1002/2014TC003529"", ""10.1046/j.0956-540x.2001.01393.x"", ""10.1016/0264-8172(95)98854-X"", ""10.1306/M46497C9"", ""10.4095/208180"", ""10.1130/G37812.1"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(75)90151-X"", ""10.1190/1.1442298"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-809417-4.00017-3""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],['Geophysics'],"[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"

Non-planarity of faults can be caused by variations in failure modes, which in turn are dictated by mechanical stratigraphy interacting with the ambient stress field, as well as by linkage of fault segments. Different portions of a fault or fault zone may experience volume gain, volume conservation and volume loss simultaneously depending on the position along a fault's surface, the stresses resolved on the fault and the associated deformation mechanisms. This variation in deformation style and associated volume change has a profound effect on the ability of a fault to transmit (or impede) fluid both along and across the fault. In this paper we explore interrelated concepts of failure mode and resolved stress analysis, and provide examples of fault geometry in normal faulting and reverse faulting stress regimes that illustrate the effects of fault geometry on failure behaviour and related importance to fluid transmission.

Meanwhile, although Constrained Horn Clauses ($$\mathrm {CHCs}$$ CHCs ) empower a wide range of verification techniques and tools, they lack the ability to express hyperproperties beyond k-safety such as generalized non-interference and co-termination.This paper describes a novel and fully automated constraint-based approach to relational verification. We first introduce a new class of predicate Constraint Satisfaction Problems called $$\mathrm {pfwCSP}$$ pfwCSP where constraints are represented as clauses modulo first-order theories over predicate variables of three kinds: ordinary, well-founded, or functional. This generalization over $$\mathrm {CHCs}$$ CHCs permits arbitrary (i.e., possibly non-Horn) clauses, well-foundedness constraints, functionality constraints, and is capable of expressing these relational verification problems. Our approach enables us to express and automatically verify problem instances that require non-trivial (i.e., non-sequential and non-lock-step) self-composition by automatically inferring appropriate schedulers (or alignment) that dictate when and which program copies move. To solve problems in this new language, we present a constraint solving method for $$\mathrm {pfwCSP}$$ pfwCSP based on stratified CounterExample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) of ordinary, well-founded, and functional predicates.We have implemented the proposed framework and obtained promising results on diverse relational verification problems that are beyond the scope of the previous verification frameworks.","[{""name"": ""Hiroshi Unno"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tachio Terauchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eric Koskinen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0956796819000145"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15769-1_8"", ""10.1145/3062341.3062378"", ""10.1145/2678015.2682546"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009889"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-21437-0_17"", ""10.1145/964001.964003"", ""10.1109/CSF.2007.30"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_61"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-23534-9_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_20"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314596"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_15"", ""10.1109/CSF.2008.7"", ""10.1145/3371070"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-32004-3_20"", ""10.1145/3324783"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_5"", ""10.1145/2837614.2837664"", ""10.1145/2737924.2737976"", ""10.1145/2254064.2254112"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38574-2_20"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8603013"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_38"", ""10.1007/11691372_33"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_19"", ""10.1145/1993498.1993525"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_2"", ""10.2168/LMCS-11(1:16)2015"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/11863908_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61470-6_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_17"", ""10.1145/2908080.2908099"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-37036-6_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38856-9_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_9"", ""10.1145/1168857.1168907"", ""10.1145/2908080.2908092"", ""10.1145/1706299.1706315"", ""10.1007/11547662_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46669-8_25"", ""10.1145/1599410.1599445"", ""10.1145/1134744.1134750"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38856-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-68237-0_5"", ""10.1145/3192366.3192416"", ""10.1145/2784731.2784766""]","['Chemistry', 'Computer Science']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Organic Chemistry']","[[('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0703 化学', 0.7525), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7384)]]"

10.1108/HESWBL-01-2019-0009,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,"Student's entrepreneurial orientation and intentions A study across gender, academic background, and regions","PurposeThis study is aimed to measure and understand the relationship between individual entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) and entrepreneurial intention (EI) among students of higher learning institutions (HLI’s) in India. This study is focused on understanding IEO dimension of proactiveness, innovativeness and risk-taking attitude and EI across gender, academic background, and regions. Many recent and past studies confirm that there is an apparent gap in the literature to understand this phenomenon among students of higher learning institutions.Design/methodology/approachThe study is based on a sample of 393 students studying in 35 different universities and institutions in the North, South and Western regions of India. The data were analyzed using hierarchical regression and ANOVA.FindingsThe empirical result shows a relationship and a positive impact of individual entrepreneurial orientation dimensions upon entrepreneurial intentions. Controlling for gender, males depict higher perseverance toward individual entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial intentions. The same result was found for management and entrepreneurship students who also depict a higher (mean)t-value than science, engineering students. The findings of this study reveal a significant contribution to the academic literature by highlighting the influencing role of gender, academic background, and region upon entrepreneurial intentions.Practical implicationsThe study reveals that institutional culture, lack of academic rigor, regional difference, economic gaps, gender perception, and overall culture may be considered as bothering forces for entrepreneurship to grow via institutions. These forces, if eliminated, can help build an institutional environment helpful for entrepreneurial progression in the country.Originality/valueThere are limited studies available in the context of individual entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial Intention relationship. This study provides the analysis for Indian regions and uses data collected from different universities and institutions of India.","[{""name"": ""Sumit Kumar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zahoor Ahmad Paray"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amit Kumar Dwivedi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/mgr0000035"", ""10.1108/17506200810897231"", ""10.1007/s10843-015-0144-x"", ""10.1108/00400911011050945"", ""10.1007/s11365-013-0278-z"", ""10.1108/JMP-07-2014-0213"", ""10.1186/s40497-016-0057-8"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.03.181"", ""10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00033-0"", ""10.1108/17561391011019023"", ""10.1108/00400911211210314"", ""10.1080/08985620903233929"", ""10.5465/amr.1996.9602161568"", ""10.1108/IJIS-07-2017-0067"", ""10.1108/IJIS-07-2017-0067"", ""10.1108/JEC-12-2016-0046"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.07.005"", ""10.1111/j.1540-627X.2008.00257.x"", ""10.1108/ET-06-2015-0044"", ""10.1108/00400911211274864"", ""10.1108/03090590910939049"", ""10.1108/14626000810917843"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.09.093"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.01.001"", ""10.1108/ET-02-2016-0024"", ""10.1002/smj.4250100107"", ""10.1016/0883-9026(90)90004-D"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2006.00110.x"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.11.024"", ""10.1108/IJGE-08-2016-0028"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00396.x"", ""10.1007/s11365-015-0356-5"", ""10.1287/mnsc.29.7.770"", ""10.2307/41164491"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2008.00238.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2007.00223.x"", ""10.1177/0971355713490621"", ""10.1002/smj.360""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"

A lifelong learning mindset is a way of approaching one's work with curiosity, strategic thinking, and resilience. Career success refers to objective (e.g., number of promotions) and subjective (e.g., job satisfaction) indicators of progress and fulfillment in one's work.Design/methodology/approachTwo studies are presented. Both studies draw from an accounting and finance program at a Canadian university. In study 1, data were collected from students (n = 62) and their supervisors at the end of a four-month co-operative education (co-op) work term. In study 2, data were collected from graduates (n = 148).FindingsResults suggest that developing a lifelong learning mindset enhances both objective and subjective career success. Participants' lifelong learning mindset was associated with objective career success in both studies (supervisor-rated performance in study 1 and number of promotions in study 2). Lifelong learning mindset was associated with subjective career success in study 2 (job satisfaction, work engagement, and job-related self-efficacy) but not in study 1 (experience satisfaction).Originality/valueThis article presents the first empirical examination of the relationship between a lifelong learning mindset and career success. Insights from the article highlight the fact that educators and workplace managers might work together to promote a lifelong learning mindset for current and future workers.","[{""name"": ""David W.

10.1093/pastj/gtaa022,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,HEATHROW AND THE MAKING OF NEOLIBERAL BRITAIN,"Abstract How might we understand neoliberalism and its history differently if we trace its emergence and operation in a particular place? As the first airport in the world to be privatized in 1986 Heathrow is a paradigmatic neoliberal space. And yet for decades before it was sold the airport’s services — catering, cleaning, retail and security — had been steadily deregulated and outsourced in ways that force us to reconsider neoliberalism as discrete from, or emerging from a rupture with, welfare capitalism. The precarious and cheap outsourced forms of labour at Heathrow were performed by Commonwealth citizens of colour, often women, who had paradoxically arrived in Britain through an increasingly hostile immigration regime at the airport. The racialized forms of neoliberal capitalism at the airport depended upon and reproduced a post-imperial social formation that was no less marked by postcolonial crises and a new biopolitics of immigration control designed to restrict their diasporas in the metropole. Seen from Heathrow, neoliberalism is less about the global flow of ideas and capital than the local social formations and labour regimes engendered by changing forms of accumulation.","[{""name"": ""James Vernon"", ""affiliation"": [""University of California, Berkeley""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We present the first submarine landslide database for the eastern margin of New Zealand comprising &gt;2200 landslides occurring in water depths from c. 300–4000 m. Landslides are more prevalent and, on average, larger on the active margin compared with the passive margin. We attribute higher concentrations of landslides on the active margin to tectonic processes including uplift and oversteepening, faulting and seamount subduction. Submarine landslide scars are concentrated around canyon systems and close to canyon thalwegs. This suggests that not only does mass wasting play a major role in canyon evolution, but also that canyon-forming processes may provide preconditioning factors for slope failure. Results of this study offer unique insights into the spatial distribution, magnitude and morphology of submarine landslides across different geological settings, providing a better understanding of the causative factors for mass wasting in New Zealand and around the world.","[{""name"": ""S.

Also, it was found that entrepreneurial culture has a positive effect on university environment, and the latter has a positive effect on entrepreneurial training.Research limitations/implicationsThe main limitation of this study was that only ten Colombian universities were sampled; therefore, general inferences cannot be made. Additionally, the variables investigated here may have not accurately measured the full scale of the entrepreneurship programmes in such universities or the way the culture of these institutions had a direct impact on students. Projects such as the Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students' Survey (GUESSS), which measure variables related to entrepreneurship at the university level, enable universities to shape their policies around this important topic. This study indicates that universities should offer training in entrepreneurial, problem-solving and communication skills to produce entrepreneurs who can better face current challenges.Originality/valueOther studies have discussed entrepreneurial culture, but they usually deal with university environment, entrepreneurial training and entrepreneurial attitudes separately. This study integrates all these factors and measures the level of interaction between them.","[{""name"": ""Alejandro Valencia-Arias"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Diana Arango-Botero"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Javier A.

This study compares four machine-learning algorithms comprising of Classification And Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification of urban land-use and land-cover (LULC) features. Using multitemporal and multisensor Landsat data from 1984-2020 at 5-year intervals for the Greater Gaborone Planning Area (GGPA) in Botswana, the aim of the study is to determine the performance of the classifiers in the extraction of different urban LULC features as built-up, bare-soil, water, grass, shrubs and forest. The results show that for mapping built-up areas, RF and SVM presented the best results with overall accuracy of 85%. Bare soil is best mapped using RF and CART with accuracy of up to 98%, while SVM and GTB were most suitable for mapping water bodies. The suitable classifiers for mapping the vegetation classes were RF for grass (94.5%), SVM for shrubland (81.5%) and GTB for forest (84.3%). In terms of class specific accuracy, RF achieved the highest performance with average overall accuracy (OA) of 95.9%, SVM (95.8%), GTB (95.6%) and CART (95.1%). The same performance pattern was observed from the F1-score, True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR) and Area under ROC curve (AUC) metrices for the class classification accuracies. The overall accuracy for the eight-epoch years were RF (87.8%), SVM (87.5%), GTB (86.4%) and CART (85.3%). To improve on the urban LULC mapping, the study proposes the post-classification feature fusion of the best classifier results.","[{""name"": ""Y. Ouma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""B.

Recent integration of LiDAR into smartphones opens up a whole new world of possibilities for 3D indoor/outdoor mapping. Although these new systems offer an unprecedent opportunity for the democratization in the use of scanning technology, data quality is lower than data captured from high-end LiDAR sensors. This paper is focused on discussing the capability of recent Apple smart devices for applications related with 3D mapping of indoor and outdoor environments. Indoor scenes are evaluated from a reconstruction perspective, and three geometric aspects (local precision, global correctness, and surface coverage) are considered using data captured in two adjacent rooms. Outdoor environments are analysed from a mobility point of view, and elements defining the physical accessibility in building entrances are considered for evaluation.","[{""name"": ""L.

10.1111/ehr.13045,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,"Two worlds of female labour: gender wage inequality in western Europe, 1300-1800<SUP>†</SUP>","AbstractLabour market engagement by women is an important determinant of female autonomy that may also affect their demographic behaviour. In order to bring about the conditions for the female autonomy that characterized the European marriage pattern (in which women had a say in the decision about when and whom they marry), women needed to earn a decent wage. This is clearly affected by the gender wage ratio and the possibility of women earning their own living and having the option of remaining single. So far no attempt has been made to compare the wages of women across Europe over the long run. In this article we provide evidence on the wages of unskilled women for seven European countries (represented by cities or regions within these countries) between 1300 and 1800. Our evidence shows that there were two worlds of female labour. In the south of Europe women earned about 50 per cent of the wage of unskilled male labourers, a ratio that seems to have been fixed by custom. In the northern and western parts of Europe this ratio was much higher during late medieval period, but it showed a declining trend between about 1500 and 1800, a change that was caused by market forces.","[{""name"": ""Alexandra de Pleijt"", ""affiliation"": [""Utrecht University""]}, {""name"": ""Jan Luiten van Zanden"", ""affiliation"": [""Utrecht University""]}]","[""10.1006/exeh.2001.0775"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2003.00257.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511816680"", ""10.1111/ehr.12079"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00566.x"", ""10.35948/0557-1359/1977.873"", ""10.1093/past/165.1.3"", ""10.1093/past/173.1.199"", ""10.2307/3180153"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195073904.001.0001"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtq032"", ""10.1093/hwj/35.1.22"", ""10.1080/00140138708969760"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.12032"", ""10.1080/20780389.2017.1372186"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00054"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2004.00292.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495779"", ""10.2478/v10237-012-0015-5"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2006.00358.x"", ""10.1484/M.HAMA-EB.5.103309"", ""10.1257/aer.103.3.545"", ""10.1017/S0022050720000145"", ""10.1017/S0268416008006772"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00648.x"", ""10.1257/jep.29.4.227"", ""10.2307/j.ctvcm4h7m"", ""10.1257/aer.90.4.806"", ""10.1179/007817286790616552"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198201540.001.0001"", ""10.1093/past/173.1.191"", ""10.2307/2597872"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2012.00663.x"", ""10.1111/ehr.12693"", ""10.1017/S0022050715000662"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511896002"", ""10.1515/9781846159886-007"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00483.x"", ""10.3917/rfas.en605.0073"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00500.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198205548.001.0001"", ""10.1524/jbwg.2004.45.2.25"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628672.011"", ""10.1093/ereh/hew013"", ""10.1111/1468-0424.00210"", ""10.1093/hwj/7.1.3"", ""10.1111/ehr.12733"", ""10.1080/13545701.2012.734630"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511599446"", ""10.1257/aer.103.6.2227"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000396"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004175174.i-346"", ""10.1016/j.hisfam.2011.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2011.11.002""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'History']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

The present article gives a concise overview of approaches and methods within digital historical scholarship, focusing on the question ‘How have the digital humanities evolved and what has that evolution brought to historical scholarship?’ We begin by discussing techniques in which data are generated and machine searchable, such as OCR/HTR, born‐digital archives, computer vision, scholarly editions and linked data. In the second section, we provide examples of how data is made more accessible through quantitative text and network analysis. The third section considers the need for hermeneutics and data‐awareness in digital historical scholarship. The technologies described in this article have had varying degrees of effect on historical scholarship, usually in indirect ways. With this article we aim to take stock of the digital approaches and methods used in historical scholarship in order to provide starting points for scholars seeking to understand the digital turn in the field and how and when to implement such approaches in their work.","[{""name"": ""C.

10.1111/ehr.12877,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Can school centralization foster human capital accumulation? A quasi-experiment from early twentieth-century Italy,"AbstractThis article shows that a shift towards a more centralized school system can benefit countries that are characterized by poor levels of human capital and large regional disparities in education. In 1911, Italy moved from a fully decentralized primary school system towards centralization through the Daneo‐Credaro Reform. The design of the Reform allows us to compare treated municipalities with those that retained school autonomy. Our quasi‐experiment, based on propensity score matching (PSM), shows that centralization substantially increased the pace of human capital accumulation. Treated municipalities were characterized by a 0.43 percentage‐point premium on the average annual growth of literacy between 1911 and 1921. We discuss some of the channels through which the new legislation affected primary schooling and literacy, with important implications for long‐term economic growth.","[{""name"": ""Gabriele Cappelli"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Siena and University of Barcelona""]}, {""name"": ""Michelangelo Vasta"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Siena""]}]","[""10.1257/aer.102.5.1832"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199944590.003.0006"", ""10.1111/ehr.12738"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2017.12.003"", ""10.1111/ehr.12332"", ""10.1177/0895904891005004003"", ""10.1093/ereh/hev020"", ""10.1007/s11698-015-0133-2"", ""10.1111/ehr.12078"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2017.08.002"", ""10.1007/s10887-017-9141-3"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2018.07.003"", ""10.3386/w9259"", ""10.4337/9781849806565.00016"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000712"", ""10.1093/ereh/heu018"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226078854.003.0006"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-40406-1_23"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2012.08.002"", ""10.1007/s10887-012-9081-x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6419.2010.00633.x"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.04.007"", ""10.18235/0008567"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510724"", ""10.1016/0304-3932(88)90168-7"", ""10.2307/2596346"", ""10.1086/600102"", ""10.1093/ereh/hex006"", ""10.1086/261725"", ""10.1093/biomet/70.1.41"", ""10.1111/ehr.12101"", ""10.2307/1884513"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.04.006"", ""10.18356/7007ef44-en""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The approach is underpinned by an inductive framework: this is structured as a sequential loop between a learner, which manipulates a candidate BC structured as a neural network, and a sound verifier, which either certifies the candidate’s validity or generates counter-examples to further guide the learner. We compare the approach against state-of-the-art techniques, over polynomial and non-polynomial dynamical models: the outcomes show that we can synthesise sound BCs up to two orders of magnitude faster, with in particular a stark speedup on the verification engine (up to three orders less), whilst needing a far smaller data set (up to three orders less) for the learning part. Beyond improvements over the state of the art, we further challenge the new approach on a hybrid dynamical model and on larger-dimensional models, and showcase the numerical robustness of our algorithms and codebase.","[{""name"": ""Andrea Peruffo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniele Ahmed"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alessandro Abate"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/LCSYS.2020.3005328"", ""10.1109/LCSYS.2020.3005328"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_15"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2009.02.028"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_6"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2012.6225351"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.11.154"", ""10.1007/s10817-020-09562-z"", ""10.1016/j.jsc.2016.07.010"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31365-3_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38574-2_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-50497-0"", ""10.1016/j.nahs.2020.100858"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-19249-9_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-70545-1_17"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2005.08.007"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24743-2_32"", ""10.1109/TAC.2007.902736"", ""10.1109/CDC.2015.7402879"", ""10.1145/2968478.2968485"", ""10.15607/RSS.2017.XIII.049"", ""10.3182/20130904-3-FR-2041.00198"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95582-7_25"", ""10.1145/1168857.1168907"", ""10.1109/TRO.2017.2659727"", ""10.1145/2968478.2968484"", ""10.1145/3365365.3382222""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

The need for a reproducible method of thermal maturity assessment by means of Raman spectroscopic analyses on the organic matter is essential for the development of this technique as a robust support in organic petrographical analyses. The new method was tested on concentrated kerogen derived from a set of 33 samples that originated from cuttings from a 5000 m-thick section drilled in offshore Angola. The proposed method can be applied separately in the D and G bands regions of the Raman spectra, and uses a fitting approach based on asymmetrical Gaussian deconvolution and on the measurement of the integrated area. Results from this work demonstrate that Raman parameters carried out by the new methods reflect the increase in aromaticity in kerogen in diagenesis. Finally, two parametric equations have been proposed to correlate Raman parameters and thermal maturity: the first is for the thermal maturity interval between 0.3 and 1.5% R o ; and the second has a higher precision of between 1.0 and 1.5% R o . The two equations are the result of a multi-linear regression based on robust correlations between Raman parameters and vitrinite reflectance (R o %).","[{""name"": ""Andrea Schito"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sveva Corrado"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1046/j.1525-1314.2002.00408.x"", ""10.1016/S1386-1425(03)00070-2"", ""10.1016/j.vibspec.2016.08.014"", ""10.1098/rsta.2004.1448"", ""10.1016/j.chemphys.2004.02.018"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2016.07.039"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.61.14095"", ""10.1016/0016-2361(72)90079-8"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2010.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2018.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2014.10.013"", ""10.1016/j.saa.2008.09.006"", ""10.1111/j.1365-3121.2010.00956.x"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2007.01.008"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2015.11.010"", ""10.3389/fenrg.2017.00024"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2008.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2016.05.002"", ""10.1021/jp0128473"", ""10.1063/1.1710853"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.20.392"", ""10.1039/B613962K"", ""10.1002/jrs.2636"", ""10.1016/S0022-3093(98)00349-4"", ""10.1016/j.saa.2005.02.015"", ""10.1039/C5CP06519D"", ""10.1098/rsta.2004.1454"", ""10.1016/0146-6380(93)90042-A"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2005.02.018"", ""10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00221-5"", ""10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2016.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.orggeochem.2016.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2017.02.003"", ""10.1295/polymj.4.460"", ""10.1016/0146-6380(86)90055-0"", ""10.1063/1.1674108"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2014.03.006"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1314.1996.05792.x"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2013.10.013""]","['Materials Science', 'Chemical Engineering']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Catalysis']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.761), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7487), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7377), ('0703 化学', 0.7365), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7354)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7169), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7168)]]"

Its prevalence has had a powerful impact in healthcare, with numerous applications and intelligent systems achieving clinical level expertise. However, building robust and generalizable systems relies on training algorithms in a centralized fashion using large, heterogeneous datasets. In medicine, these datasets are time consuming to annotate and difficult to collect centrally due to privacy concerns. Recently, Federated Learning has been proposed as a distributed learning technique to alleviate many of these privacy concerns by providing a decentralized training paradigm for models using large, distributed data. This new approach has become the defacto way of building machine learning models in multiple industries (e.g. edge computing, smartphones). Due to its strong potential, Federated Learning is also becoming a popular training method in healthcare, where patient privacy is of paramount concern. In this paper we performed an extensive literature review to identify state-of-the-art Federated Learning applications for cancer research and clinical oncology analysis. Our objective is to provide readers with an overview of the evolving Federated Learning landscape, with a focus on applications and algorithms in oncology space. Moreover, we hope that this review will help readers to identify potential needs and future directions for research and development.","[{""name"": ""Alexander Chowdhury"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hasan Kassem"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicolas Padoy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Renato Umeton"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexandros Karargyris"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298594"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.90"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-24797-2"", ""10.1007/s12194-017-0406-5"", ""10.2741/4725"", ""10.1007/s10278-017-0009-z"", ""10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocy017"", ""10.1038/s41597-019-0322-0"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.3301590"", ""10.3390/informatics8030059"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.226"", ""10.1038/s41746-020-00323-1"", ""10.2200/S00960ED2V01Y201910AIM043"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2020.106854"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61609-0_60"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-11723-8_9"", ""10.1038/s41598-020-69250-1"", ""10.1093/neuonc/noz175.737"", ""10.1007/s11060-017-2420-1"", ""10.1109/TMI.2014.2377694"", ""10.1109/TII.2021.3093715"", ""10.3390/app11052145"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-60548-3_18"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocaa341"", ""10.1016/j.radonc.2019.11.019"", ""10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363547"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.310"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-60548-3_19"", ""10.3748/wjg.v24.i43.4846"", ""10.2196/25869"", ""10.1016/j.radonc.2021.03.013"", ""10.1186/s13059-021-02553-2"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1972.tb00899.x"", ""10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00245"", ""10.21203/rs.3.rs-722389/v1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-60548-3_13"", ""10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9434078"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-87199-4_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-87199-4_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-87199-4_32"", ""10.1038/sdata.2018.161"", ""10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.01387"", ""10.1109/JBHI.2022.3185956"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-60548-3_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-52705-1_35"", ""10.1016/S0020-7373(86)80040-2"", ""10.14778/3494124.3494125"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-50420-5_31"", ""10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9413927"", ""10.1038/s41598-020-77476-2"", ""10.1109/CLOUD55607.2022.00076"", ""10.1109/IWCMC51323.2021.9498820"", ""10.1200/CCI.20.00045"", ""10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006173"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-63076-8_2"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107872"", ""10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.07.234"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-32692-0_16"", ""10.1101/2021.02.24.432489"", ""10.1109/TCBB.2018.2829760"", ""10.1145/3462203.3475875"", ""10.2478/popets-2021-0041"", ""10.21203/rs.3.rs-1478332/v1"", ""10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00081"", ""10.14722/ndss.2021.24434"", ""10.1007/s11433-021-1753-3""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Advances in visual technologies--daguerreotypes, lithographs, cartes de visite, and steam printing presses--enabled people to see and participate in social reform movements in new ways. African American activists seized these opportunities and produced images that advanced campaigns for black rights. In this book, Aston Gonzalez charts the changing roles of African American visual artists as they helped build the world they envisioned. Understudied artists such as Robert Douglass Jr., Patrick Henry Reason, James Presley Ball, and Augustus Washington produced images to persuade viewers of the necessity for racial equality, black political leadership, and freedom from slavery. Moreover, these activist artists’ networks of transatlantic patronage and travels to Europe, the Caribbean, and Africa reveal their extensive involvement in the most pressing concerns for black people in the Atlantic world. Their work demonstrates how images became central to the ways that people developed ideas about race, citizenship, and politics during the nineteenth century.","[{""name"": ""Aston Gonzalez"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1111/ehr.12964,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,"Urbanization and mortality in Britain, c. 1800-50","AbstractIn the long‐running debate over standards of living during the industrial revolution, pessimists have identified deteriorating health conditions in towns as undermining the positive effects of rising real incomes on the ‘biological standard of living’. This article reviews long‐run historical relationships between urbanization and epidemiological trends in England, and then addresses the specific question: did mortality rise especially in rapidly growing industrial and manufacturing towns in the period c. 1830–50? Using comparative data for British, European, and American cities and selected rural populations, this study finds good evidence for widespread increases in mortality in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. However, this phenomenon was not confined to ‘new’ or industrial towns. Instead, mortality rose in the 1830s especially among young children (aged one to four years) in a wide range of populations and environments. This pattern of heightened mortality extended between c. 1830 and c. 1870, and coincided with a well‐established rise and decline in scarlet fever virulence and mortality. The evidence presented here therefore supports claims that mortality worsened for young children in the middle decades of the nineteenth century, but also indicates that this phenomenon was more geographically ubiquitous, less severe, and less chronologically concentrated than previously argued.","[{""name"": ""Romola J.

I review contemporary scholarly understandings of immobility and disentangle the unavoidable relational dynamics with its positive linguistic opposite, mobility. Concrete illustrations from migration studies and the global coronavirus crisis illustrate how immobility, at various scales of analysis and experience, is not only theoretically but also socially, economically, and politically relevant. Together with the in-depth review of existing scholarship, these examples confirm that the conceptual distinction made between immobility and mobility is often purely heuristic. In the messiness of people’s lives, mobility and immobility are not mutually exclusive categories but, rather, two dynamic sides of the same coin.","[{""name"": ""Noel B.

One model states that I-type granites form by partial melting of older crustal lithologies (amphibolites or intermediate igneous rocks). In another view, granites are trapped rhyolitic liquids occurring at the end of fractionation trends defining a basalt–andesite–dacite–rhyolite series. This paper explores the thermal implications of both scenarios, using a heat balance model that abstracts the heat production and consumption during crustal melting. Heat is consumed by melting and by losses through the surface (conductive or advective, as a result of eruption). It is supplied as a basal conductive heat flux, as internal heat production or as advective heat carried by an influx of hot basalt into the crust. Using this abstract approach, it is possible to explore the role different parameters play in the balance of granites formed by differentiation of basalts or by crustal melting. Two end-member situations appear equally favourable to generating large volumes of granites: (1) short-lived environments dominated by high basaltic flux, where granites result mostly from basalt differentiation; and (2) long-lived systems with no or minimal basalt flux, with granites resulting chiefly from crustal melting.","[{""name"": ""Jean-François Moyen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1029/94JB00112"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2016.02.037"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(78)90123-1"", ""10.1007/s00410-008-0351-8"", ""10.1144/0016-76492007-166"", ""10.1130/MEM174"", ""10.1093/petrology/egl004"", ""10.1093/petrology/egi084"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2012.06.032"", ""10.2113/GSELEMENTS.4.1.17"", ""10.1016/S0024-4937(98)00085-1"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2012.01.017"", ""10.1016/j.gca.2005.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2006.12.007"", ""10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00665.x"", ""10.1016/j.gsf.2013.06.006"", ""10.1007/s004100050511"", ""10.1098/rsta.1984.0015"", ""10.1093/petrology/28.6.1111"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2009.03.008"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.1995.095.01.05"", ""10.2113/gselements.7.4.235"", ""10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00107-1"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2011.07.004"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030<0535:HOTSAC>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1016/S0191-8141(98)00073-X"", ""10.1130/G37398.1"", ""10.1029/2009GC002540"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2016.09.033"", ""10.1093/petrology/27.1.219"", ""10.1093/petrology/25.4.894"", ""10.1002/gj.3350250307"", ""10.1029/2011JB008692"", ""10.1111/jmg.12211"", ""10.2465/jmps.160128"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2010.01.022"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-63901-1.00007-1"", ""10.1007/s00410-009-0482-6"", ""10.1111/ter.12010"", ""10.2475/01.2018.03"", ""10.1007/s00410-009-0408-3"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2010.12.017"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46792-3"", ""10.1093/petrology/egs046"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2015.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.gsf.2014.09.006"", ""10.1029/164GM03"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1314.2010.00906.x"", ""10.1093/petrology/egu074"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(2003)031<0529:HACGIO>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2010.09.015"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2016.09.018"", ""10.1007/s00410-014-1015-5"", ""10.1093/petrology/egp022"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2015.12.015"", ""10.1093/petrology/37.6.1491"", ""10.1007/978-1-4684-7335-3_11"", ""10.1080/08120098708729391"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2009.06.006"", ""10.1016/B0-08-043751-6/03016-4"", ""10.1130/G40246.1"", ""10.1016/0016-7037(70)90009-8"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2009.05.028"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2015.10.005"", ""10.1038/267315a0"", ""10.1016/S0024-4937(00)00058-X"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807442"", ""10.1111/j.1365-3121.2010.00952.x"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(89)90169-8"", ""10.1016/0016-7037(95)00038-2"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2014.08.021"", ""10.1016/0191-8141(82)90021-9"", ""10.1029/JB094iB06p07685"", ""10.1038/nature07818""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],['Geophysics'],"[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"

Based on multi-sited archival research and memoirs, this article shows how Africans forged and used new routes to gain access to higher education denied to them in their territories of origin, and in this way also shaped scholarship policies across the globe. Focusing on British-ruled territories in East Africa, the article establishes the importance of African intermediaries and independent countries as hubs of mobility. The agency of students and intermediaries, as well as official responses, are examined in three interconnected cases: the clandestine ‘Nile route’ from East Africa to Egypt and eastern Europe; the ‘airlifts’ from East Africa to North America; and the ‘exodus’ of African students from the Eastern bloc to western Europe. Although all of these routes were short-lived, they transformed official scholarship provisions, and significantly shaped the postcolonial period in the countries of origin.","[{""name"": ""Eric Burton"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511584114"", ""10.1353/jwh.2019.0014"", ""10.1080/02582473.2017.1398776"", ""10.1017/S174002281900007X"", ""10.1017/S0021853715000304"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139344159"", ""10.1177/0022009416648253"", ""10.1080/03057070.2014.967487"", ""10.2307/27694378"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-02536-7"", ""10.2307/j.ctvh9vx9m"", ""10.2307/2642294"", ""10.1080/03057070.2017.1278982"", ""10.1017/S1740022816000164"", ""10.1080/14682745.2018.1485146"", ""10.1080/17531055.2015.1031859"", ""10.1080/03086534.2013.840438"", ""10.1057/9780230306486_14""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Anthropology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Available geochemical and isotopic systematics of these granitoids suggest variations in the source and petrogenetic mechanisms. By compiling the available geochemical data, these granitoids can be classified into four groups, namely: TTGs (tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite); sanukitoids; biotite and two-mica granites; and hybrid granites. This classification scheme is in line with the global classification of Neoarchean granites, and enables the sources and petrogenetic mechanisms of these variants to be distinguished. Available geochemical, isotopic and geochronological datasets of these granitoids are integrated and the existing tectonic models for the Neoarchean EDC are reviewed. The variability of the EDC granitoids is ascribed to crustal reworking associated with the collision of two continental blocks. The tectonomagmatic evolution of the EDC is analogous to the development of the Himalayan Orogeny. Based on the evolutionary history of the Dharwar Craton, it can be concluded that convergent margin tectonics were operational in the Indian Shield from at least c. 3.3 Ga and continued into the Phanerozoic. However, the nature and style of plate tectonics could be different with time.","[{""name"": ""M.

10.1017/S0738248021000407,LAW AND HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0301 Law,Creating a Common Law of Slavery for England and its New World Empire,"The current historical consensus is that English common law was somewhat confused, but that coerced servitude was legal in England before 1772, and certainly in its empire, where English law on slavery did not reach, because it was “beyond the line” of English justice. The common law is characterized by an effort to see continuity and consistency, and historians (despite our natural desire to track change) often look for those patterns too. Such efforts to provide a consistent overview of an England that was free and colonies that created slavery on their own—have obscured the vibrant struggle over slavery within the English judicial system—the common law—over more than a century. Not only did the common law on slavery change profoundly during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: the common law became an instrument of crown policy. It did so within a federal empire, wherein colonial legal norms had to adhere, in crucial ways, to that common law. English high court judges thus provided the legal foundation for an imperial common law of slavery that allowed people to be deemed absolute property. That definition of people as property was closely connected to absolutism, both in theory and practice. In theory the absolute power of kings over subjects was connected to that of masters over slaves. In practice, the crown's use of the courts to create laws without parliamentary consent (to bypass parliament) also increased crown revenue and thus their independence from parliamentary control. These powerful legal mechanisms made it possible to “recover” enslaved people as assets for debts, a legal definition that was essential for a market in people to function sucessfully. This history reveals the absolutist character of early capitalism, and the extent to which the character of capitalist development depends on the legal rules that define markets and justice.","[{""name"": ""Holly Brewer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S073824800000081X"", ""10.1353/book14889"", ""10.1086/385904"", ""10.2307/1599128"", ""10.5149/9780807838174_rushforth"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316718216""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

It explores the relationship between the original piece and theorist Rita Segato's insights on rape culture, and how it counters aspects of this culture. It examines how the transnational spread of Un violador counters tendencies of MeToo, and examines four cases of the performance's re‐staging in Latin America and beyond, showing how they make manifest the pervasiveness of rape culture as well as how groups have adapted them to speak to local issues.","[{""name"": ""Deborah Martin"", ""affiliation"": [""UCL  London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Deborah Shaw"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Portsmouth  Portsmouth UK""]}]","[""10.4159/9780674495548"", ""10.1080/10486801.2015.1049819"", ""10.4324/9780429425127-7"", ""10.2307/j.ctvscxrnj"", ""10.1215/26410478-1.1.198"", ""10.4324/9781315183596""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Urban Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1108/HESWBL-10-2019-0141,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,"""It's a very different world"": work transition and employability of higher education graduates","PurposeThis study addresses the specific topic of transition between higher education and the world of work, taking differences naturally inherent to the individual and to the surrounding micro and macro contexts. With a holistic approach, this paper aimed to provide a deeper understanding about the university-to-work transition process in a period of turbulence and continuous changes in the labour market.Design/methodology/approachThe three research questions that guide this qualitative study are as follows: (1) What are the factors that facilitate the transition to the labour market? (2) What are the factors that constrain the transition to the labour market? (3) What are graduates' perceptions of their employability? To answer these questions, eleven graduates were interviewed about facilitators and barriers of the transition process and perceptions of employability. Data collected from the interviews were then related to categories previously defined from the literature review. Version 12.0 of the NVivo software was used to support the process of data analysis.FindingsOverall, participants' discourse refer to a multidimensional and dynamic perspective of factors related with work transition and employability. The obtained results indicate that the lack of career agency during graduation and professional experiences, together with late career exploration processes, represent possible barriers of transition, especially in study fields with targeted job offers. Likewise, experiences promoting the development of competencies through supportive practice from teachers, mentors and colleagues are referred as facilitators of transition.Practical implicationsOne of the most consistent outcomes of the interviews conducted concerns the importance of a stronger focus on developing practical experiences during higher education studies. This empirical study demonstrated how this type of experience can mitigate the impact of the transition from university to the labour market.Originality/valueThis empirical study demonstrated how work being integrated into learning in curricula can mitigate the impact of the transition from university to the labour market. It offers important insights about possible strategies that could be adopted to promote graduates' employability from a perspective of shared responsibility.","[{""name"": ""Sílvia Monteiro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leandro Almeida"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adela García-Aracil"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-1-4020-5926-1_4"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-1353-6"", ""10.1108/CDI-08-2016-0135"", ""10.1111/1467-8624.00273"", ""10.1080/13639080701314613"", ""10.1080/02680930903349489"", ""10.1080/07294360802444347"", ""10.1007/s10775-007-9132-6"", ""10.1108/00400910710754435"", ""10.1007/s10212-012-0122-9"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.11.223"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-09-2014-0044"", ""10.1080/13538320120059990"", ""10.1002/ir.160"", ""10.1080/07294360.2016.1229270"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-08-2018-0086"", ""10.1080/1356251032000052294"", ""10.1002/j.2161-0045.1999.tb00739.x"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2013.07.001"", ""10.1080/03043790500087571"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-09-2015-0048"", ""10.1177/1469787409343189"", ""10.1002/j.1556-6678.2010.tb00006.x"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-11-99"", ""10.1787/eag-2018-en"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-04-2018-0049"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-10-2018-0098"", ""10.1177/1469787414544875"", ""10.1080/14616696.2013.821619"", ""10.1002/nur.4770180211"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2009.04.004"", ""10.1027/1015-5759.22.1.28"", ""10.1177/1469787404040457"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2014.10.005"", ""10.1002/job.712"", ""10.1080/13639080701650164"", ""10.1080/13562517.2014.901951"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2010.10.003"", ""10.1002/job.646""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"

Sophisticated predictions of lithology and porosity are being made from seismic data in reservoirs with good borehole log and core calibration for detailed integration with structural, palaeoenvironmental and sequence stratigraphic interpretations. Geologists can now characterize entire carbonate platform systems and their large-scale evolution in time and space, including systems with few outcrop analogues such as the Lower Cretaceous Central Atlantic ‘pre-salt’ carbonates. The papers introduced in this review illustrate opportunities, workflows and potential pitfalls of modern carbonate seismic interpretation. They demonstrate advances in knowledge of carbonate systems achieved when geologists and geophysicists collaborate and innovate to maximize the value of seismic data from acquisition, through processing to interpretation. Future trends and developments, including machine learning and the significance of the energy transition, are briefly discussed.","[{""name"": ""James Hendry"", ""affiliation"": [""Iapetus Geoscience Ltd, Unit 7, Watson &amp; Johnson Centre, Mill Road, Greystones, Co.

10.1093/pastj/gtaa028,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,OUT OF THE WEST: FORMATION OF A PERMANENT PLAGUE RESERVOIR IN SOUTH-CENTRAL GERMANY (1349-1356) AND ITS IMPLICATIONS,"Abstract This article deals with the origins and spread of the second outbreak of fourteenth-century plague pandemic, the pestis secunda, which swept over West Eurasia and North Africa between 1356 and 1366. Unlike the Black Death, its immediate predecessor, which seems to have originated in Central Asia, the pestis secunda emerged in Central Germany, most likely in the Frankfurt region, in summer 1356. Having seeded its new reservoir, the plague radiated from Central Germany, a landlocked region, into other parts of West Eurasia and North Africa, via inland routes. The inland mode of transmission is at odds with the geographic spread of the Black Death, whereby the plague arrived in West Eurasian and North African ports via maritime trade routes. To appreciate the appearance of the Central Germany plague reservoir in the early 1350s, the wider ecological, climatic and socio-economic context of the Frankfurt region is scrutinized, on the basis of textual, palaeoclimatic and palaeogenetic evidence. Although beyond the remit of this article, it argues that the Central German reservoir may have become the origin of recurrent late-medieval and early-modern plague outbreaks.","[{""name"": ""Philip Slavin"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Stirling""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']","['Genetics', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0710 生物学', 0.733), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7315)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

It asks whether this family could achieve a standard of living historically defined as ‘respectable’. It extracts information from primary and secondary sources to make adjustments for the participation rates of women and children, the varying number of days worked over time, the changing involvement of married women in paid work, and the evolving occupational structure. The resulting series is the first to depict the living standard of a representative working family over the very long run. Prior to the Black Death, this family existed just above subsistence; afterwards shortage of labour brought substantial albeit not unassailable gains. Tudor-era turmoil and constraints on women’s work pushed the family below the ‘respectable’ standard. From the mid 1600s however, the gradual transformation of the economy coincided with improved welfare. Over these centuries, it was rare for men’s work alone to sustain the family at a respectable level; women and children’s earnings were necessary. This article calls for a re-evaluation of the chronology, causes and consequences of long-run growth.","[{""name"": ""Sara Horrell"", ""affiliation"": [""London School of Economics""]}, {""name"": ""Jane Humphries"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford and London School of Economics""]}, {""name"": ""Jacob Weisdorf"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford and London School of Economics""]}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

Unfortunately, neural networks are known to suffer from various safety and security issues. Formal verification is a promising avenue for tackling this difficulty, by formally certifying that networks are correct. We propose an SMT-based technique for verifyingbinarized neural networks— a popular kind of neural network, where some weights have been binarized in order to render the neural network more memory and energy efficient, and quicker to evaluate. One novelty of our technique is that it allows the verification of neural networks that include both binarized and non-binarized components. Neural network verification is computationally very difficult, and so we propose here various optimizations, integrated into our SMT procedure as deduction steps, as well as an approach for parallelizing verification queries. We implement our technique as an extension to the Marabou framework, and use it to evaluate the approach on popular binarized neural network architectures.","[{""name"": ""Guy Amir"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Haoze Wu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clark Barrett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guy Katz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-44534-8_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_11"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2012.6248110"", ""10.7249/R366"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_3"", ""10.1109/SP.2018.00058"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-55754-6_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_3"", ""10.1109/DASC.2016.7778091"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.257.3"", ""10.1007/s10703-021-00363-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26"", ""10.1145/3341216.3342218"", ""10.1609/aaai.v29i1.9513"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.12206"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46493-0_32"", ""10.1007/s10994-021-06050-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_2"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00748"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11623""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Hardware and Architecture']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)]]"

We use physical models to investigate the impact of base-salt relief on deformation patterns. First, we investigate early-stage gravity gliding across base-salt relief. Salt flowing onto structural high blocks forms a zone of thickened salt and associated shortening owing to a flux mismatch. On the downdip edge of the basement high another flux mismatch generates a topographic monocline (ramp-syncline basin) with associated extensional and contractional hinges. With multiple base-salt high blocks, this structural pattern was repeated down the entire slope. Laterally discontinuous base-salt relief generated additional complexities such as major rotations of raft blocks and intervening diapirs as salt is channelled around and between base-salt relief. At the allochthonous level, regional dip, salt budget and base-salt relief influence flow patterns. Individual salt sheets spread sub-radially with streamlines skewed down the regional slope. As the canopy coalesced along allosutures, inward flow from the canopy peripheries dominated, driven by more vigorous flow from outer feeders owing to less competition for source-layer salt. Subsequent shortening returned flow patterns to grossly dip-parallel. However, salt flows fastest where it is thickest and thus chains of feeders channel rapid intracanopy flow.","[{""name"": ""Tim P.

Compared to the ‘First’, the rise of Britain during the Industrial Revolution, this Second Great Divergence is curiously little understood: because the United States remains the template for modernization narratives, its trajectory is more easily accepted as preordained than interrogated as an unlikely historical outcome. But why should development have been problematic everywhere but the United States? This Viewpoint argues that a robust explanation for the United States's rise is lacking: it can neither be found in an economic history literature focused on factor endowments nor in internalist Americanist historiography, which often reproduces overdetermined accounts of modernization inspired by Max Weber. The most promising avenue of inquiry, we argue, lies in asking how American political institutions configured what should properly be called an American developmental state. Such a perspective opens up a broad comparative research agenda that provincializes the United States from the perspective of development experiences elsewhere.","[{""name"": ""Stefan Link"", ""affiliation"": [""Dartmouth College""]}, {""name"": ""Noam Maggor"", ""affiliation"": [""Queen Mary University of London""]}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1093/pastj/gtz029,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,THE BATTLE OF MUHAMMAD MAHMOUD STREET IN CAIRO: THE POLITICS AND POETICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE IN REVOLUTIONARY TIME,"Abstract The battle of Muhammad Mahmoud Street in November 2011, pitching protestors against security forces in a five-day long stand-off, represented a crucial episode of Egypt's 25 January Revolution. Part riot and part carnival, this event opens up a number of questions for historians. This article examines the battle on three distinct scales, paying particular attention to time and temporality. The first scale is the battle's position within the temporality of the Egyptian revolution. The article argues that revolutionary situations are best understood through concepts of liminal time, and that the winter of 2011, rather than the initial stage of the Tahrir Square sit-in in January–February, represented the crucial phase of the revolutionary process in Egypt. A second scale zooms in on street action, focusing on the nexus of class, masculinity and urban violence. Here, raw experiences on the ground inform subjective meanings of ‘violence', ‘politics' and ‘revolution' from the perspective of those who were most directly involved in their making. These experiences also reveal different temporal horizons experienced by diverse participants, which, however, did not remain unchanged as events unfolded. The third scale is historically comparative, delving into spontaneously enacted riotous and carnivalesque urban violence as reflected in classic literature on riots and carnivals in different contexts. The battle of November 2011 allow us to see the generic affinity between these liminal events and the persistence of the riotous and carnivalesque within modern revolutionary situations, as it may help us understand the resurgence of riots within the contemporary world.","[{""name"": ""Lucie Ryzova"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Birmingham""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X19000396,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,"TEENAGE GIRLS, FEMALE FRIENDSHIP AND THE MAKING OF THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION IN ENGLAND, 1950-1980","AbstractHow can we explain rising levels of pre-marital sex in post-war Britain? Focusing on the experiences of young women growing up in Britain between 1950 and 1980, this article argues that changes in sexual practice were brought about by shifts in the social value of sexual knowledge and experience. While the figure of the ‘nice girl’ was still central to understandings of respectable femininity, across this period social status and reputation became linked to demonstrations of attractiveness and sexual knowing. For girls of the post-war generation, discussions of sex were central to how they related to those around them, and the decisions that teenagers made about their own sexual practice were informed by their perceptions of what their friends and peers would think of them. The article argues that, by considering the history of sexuality at a ‘local’ scale between the macro-level of culture and the micro-level of individual sexual selfhood, we not only gain an important new perspective on the everyday sexual experience but also uncover new processes of socio-sexual change.","[{""name"": ""HANNAH CHARNOCK"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09612029400200044"", ""10.1080/14681810500038848"", ""10.1080/03071022.2013.872904"", ""10.1057/9781137328632"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719084553.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203357057"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199605194.001.0001"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwq048"", ""10.4324/9780203956809"", ""10.1080/0954025022000020063"", ""10.1017/S0018246X1600011X"", ""10.1080/0013191790310302"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hww051"", ""10.1086/493411"", ""10.2307/588234"", ""10.1177/0022009405051556"", ""10.1002/9781118349229"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511778353"", ""10.1177/001789697103000102"", ""10.1080/13619462.2016.1206822"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-21168-5""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Nation‐states see their sovereign powers eroded and are transformed to post‐national states as the political space they govern is no longer congruent with the socio‐economic space which transcends the national borders. Nonetheless, the nation continues to be a powerful source of identity and legitimacy. We are actually witnessing in Europe and worldwide a comeback of nationalism oftentimes in an aggressive, nativist and populist guise. This paper seeks to offer a new analytical lens through which to make sense of this new tide of nationalism. It therefore reviews critically the ethnic vs civic and perennialist, primordialist, modernist and ethnosymbolist approaches to suggest that they are no longer fit for purpose in explaining where nations and nationalism come from and where they are headed to. The paper proposes a new analytical framework which distinguishes between plural and neo‐tribal nationalism, focusing on how nations interact with diversity and permeability in the 21st century context.","[{""name"": ""Anna Triandafyllidou"", ""affiliation"": [""Ryerson University Faculty of Arts ‐ Sociology 350 Victoria street dept of Sociology, Faculty of Arts Toronto Toronto Ontario Canada""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780195072334.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9780470997116.ch9"", ""10.1068/d1509"", ""10.1080/1070289X.2018.1494968"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-58987-3_11"", ""10.1111/spsr.12260"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-58987-3_12"", ""10.21104/CL.2016.1.03"", ""10.4324/9780203960899"", ""10.1080/15348431.2016.1179189"", ""10.1177/1463499616652513"", ""10.1080/01419870.2015.1058503"", ""10.1080/13608746.2011.605612"", ""10.1111/nana.12515"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511612107"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-58987-3_13"", ""10.1186/s40878-018-0082-6"", ""10.1080/15562948.2017.1317895"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9020.2011.00387.x"", ""10.1080/096922997347715"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00498.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-923X.2003.00584.x"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00337"", ""10.1515/9781503612846"", ""10.4324/9780203876558"", ""10.4324/9780203217511"", ""10.1515/9781400820849"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2016.1251013"", ""10.1080/014198798329784"", ""10.4324/9780203167496"", ""10.1057/9780230390898_7"", ""10.1080/07036337.2013.848206"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-56065-0"", ""10.1177/1468796813483287"", ""10.1515/9780748644537"", ""10.4324/9780203867549"", ""10.1515/9780804766036""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Detrital zircon dating is a technique that is increasingly applied to sedimentary provenance studies. However, sand routing information using zircon analysis alone may be obscured by repeated sedimentary reworking cycles and mineral fertility variations. These biases are illustrated by two clear case studies from the Triassic–Jurassic of the Barents Shelf where the use of U–Pb geochronology on apatite and rutile and Pb–Pb isotopic data from K-feldspar is highly beneficial for provenance interpretations. In the first case study, U–Pb apatite ages from the (Induan – Norian) Havert, Kobbe and Snadd formations indicate an evolving provenance and identify possible episodes of storage within foreland basins prior to delivery onto the Barents Shelf. In the second case study, U–Pb rutile and Pb isotopic analyses of K-feldspar from the Norian–Pliensbachian Realgrunnen Subgroup provide a clear distinction between north Norwegian Caledonides and Fennoscandian Shield sources and suggest that a similar approach may be used to test competing models for sand dispersal for this Subgroup in regions farther north than this study.","[{""name"": ""Michael J.

We propose a logical framework based on first-order logic, and develop the main tool we rely upon for achieving the automation of proofs of quantum specification: PPS, a parametric extension of the recently developed path sum semantics. To back-up our claims, we implement and verify parametric versions of several famous and non-trivial quantum algorithms, including the quantum parts of Shor’s integer factoring, quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Grover’s search.","[{""name"": ""Christophe Chareton"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sébastien Bardin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""François Bobot"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Valentin Perrelle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benoît Valiron"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4204/EPTCS.287.1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_1"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1666-5"", ""10.26421/QIC3.2-8"", ""10.1109/ISMVL.2019.00026"", ""10.1038/nature23474"", ""10.1145/3385412.3386007"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.195.6"", ""10.4086/toc.2018.v014a011"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.3408"", ""10.1145/242223.242257"", ""10.1098/rspa.1998.0164"", ""10.1017/9781316219317"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.318.6"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.287.5"", ""10.1126/science.1057726"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73368-3_21"", ""10.1007/s10703-016-0243-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-70545-1_51"", ""10.1103/RevModPhys.86.153"", ""10.1007/s00224-018-9872-3"", ""10.1145/2499370.2462177"", ""10.1145/237814.237866"", ""10.1109/TCAD.2019.2897703"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502"", ""10.1145/3434318"", ""10.1145/3307650.3322213"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_22"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2009.07.045"", ""10.1145/3428218"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25543-5_12"", ""10.1109/FOCS.2018.00033"", ""10.1145/3428198"", ""10.1007/s10817-019-09518-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59936-6_7"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009894"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.287.17"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.266.8"", ""10.1017/S0960129506005238"", ""10.23919/DATE.2018.8341993"", ""10.22331/q-2018-01-31-49"", ""10.1145/3183895.3183901"", ""10.1109/MC.2016.293"", ""10.1145/2699415"", ""10.1145/2049706.2049708"", ""10.1007/s00165-018-0465-3"", ""10.1145/2629680"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009840""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Computer Science']","['Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7711), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7598)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1017/S0020859019000774,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Women and Gender in the Mines: Challenging Masculinity Through History: An Introduction,"AbstractThe role of women as mineworkers and as household workers has been erased. Here, we challenge the masculinity associated with the mines, taking a longer-term and a global labour history perspective. We foreground the importance of women as mineworkers in different parts of the world since the early modern period and analyse the changes introduced in coal mining in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the masculinization and mechanization, and the growing importance of women in contemporary artisanal and small-scale mining. The effect of protective laws and the exclusion of women from underground tasks was to restrict women's work more to the household, which played a pivotal role in mining communities but is insufficiently recognized. This process of “de-labourization” of women's work was closely connected with the distinction between productive and unproductive labour. This introductory article therefore centres on the important work carried out in the household by women and children. Finally, we present the three articles in this Special Theme and discuss how each of them is in dialogue with the topics addressed here. Many thanks also to Marie-José Spreeuwenberg for her invaluable engagement.","[{""name"": ""Rossana Barragán Romano"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leda Papastefanaki"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0147547906000093"", ""10.1353/crb.2015.0004"", ""10.1017/S0147547909000064"", ""10.17159/2413-3027/2017/v30n2a3"", ""10.2307/27516230"", ""10.3167/9781785339110"", ""10.14237/ebl.9.1.2018.1079"", ""10.1007/BF03376906"", ""10.36019/9780813563695"", ""10.1016/j.resourpol.2007.03.002"", ""10.1002/j.1834-4461.2006.tb03041.x"", ""10.1017/S0020859011000502"", ""10.1215/15476715-7323601"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1zxsmqx.6"", ""10.5406/jamerethnhist.30.4.0044"", ""10.1017/S0018246X09990100"", ""10.1057/fr.2008.5"", ""10.1080/09614520600562488"", ""10.1080/0966369X.2012.737770"", ""10.2307/42635925"", ""10.1080/0966369X.2011.572433"", ""10.3917/lms.249.0091"", ""10.1080/13552074.2015.1095560"", ""10.1017/S0020859008003453"", ""10.2752/174063109X380017"", ""10.1016/j.resourpol.2008.12.001"", ""10.1515/9781782041870"", ""10.1017/S0010417511000454"", ""10.14430/arctic4202"", ""10.3098/ah.2018.092.3.328"", ""10.1080/13552074.2017.1379780"", ""10.1080/13547860.2014.880287"", ""10.4000/bifea.8354"", ""10.3197/096734007780473500"", ""10.1111/wusa.12423"", ""10.1215/15476715-7323613"", ""10.1080/13552074.2017.1379775"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2014.933999"", ""10.1016/j.resourpol.2013.11.002"", ""10.1007/s11077-009-9091-5"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-73399-6_12"", ""10.22459/LMLP.10.2017.11"", ""10.2307/j.ctv6gqt3h.11"", ""10.1177/000203971404900201"", ""10.1017/S0008938914001939"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-73399-6"", ""10.1017/S0147547906000032"", ""10.1215/00182168-1902778"", ""10.1177/097152310801500204"", ""10.2307/j.ctt4cgrkb.5"", ""10.1177/0376983614544573"", ""10.1163/9789004360433_011"", ""10.1080/07075332.2017.1395761"", ""10.1177/004908570703700403"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbt012"", ""10.5117/9789462984363"", ""10.1016/j.exis.2014.08.004"", ""10.1086/651039"", ""10.1080/00020180701482701"", ""10.2307/j.ctt4cgn2r"", ""10.1007/s10761-011-0166-6"", ""10.1086/665962"", ""10.1080/19472498.2013.768846""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Building and Construction', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1007/s11698-021-00224-7,CLIOMETRICA,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,The significance of climate variability on early modern European grain prices,"AbstractGrain was the most important food source in early modern Europe (c. 1500–1800), and its price influenced the entire economy. The extent to which climate variability determined grain price variations remains contested, and claims of solar cycle influences on prices are disputed. We thoroughly reassess these questions, within a framework of comprehensive statistical analysis, by employing an unprecedentedly large grain price data set together with state-of-the-art palaeoclimate reconstructions and long meteorological series. A highly significant negative grain price–temperature relationship (i.e. colder = high prices and vice versa) is found across Europe. This association increases at larger spatial and temporal scales and reaches a correlation of$$-\,0.41$$-0.41considering the European grain price average and previous year June–August temperatures at annual resolution, and of$$-\,0.63$$-0.63at decadal timescales. This strong relationship is of episodic rather than periodic (cyclic) nature. Only weak and spatially inconsistent signals of hydroclimate (precipitation and drought), and no meaningful association with solar variations, are detected in the grain prices. The significant and persistent temperature effects on grain prices imply that this now rapidly changing climate element has been a more important factor in European economic history, even in southern Europe, than commonly acknowledged.","[{""name"": ""Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Thejll"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bo Christiansen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea Seim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Claudia Hartl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Esper"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S1361491600000125"", ""10.1163/24523666-00401006"", ""10.1017/S002205070009865X"", ""10.2307/2342284"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00540.x"", ""10.4324/9781315655321"", ""10.1006/exeh.1996.0025"", ""10.1023/A:1005502518695"", ""10.1017/S1361491601000119"", ""10.1038/347164a0"", ""10.1017/S0022050719000524"", ""10.2307/2341183"", ""10.5194/cp-15-1-2019"", ""10.1016/j.palaeo.2011.10.014"", ""10.1002/joc.1836"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2014.12.001"", ""10.3354/cr00848"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_587970"", ""10.18172/cig.3395"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00492.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139031110"", ""10.1007/s10584-016-1797-8"", ""10.1007/s10584-017-1931-2"", ""10.1086/596640"", ""10.1038/034100c0"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2012.09.002"", ""10.1175/JCLI4107.1"", ""10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00814.1"", ""10.1002/2016RG000521"", ""10.1175/2008JCLI2301.1"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00564.x"", ""10.1177/095968369700700314"", ""10.1007/s12685-016-0152-3"", ""10.2307/203061"", ""10.1007/s10584-009-9724-x"", ""10.1126/science.192.4245.1189"", ""10.1080/03585520802631592"", ""10.1016/j.dendro.2012.11.002"", ""10.1007/s00445-013-0736-z"", ""10.3354/cr01449"", ""10.1017/S1361491610000146"", ""10.3354/cr032025"", ""10.1002/jqs.1302"", ""10.1029/2009RG000282"", ""10.1126/science.272.5264.981"", ""10.1098/rsta.2002.1111"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674332157"", ""10.18261/ISSN1894-3195-2015-03-04"", ""10.1098/rstl.1801.0015"", ""10.1515/9780691187204"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195094138.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-54337-6_3"", ""10.1016/j.jhg.2017.05.011"", ""10.1177/0959683616646188"", ""10.1038/019033d0"", ""10.1038/019588a0"", ""10.1007/978-1-4757-3365-5_4"", ""10.5194/gmd-10-4005-2017"", ""10.1214/14-AOAS753"", ""10.1162/JINH_a_00573"", ""10.1038/252002a0"", ""10.24894/978-3-7965-3447-8"", ""10.1023/A:1005590115970"", ""10.1016/j.jastp.2019.01.012"", ""10.1017/9781108355780.003"", ""10.1038/nature17418"", ""10.1016/j.jas.2018.08.006"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/ab2c7e"", ""10.1002/wcc.691"", ""10.1002/grl.50846"", ""10.1002/qj.49710042511"", ""10.1007/978-1-4757-3365-5_10"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0088(19970615)17:7<667::AID-JOC115>3.0.CO;2-J"", ""10.3197/096734011X13150366551652"", ""10.1038/s41550-018-0638-2"", ""10.1007/s00357-014-9161-z"", ""10.1017/S0022050700017903"", ""10.3390/agriculture6030029"", ""10.1029/2002JA009390"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496820"", ""10.1023/A:1005585931899"", ""10.1002/2016JD025034"", ""10.1163/9789004615472"", ""10.2307/2979211"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-55953-7"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.73.951"", ""10.1007/s11207-004-5356-5"", ""10.1017/S0956793313000186"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.12012"", ""10.1016/S0167-2789(00)00043-9"", ""10.1038/276348a0"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139104234"", ""10.1007/s11207-015-0815-8"", ""10.1007/s00382-014-2331-1"", ""10.1162/JINH_a_01050"", ""10.1029/2000JD000148"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004194397.i-464"", ""10.1163/9789004476127"", ""10.1017/S136149169900009X"", ""10.1038/ngeo2962"", ""10.1080/01621459.1963.10500845"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-43020-5_27"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511599637.009""]","['Environmental Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Atmospheric Science', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Global and Planetary Change']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0706 大气科学', 0.7502), ('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7343)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)]]"

It formed between the northern leading edge of the Taurides platform and the Kırşehir block since Late Cretaceous time. We have constructed five regional cross-sections supported by field data and 2D seismic to constrain the structure of the basin and its evolution. The area is divided into three tectonic domains from south to north: (1) a Maastrichtian to Eocene north-verging fold-and-thrust belt, which terminates by a regional Eocene evaporitic level; (2) an Oligo-Miocene salt domain which contains two generations of minibasins separated by a salt canopy, forming a salt-and-thrust belt; and (3) a late Miocene to present day foreland basin. The cross-sections show the along-strike variations and the increasing shortening in the fold-and-thrust belt from west ( c. 15 km) to east ( c. 25 km). The thick salt allows for the intracutaneous propagation of the fold-and-thrust belt below a domain of salt withdrawal minibasins, decoupled as the initial salt thickness increases. In that case, the salt domain is thrusted both frontward and backward. Efficient exhumation followed by erosion of the fold-and-thrust resulted in synorogenic salt tectonics in the foreland and thus increased the mechanical resistance between them.","[{""name"": ""Etienne Legeay"", ""affiliation"": [""E2S UPPA CNRS/TOTAL/Univ Pau &amp;

For large messages, this capability is designed to achieve reduction bandwidths similar to those of point-to-point messages of the same size, and complements the latency-optimized low-latency aggregation reduction capabilities, aimed at small data reductions. MPI_Allreduce() bandwidth measured on an HDR InfiniBand based system achieves about 95% of network bandwidth. For medium and large data reduction this also improves the reduction bandwidth by a factor of 2–5 relative to host-based (e.g., software-based) reduction algorithms. Using this capability also increased DL-Poly and PyTorch application performance by as much as 4% and 18%, respectively. This paper describes SHARP Streaming-Aggregation hardware architecture and a set of synthetic and application benchmarks used to study this new reduction capability, and the range of data sizes for which Streaming-Aggregation performs better than the low-latency aggregation algorithm.","[{""name"": ""Richard L.

Land cover classification is essential basic information and key parameters for environmental change research, geographical and national monitoring, and sustainable development planning. Deep learning can automatically and multi-level extract the features of complex features, which has been proven to be an effective method for information extraction. However, one of the major challenges of deep learning is its poor interpret-ability, which makes it difficult to understand and explain the reasoning behind its classification results. This paper proposes a deep cross-modal coupling model (CMCM) for integrating semantic features and visual features. The representation of knowledge map is indicatively introduced into remote sensing image classification. Compared to previous studies, the proposed method provides accurate descriptions of the complex semantic objects within a complex land cover environment. The results showed that the integration of semantic knowledge improved the accuracy and interpret-ability of land cover classification.","[{""name"": ""J.

We present Paracosm, a framework for writing systematic test scenarios for autonomous driving simulations. Paracosm allows users to programmatically describe complex driving situations with specific features, e.g., road layouts and environmental conditions, as well as reactive temporal behaviors of other cars and pedestrians. A systematic exploration of the state space, both for visual features and for reactive interactions with the environment is made possible. We define a notion of test coverage for parameter configurations based on combinatorial testing and low dispersion sequences. Using fuzzing on parameter configurations, our automatic test generator can maximize coverage of various behaviors and find problematic cases. Through empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the capabilities of Paracosm in programmatically modeling parameterized test environments, and in finding problematic scenarios.","[{""name"": ""Rupak Majumdar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aman Mathur"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marcus Pirron"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Stegner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Damien Zufferey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3180155.3180160"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-19835-9_21"", ""10.1145/2970276.2970311"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24953-7_35"", ""10.1007/s10703-017-0286-7"", ""10.1145/3126521"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-57288-8_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_1"", ""10.1145/3302504.3313351"", ""10.1109/ACC.2015.7171969"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314633"", ""10.1145/3338906.3338942"", ""10.1145/3293882.3330566"", ""10.1109/SP.2018.00058"", ""10.1109/ASE.2019.00013"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11164-3_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-44833-4_6"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2019.00108"", ""10.6028/NIST.SP.800-142"", ""10.1007/978-1-4302-3748-8"", ""10.1145/3238147.3238202"", ""10.1145/3158134"", ""10.1109/MODELS.2019.00-12"", ""10.1137/1.9781611970081"", ""10.1145/3052973.3053009"", ""10.1145/3132747.3132785"", ""10.14722/ndss.2017.23404"", ""10.1016/0895-7177(96)00036-2"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/368 10.24963/ijcai.2018/368"", ""10.1145/2483760.2483790"", ""10.1145/2185632.2185653"", ""10.1145/3180155.3180220"", ""10.1109/IVS.2018.8500421"", ""10.1145/3178126.3187004"", ""10.1145/349299.349331"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_22""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Software', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

We present new U–Pb laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ages of detrital and magmatic zircon from the Saghro, M'Gouna, and Ouarzazate Groups. The siliciclastic deposits of the Saghro Group were deposited in a back-arc setting developed on stretched continental crust of the West African margin. Collision with the Atlas–Meseta domain led to the closure of the back-arc basin before 600 Ma. Time of exhumation and surface exposure of the newly formed Pan-African basement is bracketed to c. 30 Ma owing to the maximum depositional age of 571 ± 4 Ma of the overlying M'Gouna Group. The U–Pb age of 567 ± 4 Ma for the lowermost ignimbrite of the Ouarzazate Group limits the time for the deposition of the M'Gouna Group to less than 4 Ma. The Pan-African orogeny was finished at c. 600 Ma whereas the onset of transtension related to Cadomian back-arc formation was very much younger from c. 570 Ma onwards.","[{""name"": ""Ezzoura Errami"", ""affiliation"": [""Université Cadi Ayyad, Faculté Polydisciplinaire de Safi, B.P. 4162, 46 000 Safi, Morocco""]}, {""name"": ""Ulf Linnemann"", ""affiliation"": [""Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Mandy Hofmann"", ""affiliation"": [""Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Andreas Gärtner"", ""affiliation"": [""Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Johannes Zieger"", ""affiliation"": [""Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Jessica Gärtner"", ""affiliation"": [""Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Katja Mende"", ""affiliation"": [""Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Jamal El Kabouri"", ""affiliation"": [""Université Chouaïb Doukkali, Faculté des Sciences, EGGPG, B.P. 20, 24000 El Jadida, Morocco""]}, {""name"": ""Dominique Gasquet"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratoire EDYTEM, Université Savoie Mont Blanc, CNRS-UMR5204, Campus scientifique, 73376, Le Bourget du Lac, France""]}, {""name"": ""Nasser Ennih"", ""affiliation"": [""Université Chouaïb Doukkali, Faculté des Sciences, EGGPG, B.P. 20, 24000 El Jadida, Morocco""]}]","[""10.1016/j.precamres.2010.05.018"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2012.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2020.103946"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2014.04.026"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2011.06.005"", ""10.1016/0899-5362(90)90105-N"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2016.08.016"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2018.10.008"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.07.044"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2016.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2014.04.021"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2020.03.011"", ""10.1007/s00126-002-0317-0"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2009.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2006.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2007.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2012.07.022"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2010.06.011"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2019.103669"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2019.103669"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2017.12.039"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(01)00195-4"", ""10.1144/SP297.1"", ""10.1016/S0899-5362(02)00048-9"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2012.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2009.02.006"", ""10.2113/0530277"", ""10.1016/S0899-5362(03)00049-6"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(00)00065-6"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2008.07.025"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2005.06.009"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-77076-3_2"", ""10.1130/L121.1"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2006.06.039"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(03)00023-4"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(00)00078-4"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(02)00109-2"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2014.03.007"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2020.05.014"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.07.041"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2004.06.017"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2015.03.003"", ""10.1086/319979"", ""10.1139/e80-012"", ""10.1016/0301-9268(94)90019-1"", ""10.1139/cjes-2017-0086"", ""10.1029/JB088iS02p0A887"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.2000.179.01.10"", ""10.1007/s00531-004-0413-8"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2013.08.007"", ""10.1007/s00531-017-1520-7"", ""10.1139/e05-062"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2011.09.056"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-77076-3_1"", ""10.1016/j.crte.2017.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2017.11.030"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2017.07.007"", ""10.1016/0899-5362(96)00002-4"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2012.03.010"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2004.08.003"", ""10.1007/BF00310745"", ""10.1016/j.cageo.2003.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2007.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2013.04.003"", ""10.2113/174.1.83"", ""10.1016/j.crte.2018.07.002"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(75)90088-6"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2009.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.07.059"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(02)00075-X"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.07.046"", ""10.1130/RF.L001.1"", ""10.1007/s00710-012-0245-3"", ""10.1016/j.jog.2015.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2017.10.022"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2020.105610"", ""10.3390/min8120592"", ""10.1016/0301-9268(94)90094-9"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2012.06.010"", ""10.1007/BF00372872"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2013.07.003""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],['Geophysics'],"[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"

We examine how the arguments of the NDM are reminiscent of other struggles within the broadly defined arena of disability activism, mad pride, and consumer-survivor movements and show how the NDM co-opts medical language to avoid the tradition developed by anti-psychiatrists who fundamentally reject psychiatry altogether.","[{""name"": ""Erika Dyck"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ginny Russell"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Neurology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7465), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7432)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

With a focus on the port cities of Seville and Cartagena, I explore how freedom litigation suits illuminate how individuals from starkly different social worlds and intellectual milieus—who inhabited the same urban sites—affected and shaped one another's intellectual landscapes. I trace how enslaved Africans’ epistemologies of just slavery shaped broader discourses on the just enslavement of Africans in the Spanish Empire.","[{""name"": ""Chloe L.

Here we integrate gravity, bathymetry and 2D seismic datasets to investigate the structural and stratigraphic variation in the southern part of the Hikurangi subduction wedge, onshore and offshore North Island, New Zealand. Three morphostructural portions are recognized: The inner portion demonstrates reactivation of inherited structures, producing thick-skinned deformation. Pre-subduction rocks are represented by kilometres of acoustically chaotic seismofacies. Thick-skinned deformation and readily deformable substrate lead to the development of wide trench-slope sub-basins, infilled with &gt;5 km of syn-subduction sediments. The mid portion typically demonstrates thrust faults with connections to deeper structures, leading to the development of an imbricate system with asymmetrical sub-basins typically &lt;5 km thick developed on the back-limb of thrust related folds. An antiformal stack marks the transition from the thick-skinned interior of the basin to the thin-skinned accretionary prism. Beyond this, the relatively non-deformed outer portion demonstrates frontal folds, propagating thrusts and up to 3 km thickness of syn-subduction strata. Structural variation across the subduction wedge controls the generation of accommodation with implications for sediment distribution within fold and thrust belts and for petroleum system development.","[{""name"": ""A.

10.1093/pastj/gtz028,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,THE PATH TO PISTOIA: URBAN HYGIENE BEFORE THE BLACK DEATH,"Abstract When the Black Death struck Western Europe in late 1347, city dwellers across the region were already practising public health, in part by building, maintaining and monitoring infrastructures whose prophylactic value emerged from the experience of intensified urbanization. The demands of a new urban metabolism, evident from the twelfth century, prompted numerous cities, including Pistoia, to develop preventative health programmes in anticipation of and in response to diverse threats. The latter certainly included famine, floods, pestilence and war, but Pistoians and others were no less concerned by routine matters such as burials, food quality, travel and work safety, artisanal pollution and domestic waste disposal. All of these were recognized as impacting people’s health, based on the medical and natural-philosophical theories prevalent at the time, and their management took into consideration not only climactic conditions and multi-species behaviour, but also the smooth functioning of sites such as wells, canals, bridges and roads. The political value that municipalities and other stakeholders began to place on the upkeep of these sites exceeded their economic function and thus questions the seminal role that scholars tend to attribute to the second plague pandemic in public health history. It also demonstrates how a key aspect of Euro-American modernity continues to shape interpretations of urban and health histories and suggests a broader path for historicizing community prophylactics.","[{""name"": ""G Geltner"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Amsterdam""]}]",[],"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']",['Genetics'],"[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0710 生物学', 0.733), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7315)]]"

Falsification, given a desired temporal specification, tries to find an input of violation instead of a proof guarantee. The state-of-the-art falsification approaches often employ stochastic hill-climbing optimization that minimizes the degree of satisfaction of the temporal specification, given by its quantitativerobust semantics. However, it has been shown that the performance of falsification could be severely affected by the so-calledscale problem, related to the different scales of the signals used in the specification (e.g., rpm and speed): in the robustness computation, the contribution of a signal could bemaskedby another one. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle this problem. We first introduce a new robustness definition, calledQB-Robustness, which combines classical Boolean satisfaction and quantitative robustness. We prove that QB-Robustness can be used to judge the satisfaction of the specification and avoid the scale problem in its computation. QB-Robustness is exploited by a falsification approach based on Monte Carlo Tree Search over the structure of the formal specification. First, tree traversal identifies the sub-formulas for which it is needed to compute the quantitative robustness. Then, on the leaves, numerical hill-climbing optimization is performed, aiming to falsify such sub-formulas. Our in-depth evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates that our approach achieves better falsification results than the state-of-the-art falsification approaches guided by the classical quantitative robustness, and it is largely not affected by the scale problem.","[{""name"": ""Zhenya Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Deyun Lyu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paolo Arcaini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lei Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ichiro Hasuo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jianjun Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483411"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_24"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.257.2"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-19835-9_21"", ""10.1145/1985793.1985795"", ""10.1109/CEC.2005.1554902"", ""10.1109/TCIAIG.2012.2186810"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24953-7_35"", ""10.1145/3126521"", ""10.1109/COASE.2017.8256286"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15297-9_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_10"", ""10.1145/2883817.2883838"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-57288-8_26"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2009.06.021"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_29"", ""10.1145/3302504.3311800"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31424-7_34"", ""10.1145/2562059.2562140"", ""10.1109/MCS.2016.2602089"", ""10.1109/PRDC47002.2019.00054"", ""10.1007/11871842_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10512-3_11"", ""10.1109/DASC.2015.7311613"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02450-5_6"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2004.03.072"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63588-0"", ""10.1145/2331147.2331165"", ""10.1038/nature16961"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66845-1_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95582-7_27"", ""10.1109/TCAD.2020.3013073"", ""10.1109/TCAD.2018.2858463"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-76384-8_24""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Information Systems', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

It is therefore particularly suitable for the analysis of rifted margins and their associated ocean basins. Maps of crustal thickness and conjugate-margin stretching, derived from gravity anomaly inversion, are used to illustrate how the Equatorial Atlantic opened as a set of stepped rift-transform segments, rather than as a simple orthogonal rifted margin. The influence of the transform faults and associated oceanic fracture zones is particularly clear when the results of the gravity anomaly inversion are combined with a shaded-relief display of the free-air gravity anomaly. A set of crustal cross-sections has been extracted from the results of the gravity inversion along both equatorial margins. These illustrate the crustal structure of both rifted-margin segments and transform-margin segments. The maps and cross-sections are used to delineate crustal type on the margins as (1) inboard, entirely continental, (2) outboard, entirely oceanic and (3) the ocean–continent transition in between where mixed continental and magmatic crust is likely to be present. For a given parameterization of melt generation the amount of magmatic addition within the ocean–continent transition is predicted by the gravity inversion. One of the strengths of the gravity-inversion technique is that these predictions can be made in the absence of any other directly acquired data. On both margins anomalously thick crust is resolved close to a number of oceanic fracture zones. On the South American margin we believe that this thick crust is probably the result of post-break-up magmatism within what was originally normal-thickness oceanic crust. On the West African margin, however, three possible origins are discussed: (1) continental crust extended oceanwards along the fracture zones; (2) oceanic crust magmatically thickened at the fracture zones; and (3) oceanic crust thickened by transpression along the fracture zones. Gravity inversion alone cannot discriminate between these possibilities. The cross-sections also show that, while ‘normal thickness’ oceanic crust ( c. 7 km) predominates regionally, local areas of thinner ( c. 5 km) and thicker ( c. 10 km) oceanic crust are also present along both margins. Finally, using maps of crustal thickness and thinning factor as input to plate reconstructions, the regional palaeogeography of the Equatorial Atlantic during and after break-up is displayed at 10 Ma increments.","[{""name"": ""Nick J.

In this article, I discern five major historiographical directions in contemporary scholarship regarding the history of knowledge. The analytical framework that has so far attracted the most attention is the circulation of knowledge. As productive as it is, the very concept of circulation is in need of both elaboration and theorization. In order to achieve this, I focus on the public circulation of knowledge. This kind of circulation implies that knowledge should be studied as a broad, societal phenomenon. There are a number of possible methodological approaches to study the processes, situations, or contexts where knowledge has or gains public significance. Here I focus on and develop the concept of public arenas of knowledge, which might be virtual, physical, or hybrid spaces. Drawing on several new studies, I demonstrate how different public arenas of knowledge functioned during the postwar period and how they were part of a larger infrastructure of knowledge.","[{""name"": ""JOHAN ÖSTLING"", ""affiliation"": [""Lund University""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Demography', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

A comparative perspective allows us to distinguish between those aspects of Irish policies and performance that were unique to the country, and those which mirrored developments elsewhere. While Irish performance was typical in the long run, the country under‐performed prior to the mid‐1980s and over‐performed for the rest of the twentieth century. Real growth after 2000 was slow. The mainly chronological narrative highlights the roles of convergence forces, trade and industrial policy, and monetary and fiscal policy. While the focus is mostly on the South of the island, we also survey the Northern Irish experience during this period.","[{""name"": ""Cormac Ó Gráda"", ""affiliation"": [""University College Dublin""]}, {""name"": ""Kevin Hjortshøj O'Rourke"", ""affiliation"": [""NYU Abu Dhabi""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00498.x"", ""10.1016/S0927-5371(02)00073-8"", ""10.1017/ihs.2018.34"", ""10.1111/1468-5965.00302"", ""10.1177/0332489317721406"", ""10.2307/2223275"", ""10.3318/isia.2021.32b.12"", ""10.1257/aer.102.2.810"", ""10.4324/9780203094952"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2006.00357.x"", ""10.1080/00076791.2014.977875"", ""10.1093/cje/bev077"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9485.1958.tb00371.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90182-4"", ""10.1023/B:JOEG.0000023015.44856.a9"", ""10.1177/033248939502200101"", ""10.1017/9781108334907"", ""10.2307/j.ctv64h6t9"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199663958.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1344467"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2012.10.003"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511758683.003"", ""10.1017/S0022050710000756"", ""10.7227/IESH.38.1"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719089510.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oep/55.3.512"", ""10.1093/ereh/heaa004"", ""10.7227/IESH.42.1.1"", ""10.1017/9781108680325"", ""10.1177/033248939802500104"", ""10.1353/eca.2002.0007"", ""10.4324/9780203404157"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139044554.006"", ""10.1093/ej/ueaa067"", ""10.1017/S0021121400010531"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199286881.003.0012"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198205982.001.0001"", ""10.1093/past/175.1.124"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511758683.014"", ""10.1017/S0022050700038997"", ""10.1177/0332489317735410"", ""10.1111/ehr.12664"", ""10.1017/S1361491602000011"", ""10.3386/w24701"", ""10.1093/oep/gpp041"", ""10.2307/1884499""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We look at how violence erupts after revelation of queer sexuality of one of the participants of collective drinking. Discussions of homosexuality in Russia became especially heated after the adoption of the bill against the “propaganda of non‐traditional family values” in 2013. This law primarily marks information about homosexuality as inappropriate and dangerous to minors. We review court decisions on violence against gay men before and after the introduction of this law. The court cases we analyze are not cases of the “propaganda” law enforcement, but routine violent felonies. As we selected only those cases that involve alcohol consumption from a larger sample, we analyze the stories told in these court files focusing on interaction rituals during the practice of collective heavy drinking. We demonstrate how this ritual is centered around confirmation of masculinity, ceremonies of sharing, and exchange of respect. We also show that these ritualized practices are interrupted and confused by introduction of information about one of the participants' queer sexuality. This interruption evolves into violent reactions, including murder. Nevertheless, the ritual of drinking supports both a “conversation of souls” (sharing intimate secrets) and violent reactions to the information that challenges masculinity of the ritual's participants.","[{""name"": ""ALEXANDER SASHA KONDAKOV"", ""affiliation"": [""Assistant Professor at the School of Sociology, University College Dublin, Ireland, and a researcher in the University of Helsinki's major research center in Russian and Eurasian studies, the Aleksanteri Institute, Finland.""]}, {""name"": ""EVGENY SHTORN"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent researcher from Dublin (Ireland).""]}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

U.S. operations in these two countries became the second- and fourth-largest in the world, creating migration links that resulted in the emergence of American universities, such as the University of Houston, as immigration hubs for the highly selective, student-led South Asian migration stream starting in the 1950s. By the late twentieth century, Houston’s South Asian community had become one of the most prosperous in the metropolitan area and one of the largest in the country. Mining archives and using new oral histories, Uzma Quraishi traces this pioneering community from its midcentury roots to the early twenty-first century, arguing that South Asian immigrants appealed to class conformity and endorsed the model minority myth to navigate the complexities of a shifting Sunbelt South.

Our semantics identifies false program dependencies that might be removed by compiler optimisation, and leaves in place just the dependencies necessary to rule out thin-air reads. We show that our dependency calculation can be used to rule out thin-air reads in any axiomatic concurrency model, in particular C++. We present a tool that automatically evaluates litmus tests, show that we can augment C++ to fix the thin-air problem, and we prove that our augmentation is compatible with the previously used compilation mappings over key processor architectures.

Law constituted a foundational building block of this process: Indian Ocean merchants drew on a deep well of legal concepts and forms as they attempted to make their worlds legible to one another, mobilizing the grammars of law to bridge commercial systems. We situate these dynamics within the context of the Indian Ocean ‘bazaar’, establishing it as a site for thinking about the place of cross-cultural trade in world history, and the histories of global capitalism more broadly. We suggest that Euro-American capitalism’s very agents had to adapt their commerce to the idioms, logics, and contracts of their business partners around the Indian Ocean – a vernacular world of the bazaar that was itself already in motion.","[{""name"": ""Fahad Bishara"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hollian Wint"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Thus, it is imperative to combine the strengths of verification tools via combinations and cooperation. CoVeriTeam is a language and tool for on-demand composition of cooperative approaches. It provides a systematic and modular way to combine existing tools (without changing them) in order to leverage their full potential. The idea of cooperative verification is that different tools help each other to achieve the goal of correctly solving verification tasks.The language is based on verification artifacts (programs, specifications, witnesses) as basic objects and verification actors (verifiers, validators, testers) as basic operations. We define composition operators that make it possible to easily describe new compositions. Verification artifacts are the interface between the different verification actors. CoVeriTeam consists of a language for composition of verification actors, and its interpreter.As a result of viewing tools as components, we can now create powerful verification engines that are beyond the possibilities of single tools, avoiding to develop certain components repeatedly. We illustrate the abilities of CoVeriTeam on a few case studies. We expect that CoVeriTeam will help verification researchers and practitioners to easily experiment with new tools, and assist them in rapid prototyping of tool combinations.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sudeep Kanav"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-540-24756-2_1"", ""10.1145/1965724.1965743"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45234-6_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950351"", ""10.1145/3477579"", ""10.1145/2786805.2786867"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92994-1_1"", ""10.1145/3510003.3510064"", ""10.1145/2393596.2393664"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16722-6_23"", ""10.1145/3180155.3180259"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5644953"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99429-7_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31784-3_11"", ""10.1145/2491411.2491429"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_1"", ""10.1109/69.43410"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-32759-9_13"", ""10.1007/10722167_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_3"", ""10.1145/567752.567778"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-35873-9_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54624-2_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46675-9_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2"", ""10.1126/science.275.5296.51"", ""10.1016/j.dam.2006.04.015"", ""10.1145/1138912.1138916"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-11486-1_14"", ""10.1016/S0065-2458(08)60520-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-30729-4_10"", ""10.1007/11576280_3"", ""10.1007/s100090050003""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

10.1017/S0018246X19000281,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,"WHITE ANTS, EMPIRE, AND ENTOMO-POLITICS IN SOUTH ASIA","AbstractBy focusing on the history of white ants in colonial South Asia, this article shows how insects were ubiquitous and fundamental to the shaping of British colonial power. British rule in India was vulnerable to white ants because these insects consumed paper and wood, the key material foundations of the colonial state. The white ant problem also made the colonial state more resilient and intrusive. The sphere of strict governmental intervention was extended to include both animate and inanimate non-humans, while these insects were invoked as symbols to characterize colonized landscapes, peoples, and cultures. Nonetheless, encounters with white ants were not entirely within the control of the colonial state. Despite effective state intervention, white ants did not vanish altogether, and remained objects of everyday control until the final decade of colonial rule and after. Meanwhile, colonized and post-colonial South Asians used white ants to articulate their own distinct political agendas. Over time, white ants featured variously as metaphors for Islamic decadence, British colonial exploitation, communism, democratic socialism, and, more recently, the Indian National Congress. This article argues that co-constitutive encounters between the worlds of insects and politics have been an intrinsic feature of British colonialism and its legacies in South Asia.","[{""name"": ""ROHAN DEB ROY"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.0066-4812.2005.00501.x"", ""10.1093/pastj/gts026"", ""10.1177/0309132510362932"", ""10.2307/2842302"", ""10.1080/09505431.2013.776367"", ""10.1215/08992363-2007-008"", ""10.1353/book.3317"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10492.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1478-0542.2011.00824.x"", ""10.1080/09505430020025492"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226164700.003.0006"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226703299.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0010417501003644"", ""10.1086/448839"", ""10.5962/bhl.title.153213"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtt026"", ""10.1017/S0018246X17000073"", ""10.4324/9780203762011"", ""10.1177/0096144212449145"", ""10.1038/026549f0"", ""10.1525/ah.2005.79.1.27"", ""10.1093/ahr/120.4.1218"", ""10.1111/hic3.12093"", ""10.1086/271693""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Anthropology', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

10.1017/S0738248020000528,LAW AND HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0301 Law,Turning a Blind Eye: Infanticide and Missing Babies in Seventeenth-Century Geneva,"Debates over constitutional originalism almost always center on meaning. Questions are typically focused, concentrated on the meaning of particular constitutional clauses at the moment of their inception: the Commerce Clause in 1787, the Second Amendment in 1791, or the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. Given the prevalence of these investigations, theoretical and methodological debates over how to recover original constitutional meaning are concentrated on either the kind of meaning that should be targeted—original public meaning, original intended meaning, or original legal meaning—or how that meaning can be recovered—through conventional legal reasoning, corpus linguistics, or thick reconstruction of historical context. Regardless, virtually all originalist theories of meaning uncritically presuppose the nature of the object possessing that meaning: they take as given what the Constitution itself is and, by implication, what it has always been. Although it might not be clear what the Constitution originally meant, it is straightforward what the original Constitution originally was. It just is the Constitution.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan Gienapp"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4159/9780674989542"", ""10.1017/S0738248019000427"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674726260.c7""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X20000254,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,THE COSMOPOLITAN HISTORIOGRAPHY OF TWENTIETH-CENTURY FEDERALISM,"AbstractThis article examines the historiographical debate over federalism between the 1930s and 1960s. In their most sweeping iterations, revisionists have sought to unravel the history of the nation-state, by using the history of anti-colonial federalist demands for equal incorporation into imperial states as evidence against a teleology of nationalist independence. In perceiving the democratic potentialities embedded within imperial state forms, revisionists argue that anti-colonial federalists therefore belong within a cosmopolitan tradition of seeking democratic supra-national governance beyond empire and nation. Some iterations of ‘post-colonial cosmopolitanism’ have unfortunately channelled debate into an opposition between federalism and nationalism, while also generating methodological republicanism, the tendency to view proto-republics within imperial formations. This review challenges these interpretive shortcomings and argues instead that federalism ought to be understood as part of a contest about the state as such. By integrating scholarship on French and British imperial federalism with recent work on regional federalisms in European and African contexts, this essay centres a whole range of ideological variations of ‘cosmopolitanism’ that adapted federalism to their critiques of the state. Ultimately, this reframing of federalist historiography enables new insights into contests about, and not just over, twentieth-century states.","[{""name"": ""MERVE FEJZULA"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3917/ving.083.0161"", ""10.1111/1467-6443.00039"", ""10.1353/imp.2018.0060"", ""10.1080/03086539808583029"", ""10.1215/1089201X-2773815"", ""10.2307/2078466"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtn015"", ""10.1080/09592296.2013.762881"", ""10.1515/9781400827978"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199588558.001.0001"", ""10.1215/1089201x-4133001"", ""10.1093/ehr/118.476.380"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139681001"", ""10.1525/9780520938618"", ""10.1080/13621020601099807"", ""10.1353/imp.2018.0059"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226235226.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0018246X18000407"", ""10.1017/S0960777303001462"", ""10.1525/9780520959903"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511614743"", ""10.1080/0140238042000283300"", ""10.1057/9781137028310"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226773858.001.0001"", ""10.1353/esp.2007.0026"", ""10.1080/03086530500412132"", ""10.1515/9781400829767"", ""10.1017/S0018246X18000158"", ""10.1017/S1479244312000194"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790645"", ""10.1017/S0021853708003915"", ""10.1017/S0080440117000123"", ""10.7312/moyn16048-008"", ""10.1017/S0165115300024578"", ""10.1515/9781400834709"", ""10.1215/9780822391982"", ""10.4159/9780674919808"", ""10.5040/9781350989108"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316418024.013"", ""10.1017/S0021853720000043"", ""10.1215/9780822375791"", ""10.1093/ahr/117.5.1461"", ""10.1177/0090591707310084"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139583732""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['History and Philosophy of Science', 'History']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

But instead of narrating a story of abstracted governmentality, this paper dives below the waves, braiding Tamil poetry with scientific material relating to the oyster and state sources concerning fishery administration. Taken together, these unearth a multi-species history of the human relationship to the seas. In the same way that pearl divers’ labour was a mode of knowing nature, so too, natural processes and marine creatures shaped, in turn, the economic, social and cultural worlds at the fishery. This nacreous, layered approach combines natural history, maritime labour and historical ecology to explore the fragile and interlocking balance below the waves which extended beyond humans to the molluscs, sharks, boring sponges and parasitic tapeworms of the Gulf of Mannar. The archive around the pearl fishery advances the animal and ecological histories of the Indian Ocean and also points towards ways of suturing the gulf between Indian and Sri Lankan scholarship.","[{""name"": ""Tamara Fernando"", ""affiliation"": [""Jesus College, Cambridge""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

However, their usefulness is hampered by their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Recently, many methods for measuring and improving a network’s robustness to adversarial perturbations have been proposed, and this growing body of research has given rise to numerous explicit or implicit notions of robustness. Connections between these notions are often subtle, and a systematic comparison between them is missing in the literature. In this paper we begin addressing this gap, by setting up general principles for the empirical analysis and evaluation of a network’s robustness as a mathematical property—during the network’s training phase, its verification, and after its deployment. We then apply these principles and conduct a case study that showcases the practical benefits of our general approach.","[{""name"": ""Marco Casadio"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ekaterina Komendantskaya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthew L.

Forest dynamics are closely related to climate change, natural disasters, and ecological diversity. The accumulated Landsat archive provides an unprecedented opportunity for long-term forest dynamics monitoring globally. However, using Landsat time series to detect small-scale and low-intensity disturbance events is still challenging since the moderate spatial resolution of Landsat images and the mixed pixel problem. Towards improving the ability of vegetation index (VI) in characterizing sub-pixel forest dynamics, this paper introduced the spectral mixture analysis (SMA) to develop a novel Pure Forest Index (PFI). The Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm was used to detect forest disturbance based on the PFI time series. Cross-comparison shows that PFI is far superior to other conventional VI in indicating forest conditions since it can enhance the spectral signal of the forest and suppress noises from the background. Time series analysis further demonstrates the superiority of PFI in accurately characterizing forest dynamics. The high overall accuracy of 0.96 for the forest disturbance map generated by the proposed approach was achieved. This study highlights a novel VI for accurately tracking subtle forest changes in a heterogeneous landscape.","[{""name"": ""Y. Cai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Q.

10.1108/HESWBL-05-2021-0104,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,Internships before and during COVID-19: experiences and perceptions of undergraduate interns and supervisors,"PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a contingent shift to remote working and learning worldwide. However, little is known regarding the impact of this shift on internships. Moreover, much of the available literature studies on internships are focused largely on perceptions by students, less so by supervisors. This paper describes the impact of COVID-19 on public health (PH) internships and examines interns' and supervisors' perspectives on their experiences in internships before and during the pandemic.Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional study design was conducted on two cohorts of undergraduate students and their supervisors in Singapore. Participants were surveyed using questionnaires with both close-ended and open-ended questions about various aspects of the internship experience. Data were triangulated from these surveys and module evaluation reports, and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively.FindingsCOVID-19 disrupted internships significantly, with a reduction in the number of placements offered and necessary changes to the internship scope. Overall, the internship experience has been positive. Supervisors and e-interns reported high levels of satisfaction and documented learning gains such as the development of technical skills and soft skills unique to remote work.Originality/valueThe study findings fill current gaps in the literature on supervisor perceptions and internship experiences during COVID-19. Recommendations are proposed to optimize e-internships, a potentially authentic workplace in the post-COVID era.","[{""name"": ""Cecilia Woon Chien Teng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raymond Boon Tar Lim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dana Wai Shin Chow"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Suganthi Narayanasamy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chee Hsiang Liow"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jeannette Jen-Mai Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30226-7"", ""10.1177/1529100615593273"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2020.104271"", ""10.1300/J001v05n04_04"", ""10.1108/ET-10-2016-0157"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.37074/jalt.2020.3.1.7"", ""10.1177/2373379916684850"", ""10.48009/3_iis_2020_11-19"", ""10.1108/00242531211267572"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.6.1524"", ""10.1108/IntR-11-2012-0226"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90500-6_17"", ""10.1108/JWAM-09-2019-0028"", ""10.3389/fpubh.2020.00182"", ""10.1080/10963758.2020.1726769"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02509.x"", ""10.5173/ceju.2020.0087"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0077-7"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v17i4.2385"", ""10.1044/2020_PERSP-20-00153"", ""10.1080/03075079.2016.1144181"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2958.2012.01428.x"", ""10.1007/s10671-012-9131-3"", ""10.1111/apps.12290"", ""10.1080/02678379408259982"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.26.1.64"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.643264""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Although folding of unlithified or ‘soft’ sediments is typically assumed to produce similar geometries to those in ‘hard rocks’, there has to date been little detailed analysis of such folds. The aim of this paper is therefore to investigate folds developed during soft-sediment deformation (SSD) by applying techniques established for the analysis of tectonic folds during hard-rock deformation (HRD). We use the Late Pleistocene Lisan Formation exposed around the Dead Sea as our case study, as the laminated lake sediments record intricacies of fold detail generated during seismically triggered slumping of mass transport deposits (MTDs) towards the depocentre of the basin. While it is frequently assumed that folds created during SSD are chaotic and form disharmonic structures, we provide analyses that show harmonic fold trains may form during slumping, although larger upright folds cannot be traced for significant distances and are more typically disharmonic. Our analysis also reveals a range of fold styles, with more competent detrital-rich layers displaying buckles (Class 1B), as well as upright Class 1A folds marked by thickened limbs. Class 1A buckle folds are generally considered to be created by flattening that overprints folds with an original Class 1B geometry. As thickened fold limbs are truncated by overlying erosive surfaces, the vertical flattening is considered to have occurred during the slump event. Different fold shapes may partially reflect variable flattening, depending on the original orientation of upright or recumbent folds, together with continued downslope-directed simple-shear deformation that modifies the fold geometry. Analysis of fold wavelength, amplitude and bed thickness allows us to plot strain contour maps, and indicates that beds defining slump folds display viscosity contrasts in the range of 50–250, which are similar to values estimated from folds created during HRD in metamorphic rocks. A range of refold patterns, similar to those established by John Ramsay in metamorphic rocks, are observed within slumps, and are truncated by the overlying sediments, indicating that they formed during a single progressive slump event rather than distinct ‘episodes’ of superimposed deformation. This study confirms that techniques developed for the analysis of folds created during HRD are equally applicable to those formed during SSD, and that resulting folds are generally indistinguishable from one another. Extreme caution should therefore be exercised when interpreting the origin of folds in the rock record where the palaeogeographical and tectonic contexts become increasingly uncertain, thereby leading to potential misidentification of folds created during SSD.","[{""name"": ""G.

Civil War–era African Americans recognized the urgency of a core political concern: how best to use the opportunity presented by this conflict over slavery to win abolition and secure enduring black rights, goals that had eluded earlier generations of black veterans. Some, like Frederick Douglass, urged immediate enlistment to support the cause of emancipation, hoping that a Northern victory would bring about the end of slavery. But others counseled patience and negotiation, drawing on a historical memory of unfulfilled promises for black military service in previous American wars and encouraging black men to leverage their position to demand abolition and equal citizenship. In doing this, they also began redefining what it meant to be a black man who fights for the United States. These debates over African Americans’ enlistment expose a formative moment in the development of American citizenship: black Northerners’ key demand was that military service earn full American citizenship, a term that had no precise definition prior to the Fourteenth Amendment. In articulating this demand, Taylor argues, black Northerners participated in the remaking of American citizenship itself—unquestionably one of the war’s most important results.","[{""name"": ""Brian Taylor"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

We document four alternating phases of inequality decline and growth. The Black Death (1347–1352) led to inequality decline, until about 1450. Thereafter, inequality rose steadily. The Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) and the 1627–1629 plague triggered a second phase of inequality reduction. This distinguishes Germany from other European areas where inequality grew monotonically. Inequality growth resumed from about 1700, well before the Industrial Revolution. Our findings offer new material to current debates on the determinants of inequality change in western societies, past and present.","[{""name"": ""Guido Alfani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Victoria Gierok"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Felix Schaff"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11698-016-0152-7"", ""10.1017/S1744137420000508"", ""10.1086/498123"", ""10.1257/jel.20201640"", ""10.1257/jep.29.1.67"", ""10.4159/9780674969797"", ""10.1017/S0018246X00025875"", ""10.3886/E144241V1"", ""10.1017/S0022050719000378"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511665141"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2018.09.002"", ""10.1017/S0025727300067703"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496943"", ""10.1515/9781400831883"", ""10.1524/9783050060514"", ""10.25162/9783515124454"", ""10.1017/S0022050717000092"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511497230"", ""10.1093/gerhis/ghaa012"", ""10.1515/9781400829828"", ""10.7788/boehlau.9783412319441.151"", ""10.1111/ehr.12071"", ""10.1111/ehr.12122"", ""10.1007/s11698-016-0154-5"", ""10.1007/s11698-016-0151-8"", ""10.1017/S0022050715001539"", ""10.1017/S0022050721000358"", ""10.7788/boehlau.9783412218287"", ""10.1515/9781400884605"", ""10.1515/jbwg-2019-0009"", ""10.1017/S0022050701025086"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-07738-7"", ""10.1111/ehr.12576"", ""10.1162/jinh.2010.40.4.513"", ""10.1057/9781137289773"", ""10.1515/9781400880348"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2016.07.003"", ""10.1093/ereh/het013"", ""10.1093/ereh/hev018"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198706083.003.0006"", ""10.1515/9783110506761"", ""10.1257/jel.20191449"", ""10.2307/2598128"", ""10.1093/ereh/heaa026"", ""10.1111/ehr.12471"", ""10.1080/00324720903448712"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199276561.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2010.09.004"", ""10.4324/9781315149271-2"", ""10.4159/9780674369542""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

Where a trace property defines a set of traces, a hyperproperty defines a set of sets of traces. The temporal logics HyperLTL and HyperCTL* have been proposed to express hyperproperties. However, their semantics aresynchronousin the sense that all traces proceed at the same speed and are evaluated at the same position. This precludes the use of these logics to analyze systems whose traces can proceed at different speeds and allow that different traces take stuttering steps independently. To solve this problem in this paper, we propose anasynchronousvariant of HyperLTL. On the negative side, we show that the model-checking problem for this variant is undecidable. On the positive side, we identify a decidable fragment which covers a rich set of formulas with practical applications. We also propose two model-checking algorithms that reduce our problem to the HyperLTL model-checking problem in the synchronous semantics.","[{""name"": ""Jan Baumeister"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Norine Coenen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Borzoo Bonakdarpour"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bernd Finkbeiner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""César Sánchez"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0020-0190(85)90056-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-88313-5_22"", ""10.1145/512644.512660"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_33"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03421-4_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_15"", ""10.3233/JCS-2009-0393"", ""10.1109/LICS.2019.8785713"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_3"", ""10.1109/SP.1982.10014"", ""10.1145/3434319"", ""10.1145/78969.78972"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72016-2_6"", ""10.1145/567446.567463"", ""10.1007/978-1-4612-4222-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-39322-9_1"", ""10.1109/SFCS.1977.32"", ""10.1007/BFb0054170"", ""10.1090/S0002-9904-1946-08555-9"", ""10.1023/A:1011553200337"", ""10.1145/3358232""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1093/pastj/gtab012,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,Vernacular Discourses Of Gender Equality In The Post-War British Working Class*,"Abstract Why did women’s roles change so dramatically in the West in the period after 1945? These years saw major changes in those roles, and in dominant understandings of female selfhood, from a model based on self-abnegation to one based on self-fulfilment. The roots of this shift have often been located in the post-1968 feminist movement and in economic change. Examining this question through the lens of Great Britain, this article, however, centres working-class women as drivers of these changes, drawing on oral history interviews with over 100 women from coalfield communities. In the decades after 1950, these women constructed a new vernacular discourse of gender equality which had profound implications for the position of women in society. This vernacular discourse shared some similarities with post-1968 feminism, but rather than focusing on the division of domestic and paid labour, or sexual violence, it emphasized women’s autonomy, individuality and voice. In constructing it, working-class women drew on pervasive post-war ideas about equality and democracy, discourses of individualism and individual fulfilment, and discourses of ‘companionate’ marriage and ‘child-centred’ parenting in order to make claims for women’s rights. Through doing so, they constructed women not only as wives and mothers, but also as free and equal individuals.","[{""name"": ""Florence Sutcliffe-Braithwaite"", ""affiliation"": [""University College London""]}, {""name"": ""Natalie Thomlinson"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Reading""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Point cloud data of indoor scenes is primarily composed of planar-dominant elements. Automatic shape segmentation is thus valuable to avoid labour intensive labelling. This paper provides a fully unsupervised region growing segmentation approach for efficient clustering of massive 3D point clouds. Our contribution targets a low-level grouping beneficial to object-based classification. We argue that the use of relevant segments for object-based classification has the potential to perform better in terms of recognition accuracy, computing time and lowers the manual labelling time needed. However, fully unsupervised approaches are rare due to a lack of proper generalisation of user-defined parameters. We propose a self-learning heuristic process to define optimal parameters, and we validate our method on a large and richly annotated dataset (S3DIS) yielding 88.1% average F1-score for object-based classification. It permits to automatically segment indoor point clouds with no prior knowledge at commercially viable performance and is the foundation for efficient indoor 3D modelling in cluttered point clouds.","[{""name"": ""F.

Despite the basic perception of mining being unsustainable, there has been a radical shift in thinking about mining and sustainable development in recent decades, led by the introduction of numerous guidelines, schemes and protocols to address specific issues and improve reporting and accountability by mines and mining companies – in simple terms, using certification-type schemes to justify a sustainable or responsible approach to mining based on more ethical underpinnings. This chapter presents a unique and concise synthesis of these complex issues and outlines how mining can be described as responsible, sustainable or perhaps ethical even – or not as the case may be.","[{""name"": ""Gavin M.

10.1093/shm/hkz007,SOCIAL HISTORY OF MEDICINE,0603 World History; 0712 History of Science and Technology,No Man's Land? Gendering Contraception in Family Planning Advice Literature in State-Socialist Poland (1950s-1980s),"Summary This article examines popular medical discourses on contraception produced in state-socialist Poland following the legalisation of abortion in 1956, a time when the party state declared family planning to be a public health project. By analysing popular medical literature, I argue that the popularisation of family planning constructed and relied on gender norms that could ease anxieties about the mainstreaming of ideas relating to sexuality and contraception, as well as about gender equality in a state-socialist context. I show that the femininity constructed in Polish birth control advice was based in fertility and the physical attractiveness required to maintain a husband’s sexual interest. Although masculinity was represented as distant, egoistic and violent, experts broadcast mixed messages about the effectiveness and usefulness of popular male contraceptive methods, some of which were at times utterly demonised.","[{""name"": ""Agata Ignaciuk"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

A sustainability viewpoint on psychological capital and life well-being of management graduates,"PurposeWell-being and employability are considered important indicators of a sustainable career that must be incorporated into the system at the beginning of a job. Hence, it is essential to explore the role of positive personal resources to improve young managers' well-being. The unending ambivalence in the academic environment and the job market is detrimental to management graduates' well-being. The study aims to look into the possible intervening methods to enhance the well-being of management students during difficult times.Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional study was conducted among 212 management students from Kerala, India. Multi-stage random sampling was used to collect data. Structural equation modelling using IBM-AMOS was done to gain insights into the proposed relationships.FindingsThe results indicated that psychological capital had a significant impact on the well-being of management students. Both perceived employability and psychological capital are positively related to life well-being. And, perceived employability mediated the relationship between psychological capital and life well-being.Research limitations/implicationsThe theoretical contribution comes from the application of the broaden-and-build theory and resource caravans from the conservation of resource theory as a theoretical framework to understand the positive impact of developing psychological capital among university students. The practical contribution comes from identifying a need for universities to make their campus climate more supportive of the non-academic needs of students by supporting them to become more self-reliant and enhance their positive psychological resources. Developing psychological resources of perceived employability and psychological capital is quintessential to enhance life well-being and career sustainability of early careers talent.Originality/valueThis study is one of the first attempts to discern how psychological capital leads to an accumulation of psychological resources and life well-being in university students and graduates offering opportunities for career sustainability.","[{""name"": ""Nimmi P.

Our method starts with applying the DeepPoly abstract domain to analyze the network. If the robustness property cannot be verified, the result is inconclusive. Due to the over-approximation, the computed region in the abstraction may be spurious in the sense that it does not contain any true counterexample. Our goal is to identify such spurious regions and use them to guide the abstraction refinement. The core idea is to make use of the obtained constraints of the abstraction to infer new bounds for the neurons. This is achieved by linear programming techniques. With the new bounds, we iteratively apply DeepPoly, aiming to eliminate spurious regions. We have implemented our approach in a prototypical tool DeepSRGR. Experimental results show that a large amount of regions can be identified as spurious, and as a result, the precision of DeepPoly can be significantly improved. As a side contribution, we show that our approach can be applied to verify quantitative robustness properties.","[{""name"": ""Pengfei Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Renjue Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jianlin Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cheng-Chao Huang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jingyi Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jun Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bai Xue"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lijun Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_5"", ""10.1007/10722167_15"", ""10.1145/512950.512973"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-77935-5_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_3"", ""10.1109/SP.2018.00058"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02658-4_47"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26"", ""10.1109/5.726791"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-32304-2_15"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.01168"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/368"", ""10.1007/s10916-014-0110-5"", ""10.1038/nature16961"", ""10.1145/3290354"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30942-8_39"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2019.00126"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_22""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Software', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

The health assessment of strategic infrastructures and bridges represents a critical variable for planning appropriate maintenance operations. The high costs and complexity of traditional periodical monitoring with elevating platforms have driven the search for more efficient and flexible methods. Indeed, recent years have seen the growing diffusion and adoption of non-invasive approaches consisting in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for applications that range from visual inspection with optical sensors to LiDAR technologies for rapid mapping of the territory. This study defines two different methodologies for bridge inspection. A first approach involving the integration of traditional topographic and GNSS techniques with TLS and photogrammetry with cameras mounted on UAV was compared with a UAV-LiDAR method based on the use of a DJI Matrice 300 equipped with a LiDAR DJI Zenmuse L1 sensor for a manual flight and an automatic one. While the first workflow resulted in a centimetric accurate but time-consuming model, the UAV-LiDAR resulting point cloud’s georeferencing accuracy resulted to be less accurate in the case of the manual flight under the bridge for GNSS signal obstruction. However, a photogrammetric model reconstruction phase made with Ground Control Points and photos taken by the L1-embedded camera improved the overall accuracy of the workflow, that could be employed for flexible low-cost mapping of bridges when medium level accuracy (5–10 cm) is accepted. In conclusion, a solution for integrating interactively final 3D products in a Bridge Management System environment is presented.","[{""name"": ""F. Gaspari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F.

10.1111/hith.12163,HISTORY AND THEORY,0603 World History,"HOW THE VISUAL IS SPATIAL: CONTEMPORARY SPATIAL HISTORY, NEO-MARXISM, AND THE GHOST OF BRAUDEL","ABSTRACTThis essay has two objectives. First, it seeks to engage critically with contemporary scholarship on the origins of racism through the lens of an older debate centered around the history of ideas. Specifically, it argues that Quentin Skinner's influential critique of the history of ideas can help identify the pitfalls of our current fascination with the origins of racism—most particularly when such origins are traced back to antiquity and the European pre‐ and early modern periods. In pursuing its second objective, the essay turns from histories cataloguing ancient, medieval, and early modern racisms to objections leveled, in these same literatures, against scholarship defending the modernity of race. The defense of a premodern origin to race is, I argue, not just a historical argument but a contemporary politics embedded in a narrative of continuity that insists on the relevance of the medieval past to the racial configurations of our current moment. Rather than demonstrating continuity and sameness, this essay seeks to draw attention to alternative modes of historicizing that are more attentive to the alterity of the past.","[{""name"": ""VANITA SETH"", ""affiliation"": [""University of California, Santa Cruz""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

U–Pb zircon ages reveal three stages of plutonism including: (i) sparse 3.2 Ga granodiorite plutons intruding the TTG (tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite) basement away from the western boundary of the Nagamangala greenstone belt; (ii) 3.0 Ga monzogranite to quartz monzonite plutons adjoining the Nagamangala greenstone belt; and (iii) 2.6 Ga monzogranite plutons in the Pandavpura region. Elemental data of the 3.2 Ga granodiorite indicate their origin through the melting of mafic protoliths without any significant residual garnet. Moderate to poorly fractionated REE patterns of 3.0 Ga plutons with negative Eu anomalies and Nd isotope data with ε Nd (T) = 3.0 Ga ranging from −1.7 to +0.5 indicate the involvement of a major crustal source with minor mantle input. Melts derived from those two components interacted through mixing and mingling processes. Poorly fractionated REE patterns with negative Eu anomalies of 2.6 Ga plutons suggest plagioclase in residue. The presence of magmatic epidote in all of the plutons points to their rapid emplacement and crystallization at about 5 kbars. The 3.2 Ga intrusions could correspond to reworking associated with a major juvenile crust-forming episode, whilst 3.0 Ga potassic granites correspond to cratonization linked to melting of the deep crust. The 2.6 Ga Pandavpura granite could represent lower-crustal melting and final cratonization, as 2.5 Ga plutons are absent in the WDC.","[{""name"": ""M.

This image captures the interwar period's great conflict of ideologies, the international interconnectedness of the age and the aestheticisation of political and ideological conflict in the age of mass media and mass spectacle. [Figure 1] Last but not least, it captures the importance in the 1930s of what we now call cultural diplomacy. Both pavilions – Germany's, in Albert Speer's neo-classical tower bloc crowned with a giant swastika, and the Soviet Union's, housed in Boris Iofan's forward-thrusting structure topped by Vera Mukhina's monumental sculptural group – represented the outcome of a large-scale collaboration between political leaders and architects, artists, intellectuals and graphic and industrial designers seeking to present their country to foreign visitors in a manner designed to advance the country's interests in the international arena. Each pavilion, that is, made an outreach that wasdiplomatic– in the sense that it sought to mediate between distinct polities – using means that werecultural– in the sense that they deployed refined aesthetic practices (like the arts and architecture) and in the sense that they highlighted the distinctive features, or ‘culture’, of a particular group (like the German nation or the Soviet state).","[{""name"": ""Benjamin G.

Evyn Lê Espiritu Gandhi analyzes these two cases to theorize what she calls the refugee settler condition: the fraught positionality of refugee subjects whose resettlement in a settler colonial state is predicated on the unjust dispossession of an Indigenous population. This groundbreaking book explores two forms of critical geography: first, archipelagos of empire, examining how the Vietnam War is linked to the US military buildup in Guam and unwavering support of Israel, and second, corresponding archipelagos of trans-Indigenous resistance, tracing how Chamorro decolonization efforts and Palestinian liberation struggles are connected through the Vietnamese refugee figure. Considering distinct yet overlapping modalities of refugee and Indigenous displacement, Gandhi offers tools for imagining emergent forms of decolonial solidarity between refugee settlers and Indigenous peoples.","[{""name"": ""Evyn Lê Espiritu Gandhi"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

We implement and evaluate this algorithm and related heuristics in the Z3 theorem prover. A crucial insight that underpins our algorithm is that real-world regex and string formulas contain a wealth of information about upper and lower bounds on lengths of strings, and such information can be used very effectively to simplify operations on automata representing regular expressions. Additionally, we present a number of novel general heuristics, such as the prefix/suffix method, that can be used to make a variety of regex solving algorithms more efficient in practice. We showcase the power of our algorithm and heuristics via an extensive empirical evaluation over a large and diverse benchmark of 57256 regex-heavy instances, almost 75% of which are derived from industrial applications or contributed by other solver developers. Our solver outperforms five other state-of-the-art string solvers, namely, CVC4, OSTRICH, Z3seq, Z3str3, and Z3-Trau, over this benchmark, in particular achieving a speedup of 2.4$$\times $$×over CVC4, 4.4$$\times $$×over Z3seq, 6.4$$\times $$×over Z3-Trau, 9.1$$\times $$×over Z3str3, and 13$$\times $$×over OSTRICH.","[{""name"": ""Murphy Berzish"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mitja Kulczynski"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Federico Mora"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Florin Manea"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joel D.

10.1111/hith.12209,HISTORY AND THEORY,0603 World History,3. LAW AND THE TIME OF ANGELS: INTERNATIONAL LAW'S METHOD WARS AND THE AFFECTIVE LIFE OF DISCIPLINES,"ABSTRACTRecent method wars in international legal scholarship turn on the problem of law in time. Rejecting historians' focus on context and their “policing of anachronism,” prominent legal scholars like Anne Orford and Martti Koskenniemi have argued that the workings of modern law are not governed by the narrow strictures of sequential chronology and that legal scholars require alternate methods that reflect law's transfer of meaning through time. Contextualism, in this reckoning, represents a misguided methodological straightjacket that stifles critique by quarantining meaning and power in discrete historical silos; the embrace of anachronism, conversely, would foster a revitalized history of international law intimately connected with the political imperatives of the present. This essay uses the debate as an opening into a fuller exploration of law in history and in time. In considering the idiosyncratic way law frames time, sequence, and duration, it explores the connection between law's transtemporal transfers and its very mode of reproduction. To speak of law's capacity to escape context and travel through time is another way of describing its normativity: the laws of the past that survive to exert a normative force in the present are not, in their law‐ness, past—they are simply present law. The essay suggests some ways to make that temporality itself the object of analysis (rather than naturalizing and affirming it, as Orford has, or, conversely, dismissing it as bad history, as some historians have). It draws on the history of science to generate an account of law's temporal habitus as a disciplinary knowledge tool, a kind of epistemic virtue that is intimately involved in law's internal criteria for truth and falsity.","[{""name"": ""NATASHA WHEATLEY"", ""affiliation"": [""Princeton University""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History', 'Anthropology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1108/HESWBL-09-2020-0221,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,"""You are not as localised as I need"": employability of Chinese returning graduates","PurposeInternational student employability has been accorded increased emphasis in the internationalisation agendas, especially in major destination countries as it shapes universities' attractiveness to prospective international students. Having insights into returning graduates' employability in their home country has become critical given that a majority of international graduates return home after their overseas study. This study responds to this critical need by examining how foreign credentials are valued by employers in the field of accounting in China, based on in-depth interviews with employers, alumni and policymakers.Design/methodology/approachThis study draws on a qualitative approach involving literature review and in-depth interviews with 28 key stakeholders: employers, returning graduates and policymakers in China and India. The key research question of the study is how foreign credentials are valued by employers in the field of accounting in China and India. This article focuses on the Chinese context. In-depth interviews with employers and policymakers focused on eliciting nuanced socio-cultural understandings as to perceptions and decisions associated with desirable graduate attributes and the relative value of credentials. Interviews with returning graduates aimed to understand how different capitals were mobilised to gain employment in the Chinese labour market.FindingsThe empirical findings of the study show that Chinese returning graduates could be seen to lack the localised knowledge needed to work in Chinese companies and ability to adapt to the local environment. However the possible development of a dual local and international guanxi through overseas study can be regarded as a marker of distinction in the home labour market. The associated value of such a dual guanxi signals the importance for Chinese international students to develop transnational networks while simultaneously maintaining their kinship, social and business networks locally during their overseas education.Originality/valueThe study provides fresh insights into a marked shift in China, with less of a preference for Western credentials, as compared to 10 years ago when overseas credentials were often regarded more favourably. Even though overseas study generally provides Chinese graduates with an exposure to international practices and global perspectives, whether such an overseas exposure and foreign language competency would be an advantage also depends on the business needs and sometimes the business model of organisations.","[{""name"": ""Ly Thi Tran"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jill Blackmore"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Rahimi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1028315309348736"", ""10.1080/17508487.2015.1117505"", ""10.1080/00224545.1980.9924253"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.521"", ""10.1177/0002764215580586"", ""10.1007/s12134-018-0576-y"", ""10.1080/1360080X.2012.689181"", ""10.1177/0117196815621806"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-78492-2_11"", ""10.2457/srs.43.61"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2016.05.004"", ""10.1177/1028315310365541"", ""10.1177/0268580912453729"", ""10.1080/14747731.2011.622458"", ""10.1080/09639280902888229"", ""10.1080/01425692.2015.1044070"", ""10.1080/03057925.2020.1837613"", ""10.1080/14767724.2020.1789449"", ""10.1177/2455133315612310"", ""10.1080/13639080.2010.534774"", ""10.1080/14767724.2015.1026249"", ""10.1057/s41307-020-00185-y""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Education', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

For (finite-state) hardware, temporal hyperproperties are supported by model checking algorithms, and tools for general temporal logics like HyperLTL exist. For (infinite-state) software, the analysis of temporal hyperproperties has, so far, been limited tok-safety properties, i.e., properties that stipulate the absence of a bad interaction between anyktraces. In this paper, we present an automated method for the verification of$$\forall ^k\exists ^l$$∀k∃l-safety properties in infinite-state systems. A$$\forall ^k\exists ^l$$∀k∃l-safety property stipulates that for anyktraces, thereexistltraces such that the resulting$$k+l$$k+ltraces do not interact badly. This combination of universal and existential quantification enables us to express many properties beyondk-safety, including, for example, generalized non-interference or program refinement. Our method is based on a strategy-based instantiation of existential trace quantification combined with a program reduction, both in the context of a fixed predicate abstraction. Notably, our framework allows for mutual dependence of strategy and reduction.","[{""name"": ""Raven Beutner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bernd Finkbeiner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0304-3975(91)90224-P"", ""10.1109/LICS.2004.1319611"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-74407-8_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_42"", ""10.1007/11513988_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-35722-0_3"", ""10.1017/S0960129511000193"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_33"", ""10.1145/964001.964003"", ""10.1051/ita:2002013"", ""10.1145/3531130.3533369"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.CONCUR.2021.24"", ""10.1109/CSF54842.2022.9919658"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2206.03381"", ""10.1145/2535838.2535860"", ""10.1109/LICS52264.2021.9470583"", ""10.1109/TSE.2004.22"", ""10.1145/2240236.2240262"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314596"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_15"", ""10.1109/CSF.2008.7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_3"", ""10.1145/3324783"", ""10.1145/3158149"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_3"", ""10.1007/s13389-016-0141-6"", ""10.1007/3-540-63166-6_10"", ""10.1145/3434319"", ""10.1145/503272.503279"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_15"", ""10.1145/361227.361234"", ""10.1109/SECPRI.1988.8110"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1145/75277.75293"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94111-0_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_9"", ""10.1145/2908080.2908092"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_35"", ""10.1109/FMCAD.2014.6987617""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Nation-Building in Russia After 1991,"AbstractRussia’s post-1991 nation-building project has been torn between competing interpretations of national identity. Whereas the other former Soviet republics opted for nation-building centered on the titular nation, Russia’s approach to national identity was framed by the fact that the RSFSR had been definednotas a designated national homeland but as a multi-ethnic federation. This, coupled with Russia’s definition as the legal successor of the Soviet Union, suggesting continuity and a history of uninterrupted statehood, has enabled a range of rivaling understandings of how to define the “nation.” Focusing on top-down official nation-building, this article examines how, against a backdrop of shifting political contexts, structural constraints, and popular attitudes, the Kremlin has gradually revised its understanding of what constitutes the “Russian nation.” Four models for post-Soviet Russian nation-building are identified – the ethnic, the multi-national, the civic, and the imperial. Over time, the correlation of forces among these has shifted. The article concludes that, despite some claims of an ethno-nationalist turn after 2014, the Kremlin still employs nationalism instrumentally: National identity has undoubtedly become morerusskii-centered, but, at the same time, the Kremlin keeps the definition of “Russianness” intentionally vague, blurring the boundaries between “nation” and “civilization.”","[{""name"": ""Helge Blakkisrud"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/08913819608443417"", ""10.1017/nps.2019.125"", ""10.1016/j.euras.2010.04.001"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2015.1076959"", ""10.4324/9780429426773"", ""10.1515/9781474433877-014"", ""10.1080/1060586X.1997.10641441"", ""10.2753/PPC1075-8216610202"", ""10.1080/01419870120112049"", ""10.2753/RUP1061-1940500503"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598876"", ""10.1080/00905992.2014.917075"", ""10.1080/10758216.2015.1113884"", ""10.1017/nps.2020.40"", ""10.1080/09668136.2011.547693"", ""10.2753/RUP1061-1940470202"", ""10.1057/9780230101234"", ""10.1080/21599165.2014.956925"", ""10.4324/9780203465660"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511550348"", ""10.1080/01419870600665409"", ""10.2747/1060-586X.26.4.314"", ""10.4324/9781003045977"", ""10.1080/23761199.2016.1183396"", ""10.1080/10758216.2020.1752732"", ""10.1177/0010414002035005003"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558764"", ""10.1177/03058298990280031101"", ""10.4324/9781003045977-2"", ""10.3200/DEMO.18.2.101-121"", ""10.1017/slr.2018.290"", ""10.1080/10758216.2016.1225264"", ""10.1080/09668139808412578"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1547040"", ""10.1111/russ.12107"", ""10.1017/nps.2020.83"", ""10.1017/nps.2020.8"", ""10.1057/9780230604216"", ""10.1080/21599165.2015.1035779"", ""10.1111/nana.12366"", ""10.7829/j.ctvh8r0nq"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2009.10.008"", ""10.1515/9781474433877-016"", ""10.1080/09668136.2014.988999"", ""10.1080/00905990500088578"", ""10.1177/0967010695026001005""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/hic3.12619,HISTORY COMPASS,0603 World History,Making sense of the ruins: The historiography of deindustrialisation and its continued relevance in neoliberal times,"AbstractThe political upheavals of recent years, including Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, have increased scholarly and public interest in the impact of deindustrialisation on working‐class communities. Building upon earlier literature reviews, this historiographical study examines the continued flowering of this interdisciplinary, transnational field of research. After briefly recounting the emergence of the field in response to the structural transformations of the 1970s and 80s, and its subsequent ‘cultural turn’, this review focuses on identifying the most promising strands of contemporary English‐language research. It notes the particularly innovative attempts to identify the ‘moral economy’ of deindustrialising societies, the growing study of the long‐term cultural legacies or ‘half‐life’ of deindustrialisation, and the renewed focus on the politics of memory and heritage preservation. Finally, it considers how scholars can constructively respond to the increasing public interest in deindustrialisation, challenge racialised and exclusionary definitions of the working‐class, and unpick the historical relationship between deindustrialisation and the social and political transformations of recent times.","[{""name"": ""Christopher Lawson"", ""affiliation"": [""University of California Berkeley""]}]","[""10.1080/13619462.2017.1401476"", ""10.1080/000368498326100"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1850gh6"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791109"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12317"", ""10.1080/0023656X.2019.1681643"", ""10.17848/9780880994774.ch8"", ""10.17848/9780880994774.ch10"", ""10.1017/S0960777319000298"", ""10.1080/13619462.2020.1716732"", ""10.1080/00076791.2014.977875"", ""10.1177/1750698017741931"", ""10.17848/9780880994774.ch3"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511522178"", ""10.1080/09639489.2011.610164"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbu041"", ""10.7591/9781501723568"", ""10.1080/13602365.2013.804855"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-46297-8_4"", ""10.4324/9780203505113"", ""10.1080/13619462.2017.1408542"", ""10.1016/j.jhg.2017.11.004"", ""10.1353/jsh.2006.0079"", ""10.1093/wentk/9780190861414.001.0001"", ""10.1017/eso.2017.25"", ""10.1179/2051453013Z.0000000008"", ""10.7312/hack19372"", ""10.3138/9781442620902"", ""10.1017/S0147547913000276"", ""10.1111/hic3.12099"", ""10.3138/9781442686229"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbz003"", ""10.4324/9781315735962"", ""10.7591/9780801464058"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195045086.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0963926816000730"", ""10.1057/9780230353916_1"", ""10.3998/mpub.8432351"", ""10.1057/9781137283146"", ""10.1093/jeg/lbu015"", ""10.1080/00343404.2015.1136410"", ""10.1002/9780470773727"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-34117-4"", ""10.59962/9780774834957-003"", ""10.3917/vin.144.0098"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226560144.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12329"", ""10.7765/9781526124890"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12365"", ""10.9783/9780812292893"", ""10.2307/134710"", ""10.7591/9781501724695"", ""10.1017/S0147547913000252"", ""10.1080/13619462.2011.597550"", ""10.1017/S0147547913000264"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwu067"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwz005"", ""10.4159/9780674369542"", ""10.4159/9780674245075"", ""10.1080/13562576.2013.817513"", ""10.1017/S0147547913000343"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1480999"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwx006"", ""10.1007/s10887-015-9122-3"", ""10.17848/9780880994774.ch6"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198836407.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400844173"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5cg8m6"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199931460.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13619462.2017.1408532"", ""10.1111/soc4.12143"", ""10.1093/past/50.1.76"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2281.2010.00544.x"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwv030"", ""10.1017/9781139381611"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1361544"", ""10.1057/9780230359192"", ""10.1111/amet.12473"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00009410"", ""10.1525/9780520967205"", ""10.1504/IJMCP.2014.063847""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

The development of increasingly powerful Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is progressing continuously, so that these systems equipped with high-resolution sensors can be used for a variety of different applications. With the Matrice 300 RTK, Da-Jiang Innovations Science and Technology Co. Ltd (DJI) has launched a system that can use the high-resolution camera Zenmuse P1 or the laser scanner Zenmuse L1 as a recording sensor, among other sensors. In order to investigate the geometric quality of these two sensors, HafenCity University Hamburg, in cooperation with LGV Hamburg, NLWKN in Norden and the German Archaeological Institute in Bonn, flew over the 3D test field in the Inselpark in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg on 5 August 2021 with the P1 camera and the L1 laser scanner. Using the Matrice 300 RTK as carrier platform, the test field was recorded in various configurations at altitudes between 50 m and 90 m above ground. Prior to the UAV flight campaign, 44 marked ground control points (GCP) were signalised in the test field, which had already been surveyed by LGV in 2020 using geodetic measurement methods to achieve a coordinate accuracy of ±5 mm for each GCP.

How fiscally extractive were they? What was their capacity to provide public goods and services? And did this change in the “developmentalist” era of colonialism? To answer these questions, we use archival sources to build a new dataset on colonial states of the second French colonial empire (1830–1962). French colonial states extracted a substantial amount of revenue, but they were under-administered because public expenditure entailed high wage costs. These costs remained a strong constraint in the “developmentalist” era of colonialism, despite a dramatic increase in fiscal capacity and large overseas subsidies.","[{""name"": ""Denis Cogneau"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yannick Dupraz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sandrine Mesplé-Somps"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199661527.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S002185371400036X"", ""10.1017/S0022050715000637"", ""10.3406/cea.1973.2710"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a097197"", ""10.3886/E133361V1"", ""10.3406/tiers.1962.1090"", ""10.1080/20780389.2016.1261630"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511800290"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674074637"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wr2vx"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511523861"", ""10.3406/remmm.1993.2570"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9957.1954.tb00021.x"", ""10.4000/civilisations.1717"", ""10.1093/0195139690.001.0001"", ""10.1111/roiw.12037"", ""10.5089/9781616357825.001"", ""10.1017/S1740022810000227"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2010.10.002"", ""10.1257/app.1.2.176"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511584091"", ""10.1017/S0022050719000299"", ""10.4159/9780674369306"", ""10.1787/9789264104143-en"", ""10.1111/ehr.12820"", ""10.1017/S0020859017000177"", ""10.4159/9780674986213"", ""10.1017/9781108665001"", ""10.3917/droz.saul.2016.01"", ""10.1017/S0022050714000011"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139004237"", ""10.1017/S002205071500114X"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(97)00010-7"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000049""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Demography', 'History']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

As much of daily life migrates online, broadband—high-speed internet connectivity—has become a necessity. The widespread lack of broadband in rural America has created a stark urban–rural digital divide. In Farm Fresh Broadband, Christopher Ali analyzes the promise and the failure of national rural broadband policy in the United States and proposes a new national broadband plan. He examines how broadband policies are enacted and implemented, explores business models for broadband providers, surveys the technologies of rural broadband, and offers case studies of broadband use in the rural Midwest. Ali argues that rural broadband policy is both broken and incomplete: broken because it lacks coordinated federal leadership and incomplete because it fails to recognize the important roles of communities, cooperatives, and local providers in broadband access. For example, existing policies favor large telecommunication companies, crowding out smaller, nimbler providers. Lack of competition drives prices up—rural broadband can cost 37 percent more than urban broadband. The federal government subsidizes rural broadband by approximately $6 billion. Where does the money go? Ali proposes democratizing policy architecture for rural broadband, modeling it after the wiring of rural America for electricity and telephony. Subsidies should be equalized, not just going to big companies. The result would be a multistakeholder system, guided by thoughtful public policy and funded by public and private support.","[{""name"": ""Christopher Ali"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Engineering'],['Media Technology'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"

If Ukraine stops fighting, there will be no Ukraine’ is the sentiment used by Ukrainian protesters mobilising against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Such a sentiment signifies the stakes of a war where Ukraine is a democratic nation‐state fighting for its right to exist against a Russian invasion. Meanwhile, Russia is fighting for a version of Ukraine that is subservient to Russia's idea of what Ukraine should be as a nation‐state: under a Russian hegemon geopolitically, where Ukraine's national idea and interpretation of history can be vetted and vetoed by the Russian state. While nationalism scholarship equips us to study Russia's war against Ukraine through the lens of Russian ethnic nationalism and Ukrainian civic nationalism, the ethnic/civic dichotomy falls short of unpacking the more pernicious logics that pervade Russia's intentions and actions towards Ukraine (demilitarisation and de‐Nazification). Instead, this article explores the logics of Russia's war and Ukraine's resistance through the concept of existential nationalism where existential nationalism is Russia's motivation to pursue war, whatever the costs, and Ukraine's motivation to fight with everything it has.","[{""name"": ""Eleanor Knott"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Methodology LSE  London United Kingdom""]}]","[""10.1080/09668136.2022.2032606"", ""10.1111/j.1354-5078.1999.00281.x"", ""10.1515/9780228013044"", ""10.1111/nana.12707"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00493.x"", ""10.1080/1060586x.2018.1451232"", ""10.1111/nana.12782"", ""10.1111/j.1354-5078.1998.00187.x"", ""10.1111/nana.12032"", ""10.1111/j.1354-5078.1995.00297.x"", ""10.1080/1060586x.2018.1452247"", ""10.1080/0966813032000161437"", ""10.1111/j.1354-5078.1998.00301.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

But there may be also good reasons to distinguish between them. This article considers in detail one important attempt in that direction by the classicist Moses Finley. It argues that there is considerable strength in that approach, putting the stress as it does on the distinctiveness of the settler community. It is also valuable in suggesting that early-modern Western colonialism marked a new departure in an older history of imperialism, thus once again suggesting the need for a conceptual separation of the two. But the article concludes that ultimately more may be lost than gained by insisting on the distinction. In particular, it inhibits wide-ranging comparisons between ancient and modern, and Western and non-Western, empires, which can often suggest illuminating connections and parallels. The field of empire studies gains by drawing on the rich store of examples provided by the whole history of empire, from the earliest times to now. Western colonialism is part of that story; to separate it out is to impoverish the field.","[{""name"": ""Krishan Kumar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1525/9780520938618"", ""10.1080/14649373.2020.1720394"", ""10.1525/9780520918085"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199297276.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139047777"", ""10.1177/0725513617701919"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780199340491.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315544816"", ""10.1080/07075332.1998.9640824"", ""10.1515/9781400831661"", ""10.4159/9780674056206"", ""10.1086/201248"", ""10.2307/3679077"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2010.00448.x"", ""10.2307/2170830"", ""10.1177/002200946900400101"", ""10.1515/9781400827978"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77c6d"", ""10.4159/9780674042025"", ""10.1007/s11186-009-9102-8"", ""10.1017/S0165115300007567"", ""10.1080/07075332.1998.9640829"", ""10.1080/10275720032000069601"", ""10.1215/00161071-25-2-295"", ""10.1080/03086539808583023"", ""10.1057/9780230299191"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780192802231.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674915909"", ""10.1080/14623520601056240"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199249077.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2505147"", ""10.1080/13642529.2018.1451077""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

However, with great power comes great complexity. Reasoning about distributed systems is well-known to be difficult. In this paper we present , a novel framework based on separation logic supporting modular, node-local reasoning about concurrent and distributed systems. The logic is higher-order, concurrent, with higher-order store and network sockets, and is fully mechanized in the Coq proof assistant. We use our framework to verify an implementation of a load balancer that uses multi-threading to distribute load amongst multiple servers and an implementation of the two-phase-commit protocol with a replicated logging service as a client. The two examples certify that is well-suited for both horizontal and vertical modular reasoning.","[{""name"": ""Morten Krogh-Jespersen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amin Timany"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marit Edna Ohlenbusch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simon Oddershede Gregersen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lars Birkedal"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/1926385.1926435"", ""10.1145/2429069.2429104"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14107-2_24"", ""10.1090/psapm/019/0235771"", ""10.1007/3-540-08755-9_9"", ""10.1145/2815400.2815428"", ""10.1145/3371074"", ""10.1109/32.588521"", ""10.1007/BFb0053567"", ""10.1145/1328438.1328472"", ""10.1145/3158154"", ""10.1145/2951913.2951943"", ""10.1017/S0956796818000151"", ""10.1145/2676726.2676980"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2017.17"", ""10.1145/1250734.1250755"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54434-1_26"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009855"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-44914-8_13"", ""10.1109/TSE.1977.229904"", ""10.1016/0376-5075(78)90045-4"", ""10.1007/3-540-57318-6_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-17511-4_20"", ""10.1145/2837614.2837622"", ""10.1145/2429069.2429134"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_16"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2006.12.035"", ""10.1109/SFCS.1977.32"", ""10.14279/tuj.eceasst.72.1013"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2017.05.009"", ""10.1109/LICS.2002.1029817"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-44202-9_9"", ""10.1145/2737924.2737964"", ""10.1145/3158116"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_9"", ""10.1145/3158152"", ""10.1145/2003476.2003499"", ""10.1145/2500365.2500600"", ""10.1145/2737924.2737958""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Despite blatant electoral fraud and procedural violations, the official results declared Aleksandr Lukashenka reelected for a sixth term. While in the past, even the most obviously fraudulent election results have been followed by an atmosphere of resigned acceptance, this time countless Belarusians took to the streets to contest the results. What made this election different? This analysis of current affairs looks at the 2020 events through the lens of authoritarian consolidation theory, suggesting the unprecedented political mobilization was enabled by erosion in the three pillars of authoritarian stability: repression, cooptation, and legitimation. A majority of the population had been accepting the political status quo out of fear, for social and monetary security provided in exchange for loyalty, or a general understanding that there were no alternatives. Lukashenka did not realize this had largely changed. Nine months later, the foundation of the authoritarian regime is in an even worse shape. The regime’s reliance on repression further counteracts the legitimacy of the system. As a result, it seems it will be difficult for the authorities to re-consolidate authoritarianism, at least in the near future, no matter how the ‘revolution’ unfolds.","[{""name"": ""Sofie Bedford"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2139/ssrn.2571905"", ""10.1177/0888325415599826"", ""10.1080/17513057.2019.1677934"", ""10.1007/s10272-020-0913-1"", ""10.30965/20526512-00801005"", ""10.1080/13510347.2013.738860"", ""10.1080/09668136.2018.1555796"", ""10.1177/2336825X20984340"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66523-8_3"", ""10.4324/9780203737910"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804939.012"", ""10.1016/j.euras.2009.11.004"", ""10.15388/Polit.2012.4.1142"", ""10.1080/13510347.2013.738862"", ""10.1080/0966813032000130675"", ""10.7829/9789639776685Bekus"", ""10.23865/noros.v35.2653""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article studies Karl Haushofer's theory of the “Indo-Pacific” as an organic and integral space primed for political consciousness. Haushofer not only laid the oceanographic foundation of the “Indo-Pacific” with novel evidence in marine sciences, ethnography, and philology, but also legitimated it as a social and political space. Mindful of Germany's geopolitical predicament in the interwar period and informed by sources in indology and sinology, Haushofer envisaged the political resurrection of South, East, and Southeast Asia against colonial domination, and conceived the “Indo-Pacific” vision for remaking the international order.","[{""name"": ""Hansong Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/intejethi.28.4.2377465"", ""10.1080/00045608.2011.653732"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511988905"", ""10.1515/9783050073019"", ""10.2307/1949220"", ""10.1080/14650049808407631"", ""10.1016/S0962-6298(96)00009-1"", ""10.1080/23801883.2016.1228175"", ""10.1080/09700160701355485"", ""10.1016/0260-9827(87)90002-4"", ""10.53910/26531313-E200370418/419309"", ""10.1016/0260-9827(87)90003-6"", ""10.3138/9781442686854-004"", ""10.1111/1468-229X.12326"", ""10.1111/hisn.12025"", ""10.1515/9783050069678""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Transportation', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

The evidence points to a significant deterioration in their livelihoods and social inclusion, and potential profound changes in (im)mobility regimes caused by pandemic‐induced restrictive measures.","[{""name"": ""Gisela P.

Conventional or learning-based 3D reconstruction methods from images have clearly shown their potential for 3D heritage documentation. Nevertheless, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) approaches are recently revolutionising the way a scene can be rendered or reconstructed in 3D from a set of oriented images. Therefore the paper wants to review some of the last NeRF methods applied to various cultural heritage datasets collected with smartphone videos, touristic approaches or reflex cameras. Firstly several NeRF methods are evaluated. It turned out that Instant-NGP and Nerfacto methods achieved the best outcomes, outperforming all other methods significantly. Successively qualitative and quantitative analyses are performed on various datasets, revealing the good performances of NeRF methods, in particular for areas with uniform texture or shining surfaces, as well as for small datasets of lost artefacts. This is for sure opening new frontiers for 3D documentation, visualization and communication purposes of digital heritage.","[{""name"": ""G. Mazzacca"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A.

The usefulness of such estimations hinges on the accuracy of the underlying simulation model. Data-Driven Simulation (DDS) methods leverage process mining techniques to learn process simulation models from event logs. Empirical studies have shown that, while DDS models adequately capture the observed sequences of activities and their frequencies, they fail to accurately capture the temporal dynamics of real-life processes. In contrast, generative Deep Learning (DL) models are better able to capture such temporal dynamics. The drawback of DL models is that users cannot alter them for what-if analysis due to their black-box nature. This paper presents a hybrid approach to learn process simulation models from event logs wherein a (stochastic) process model is extracted via DDS techniques, and then combined with a DL model to generate timestamped event sequences. An experimental evaluation shows that the resulting hybrid simulation models match the temporal accuracy of pure DL models, while partially retaining the what-if analysis capability of DDS approaches.","[{""name"": ""Manuel Camargo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marlon Dumas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oscar González-Rojas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-662-56509-4_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-45100-3_15"", ""10.1007/s12599-015-0410-4"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2020.113284"", ""10.1016/j.datak.2021.101897"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59536-8_30"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2017.04.003"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-26619-6_19"", ""10.7717/peerj-cs.577"", ""10.1016/j.is.2021.101724"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78238-4_8"", ""10.1016/j.is.2008.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2014.05.029"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53337-3_19"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.1137/1.9781611975673.14"", ""10.1007/s10270-020-00789-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58666-9_14"", ""10.1007/s10115-018-1214-x"", ""10.1016/j.is.2020.101561"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-32885-5_12"", ""10.1080/00031305.2017.1380080"", ""10.1109/TSC.2021.3139807"", ""10.1201/9781315162119"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2008.07.002"", ""10.1002/nav.3800020109""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"

The analysis is based on a new data set of prices from almost 600 markets. Unlike previous research, we find that convergence was a predominantly pre-modern phenomenon. It started in the late fifteenth century, advanced rapidly until the beginning of the seventeenth century when it temporarily stalled, resumed after the Thirty Years’ War, and accelerated after the Napoleonic Wars in response to trade liberalization. From the late 1840s, convergence petered out and turned into divergence after 1875 as policy decisions dominated technological change. Our results point to the ‘Little Divergence’ between North-Western Europe and the rest of the continent as starting about 1600. Long-term improvements in market efficiency began in the early sixteenth century, with advances over time being as uneven as in price convergence. We trace this to differential institutional change and the non-synchronous spread of modern media and systems of information transmission that affected the ability of merchants to react to news.","[{""name"": ""Giovanni Federico"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Max-Stephan Schulze"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oliver Volckart"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/ehr.12536"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511800610"", ""10.5479/sil.274320.39088000388900"", ""10.1093/ereh/her004"", ""10.2307/202442"", ""10.1515/9781400827817"", ""10.1515/9781400831883"", ""10.1162/003465302317411604"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00540.x"", ""10.2307/2598017"", ""10.1080/03585522.2018.1457979"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2013.10.003"", ""10.1017/S0022050700019537"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608133.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-00181-0_68"", ""10.1080/03585522.2014.949840"", ""10.3406/hism.1991.1386"", ""10.1017/9780511816215"", ""10.1093/ereh/hew013"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004178229.i-428"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2010.12.003"", ""10.1017/S0022050700006641"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496943"", ""10.1017/S1361491610000146"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139104234"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496820"", ""10.1017/S0022050711001914"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00608.x"", ""10.4324/9780203423387"", ""10.1257/0022051042177649"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2005.02.001"", ""10.1257/jep.29.4.227"", ""10.1016/S0014-2921(97)00129-3"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00415.x"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2004.10.001"", ""10.1017/S0022050702001055"", ""10.1002/jae.659"", ""10.1257/000282803769206278"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107707603"", ""10.1162/003355397555398"", ""10.1006/exeh.2001.0775"", ""10.4324/9780203183281"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2009.04.005"", ""10.1111/1468-0262.00199"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2012.09.002"", ""10.4324/9780203596890""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Demography']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)]]"
10.1108/HESWBL-08-2019-0103,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,Developing curriculum for industry 4.0: digital workplaces,"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to introduce a framework used in a program for working executives, designed to prepare them for the digital workplace environment of industry 4.0.Design/methodology/approachThe paper adopts a case-based approach. It presents the current context about industry 4.0 and digitized workplaces. It then describes the case of designing the curriculum for a learning program on this theme, the responses received from participants and facilitators and conclusions that can be drawn from the responses.FindingsThe findings indicate that digital workplaces present challenges such as fragmentation of work, a resultant disconnect between team members, an uncertainty about assessment of efforts as well as assessment of output. Facilitation by coaches, extensive documentation, knowledge sharing, empathy and an alignment to shared goals mitigate these challenges to some extent. Facilitation also enables the participants to experience the true benefits of technology aided collaboration.Research limitations/implicationsThe participants in the program had an average work experience of two years, and a senior management view was not represented.Practical implicationsThe learning from the program would help in designing more such collaborative and immersive learning experiences.Social implicationsPrograms about virtualization and automation of work processes enable an appreciation of the inherent challenges and shortcomings and a fairer implementation of technologies at the workplace.Originality/valueThe program brought into the classroom an immersive experience of the evolving dynamics between employers, digital technologies and employees of contemporary workplaces.","[{""name"": ""Mita Brahma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shiv S.

Contourites include depositional features (separated, sheeted, plastered and confined drifts), erosional features (abraded surfaces, channels, furrows and moats) and mixed features (contourite terraces). Drifts generally show high- to moderate-amplitude reflectors, which are cyclically intercalated with transparent layers. Transparent layers may represent finer-grained deposits, which can serve as seal rocks. High-amplitude reflectors (HARs) are likely to represent sandier layers, which could form hydrocarbon reservoirs. HARs occur on erosive features (moats and channels), and are clearly developed on contourite terraces and overflow features. Most of the contourite features described here are influenced by Mediterranean water masses throughout their Pliocene and Quaternary history. They specifically record Mediterranean Outflow Water, following its exit through the Gibraltar Strait. This work gives a detailed report on the variation of modern contourite deposits, which can help inform ancient contourite reservoir interpretation. Further research correlating 2D and 3D seismic anomalies with core and well-logging data is needed to develop better diagnostic criteria for contourites. This can help to clarify the role of contourites in petroleum systems.","[{""name"": ""Estefanía Llave"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), Rios Rosas 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""F.

A number of approaches have been proposed for how to reverse formal models of concurrent computation including process calculi such as CCS, languages like Erlang, prime event structures and occurrence nets. However it has not been settled what properties a reversible system should enjoy, nor how the various properties that have been suggested, such as the parabolic lemma and the causal-consistency property, are related. We contribute to a solution to these issues by using a generic labelled transition system equipped with a relation capturing whether transitions are independent to explore the implications between these properties. In particular, we show how they are derivable from a set of axioms. Our intention is that when establishing properties of some formalism it will be easier to verify the axioms rather than proving properties such as the parabolic lemma directly. We also introduce two new notions related to causal consistent reversibility, namely causal safety and causal liveness, and show that they are derivable from our axioms.","[{""name"": ""Ivan Lanese"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Iain Phillips"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Irek Ulidowski"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.scico.2017.10.008"", ""10.1147/rd.176.0525"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.223.7"", ""10.1145/347823.347828"", ""10.1109/LICS.2013.45"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-28644-8_19"", ""10.1007/11539452_31"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2006.07.036"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-21571-2_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54804-8_26"", ""10.1016/j.jlamp.2016.09.003"", ""10.1006/inco.1997.2634"", ""10.1007/s00354-018-0034-6"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2017.09.008"", ""10.1147/rd.53.0183"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45231-5_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-23217-6_20"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2016.02.019"", ""10.1016/j.jlamp.2018.06.004"", ""10.1109/IROS.2015.7353609"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-30793-5_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-22397-7_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-22397-7_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99498-7_5"", ""10.1007/11690634_17"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2007.08.018"", ""10.1016/j.jlap.2006.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.jlamp.2015.07.004"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36315-3_18"", ""10.1007/3-540-18088-5_19"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(96)80710-9"", ""10.1007/s00354-018-0040-8"", ""10.1145/1244381.1244404""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Computer Networks and Communications', 'Hardware and Architecture']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)]]"

It goes beyond the informal/formal binary, instead proposing the concepts of ‘para‐formality’ to describe economic activity that exists in parallel to regulated and taxed spheres, and ‘quasi‐formality’ to describe processes of formalisation that are supported by underlying informal practices. When unregulated, clasificadores enjoyed parallel services in health, finance and social security, implying that benefits of ‘formalisation’ must be explored ethnographically rather than assumed. The persistence of ‘quasi‐formal’ activity within formalised recycling plants complicates simple narratives of informal to formal transitions and suggests that the concept can be useful for the study of labour policies in Latin America and beyond.","[{""name"": ""PATRICK O'HARE"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Manchester  UK""]}]","[""10.1111/jlca.12220"", ""10.4337/9781849809290.00039"", ""10.2148/benv.37.1.30"", ""10.1017/S0022278X00008089"", ""10.1093/0199204764.003.0002"", ""10.1515/9780804793155"", ""10.1111/j.1470-9856.2011.00659.x"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1417.2012.01073.x"", ""10.1215/9780822372073"", ""10.1111/j.0309-1317.2004.00557.x"", ""10.1080/01436597.2013.800751"", ""10.1111/j.1470-9856.2008.00262.x"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(87)90038-6"", ""10.56021/9780801837357"", ""10.2307/2938384"", ""10.1177/0263775815600058"", ""10.1177/0734242X15600050"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2013.04.029"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8330.2010.00791.x"", ""10.7202/1014742ar""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S0960777320000089,CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN HISTORY,0603 World History,The Transnational Consensus: Fascism and Nazism in Current Research,"Transnational History emerged in the 1990s as a methodological perspective aiming to transcend the nation state as a prevalent unit of analysis. Akin to comparative history, transnational history focuses on transfers between countries and nations, cross-border exchanges and circulation of people and ideas, thus changing our understanding of modern historical phenomena and contributing to the development of global history. Today there is probably no modern historical subfield that has not heeded the new transnational insights. This review article argues that the history of fascism and national socialism have benefitted considerably from this epistemological advancement, and that this renewal has revolutionised our understanding of these ideologies, movements and regimes. Previously historians believed that fascism had emerged as a solution to the interwar crisis in different European nation states; ‘native’, ‘home-grown’ fascist movements, unique ultranationalist revolutionaries, spontaneously reacted to endogenous national problems and attempted a counterrevolution or national rebirth with different degrees of success. After the transnational turn, historians instead see fascism as a single transnational and global phenomenon that violently expanded throughout Europe and beyond by processes of transfer, mutual inspiration, hybridisation, interaction, entanglement and cross-border exchange.","[{""name"": ""Ángel Alcalde"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13507486.2018.1439885"", ""10.3917/hp.026.0191"", ""10.1017/9781108565714"", ""10.1080/21567689.2018.1449109"", ""10.1086/687475"", ""10.1163/22116257-00201002"", ""10.1057/9781137299833.0003"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198834595.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5cgbd6"", ""10.2307/j.ctvw04hnr.5"", ""10.1093/ahr/rhy571"", ""10.1017/9781108182423"", ""10.1163/22116257-00602001"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-35175-3""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, also known as the Jenkyns Event, was a hyperthermal episode that occurred during the early Toarcian ( c. 183 Ma; Early Jurassic) and resulted in numerous collateral effects including global warming, enhanced weathering, sea-level change, carbonate crisis, marine anoxia–dysoxia and biotic crisis. The IGCP-655 project of the IUGS–UNESCO has constituted an international network of researchers with different disciplinary skills who have collaborated and shared conceptual advances on uncovering drivers of the environmental changes and ecosystem responses. This volume, Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem Response to the Jenkyns Event in the Early Toarcian (Jurassic) , presents 16 works that investigate the early Toarcian environmental changes related to the global warming, sea-level rise, carbon cycle perturbation and second-order mass extinction through biostratigraphy, micropalaeontology, palaeontology, ichnology, palaeoecology, sedimentology, integrated stratigraphy, inorganic, organic and isotopic geochemistry, and cyclostratigraphy.","[{""name"": ""Matías Reolid"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Geología, Universidad Jaén, Campus Las Lagunillas sn, 23071 Jaén, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Emanuela Mattioli"", ""affiliation"": [""Université de Lyon, UCBL, ENSL, UJM, CNRS, LGL-TPE, F-69622, Villeurbanne, France"", ""Institut Universitaire de France, Paris, France""]}, {""name"": ""Luís V.

10.1093/ahr/rhz1226,AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,The Racialization of International Law after the Haitian Revolution: The Holy See and National Sovereignty,"Abstract The Haitian state shaped international definitions of sovereignty and national legitimacy after the Declaration of Independence in 1804. Haiti’s nineteenth century was not a period of isolation and decline; its first six decades were globally connected because the country’s leaders challenged their postcolonial inequality with diplomacy and state formation. This strategy aimed to establish Haiti’s membership in the “family of nations,” a central metaphor in European and American diplomatic, legal, and religious decision-making. In doing so, the Haitian state forced the Atlantic powers to redefine the boundaries of international relations. Haiti’s decades-long negotiations with the Catholic Church were tied to the racialization of the global hierarchy. After its Declaration of Independence, the Haitian state began clearing a theoretical path toward recognized sovereignty based on the dominant narrative that a society must be considered “civilized” on the world stage. But, as it cultivated internal policies and practices that rejected the dominant racist assumptions, these discriminatory ideologies became increasingly more explicit in international law.","[{""name"": ""Julia Gaffield"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Moreover, I find that companies postponed their initial public offerings and that foreign companies were more likely to delist after the onset of wars. Investors reacted negatively to the increase in war news coverage. There is evidence of mean-reversion after a threat of war and a negative drift following the start of war. Finally, I highlight the importance of proximity to military conflicts. In general, the evidence indicates that both managers and investors became more risk averse as a consequence of war news.","[{""name"": ""Gertjan Verdickt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/ehr.12429"", ""10.1007/s10679-006-9005-8"", ""10.1017/S0022050700108198"", ""10.1017/S002205071700002X"", ""10.1017/S1361491607001979"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00396.x"", ""10.1017/S002205070600012X"", ""10.1017/S0968565012000170"", ""10.1177/002234336500200104"", ""10.1017/S0022109009990469"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0335.2007.00607.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00545.x"", ""10.1007/s11698-018-0178-0"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2105786"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2005.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2011.11.004"", ""10.1111/ehr.12530"", ""10.1017/S1740022816000048"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhr026"", ""10.1017/S0022109017000862"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2017.11.005"", ""10.1257/aer.99.1.243"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhl021"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2011.02.007"", ""10.17016/IFDP.2018.1222"", ""10.1017/S0022050717000018"", ""10.1111/jofi.12018"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2017.08.013"", ""10.1016/S0304-405X(03)00125-9"", ""10.1017/S0022050700025171"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2004.06.003"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2005.00335.x"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2011.02.019"", ""10.1016/j.pacfin.2016.05.009"", ""10.1093/rof/rfs048"", ""10.1016/j.jempfin.2019.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2008.09.009"", ""10.1017/S1361491697000051"", ""10.1093/qje/qjs001""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Accounting', 'Finance', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Through a reflection on work in environmental history and associated disciplines, this paper presents a case for the strength and versatility of oral history as a key source for environmental history, while reflecting on questions of its reliability and scope. We identify three major insights provided by environmental oral history: into environmental knowledge, practices and power. We argue that, rather than being a weakness, the (inter)subjective and experiential dimensions of oral accounts provide a rich source for situating and interrogating environmental practices, meanings, and power relations. Oral history, moreover, provides a counterweight to a reliance on colonial archives and top-down environmental accounts, and can facilitate a renewal - and deepening - of the radical roots of environmental history. Furthermore, as a research practice, oral history is a promising means of expanding the participatory and grassroots engagement of environmental history. By decentring environmental expertise and eroding the boundaries (both fictive and real) of environmental knowledge production, oral environmental histories can provide key interventions in pursuit of a more just, sustainable world.","[{""name"": ""Brian Williams"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Geography Dartmouth College Hanover, NH 03755, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Mark Riley"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Geography and Planning University of Liverpool Liverpool L69 3GP, UK""]}]",[],['Health Professions'],['General Health Professions'],"[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1093/pastj/gtz020,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,SLAVE HOUNDS AND ABOLITION IN THE AMERICAS,"Abstract The lash and shackles remain two primary symbols of material degradation fixed in the historical memory of slavery in the Americas. Yet as recounted by states, abolitionists, travellers, and most importantly slaves themselves, perhaps the most terrifying and effective tool for disciplining black bodies and dominating their space was the dog. This article draws upon archival research and the published materials of former slaves, novelists, slave owners, abolitionists, Atlantic travelers, and police reports to link the systems of slave hunting in Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, and the US South throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Slave hounds were skillfully honed biopower predicated upon scenting, hearing, sighting, outrunning, outlasting, signaling, attacking, and sometimes terminating, black runaways. These animals permeated slave societies throughout the Americas and bolstered European ambitions for colonial expansion, indigenous extirpation, economic extraction, and social domination in slave societies. as dogs were bred to track and hunt enslaved runaways, slave communities utilized resources from the natural environment to obfuscate the animal's heightened senses, which produced successful escapes on multiple occasions. This insistence of slaves' humanity, and the intensity of dog attacks against black resistance in the Caribbean and US South, both served as proof of slavery's inhumanity to abolitionists. Examining racialized canine attacks also contextualizes representations of anti-blackness and interspecies ideas of race. An Atlantic network of breeding, training and sales facilitated the use of slave hounds in each major American slave society to subdue human property, actualize legal categories of subjugation, and build efficient economic and state regimes. This integral process is often overlooked in histories of slavery, the African Diaspora, and colonialism. By violently enforcing slavery’s regimes of racism and profit, exposing the humanity of the enslaved and depravity of enslavers, and enraging transnational abolitionists, hounds were central to the rise and fall of slavery in the Americas.","[{""name"": ""Tyler D Parry"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Nevada, Las Vegas""]}, {""name"": ""Charlton W Yingling"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Louisville""]}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Anthropology', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

It recounts the struggle between Republicans and Democrats for political allegiance among the army’s rank and file, in the process showing that the army’s captains, majors, and colonels spurred a pro-Republican political awakening among the enlisted men that burst onto the public stage through newspaper editorials, unit resolutions, and letters to home front politicians. The book traces the heated campaigning and voting activity on the front lines during critical elections such as the 1864 presidential contest, highlighting how an army that had once revered McClellan renounced him for consorting with the forces of peace activism and treason. Union soldiers asserted themselves as the guardians of civic virtue and used the power of political organization to set the terms in a heated debate over wartime loyalty.","[{""name"": ""Zachery A.

10.1017/jbr.2019.243,JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES,0603 World History,"Rehabilitating an Empire: Humanitarian Collusion with the Colonial State during the Kenyan Emergency, ca. 1954-1960","AbstractDuring the Kenyan Emergency of 1952–1960, one of the most violent episodes in the history of the British Empire, humanitarian organizations colluded with the colonial state to shore up British power. This article examines how aid agencies that claimed to exemplify the progressive internationalism of the postwar period participated in colonial violence. Far from condemning the brutality of the imprisonment and torture during the Kenyan Emergency, aid organizations were deeply implicated in parallel projects for women and children that sought to achieve the same objectives: the remaking of Kikuyu hearts and minds and the weakening of anticolonial resistance. Far from acting as a check on colonial violence in an era of burgeoning rights discourses in 1950s Kenya, self-proclaimed “impartial” internationalist organizations, while claiming to uphold values of universal humanity, worked as auxiliaries to the colonial counterinsurgency. Taking their cue from military counterinsurgency in 1950s Malaya, humanitarians sought to win “hearts and minds” and undertook material provision for imprisoned anticolonial activists and their families on behalf of the colonial state. They did so by importing new humanitarian expertise developed in wartime Europe and adapting it to fit within racist, colonial norms. In providing this allegedly impartial expertise, humanitarian organizations lent credence to the myth that rehabilitation in Kenya was a progressive program enacted by a liberal empire to modernize its subjects, rather than a ruthless attempt to stymie anticolonial resistance by any means necessary. In this case, postwar humanitarian internationalism did not challenge colonial brutality but enabled it.","[{""name"": ""Emily Baughan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S1816383115000636"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtq053"", ""10.2307/219387"", ""10.1525/9780520936645"", ""10.2307/j.ctv29g2hs5"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139547314"", ""10.1017/S0021853700031157"", ""10.1515/9781400831661"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511585517"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2281.2012.00608.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctv224tw99.13"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-19547-3"", ""10.1017/S0021853705001660"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199570485.001.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520928251"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtw042"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbx035"", ""10.1017/S0018246X01002163"", ""10.1080/14788810.2014.959836"", ""10.4159/9780674089150"", ""10.4159/9780674425507-006"", ""10.1177/0021909608089258"", ""10.2307/219979"", ""10.2307/523724"", ""10.3917/mond.142.0045"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtx059"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199674169.001.0001"", ""10.1086/495100"", ""10.1017/jbr.2016.57""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Anthropology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Despite advances in technology, their powerful nature often damages expensive instruments placed in their path. These challenges mean that turbidity currents have only been measured in a few locations worldwide, in relatively shallow water depths (&lt;&lt;2 km). Here, we share lessons from recent field deployments about how to design the platforms on which instruments are deployed. First, we show how monitoring platforms have been affected by turbidity currents including instability, displacement, tumbling and damage. Second, we relate these issues to specifics of the platform design, such as exposure of large surface area instruments within a flow and inadequate anchoring or seafloor support. Third, we provide recommended modifications to improve design by simplifying mooring configurations, minimizing surface area and enhancing seafloor stability. Finally, we highlight novel multi-point moorings that avoid interaction between the instruments and the flow, and flow-resilient seafloor platforms with innovative engineering design features, such as feet and ballast that can be ejected. Our experience will provide guidance for future deployments, so that more detailed insights can be provided into turbidity current behaviour, in a wider range of settings.","[{""name"": ""Michael Clare"", ""affiliation"": [""National Oceanography Centre, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, UK""]}, {""name"": ""D.

However, this literature has tended to focus on specific regions, and has often sidestepped the larger question of how to conceptualise the relationship between print media and colonial rule. While some have used the term ‘colonial public sphere’ or ‘colonial publics,’ others have preferred to avoid these terms and instead thought in terms of multiple and overlapping publics. What this literature has shown is that a single analytic model for analysing public spaces of discourse is not usable. In this Introduction to our Special Issue we propose a new framework for studying the publics created through print media in the colonial world. We outline a set of four factors – addressivity, performativity, materiality and periodicity – that can be applied to specific historical case studies. We then explain how the issue as a whole models this methodology as a means to analyse how print media (as one medium within the public sphere) functioned in specific colonial and semi-colonial spaces around the world.","[{""name"": ""Emma Hunter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leslie James"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/ahr/123.3.846"", ""10.1353/book5205"", ""10.1057/9780230623248"", ""10.1163/9789004229969"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199265121.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822389996"", ""10.1080/1013929X.2006.9678252"", ""10.1515/9780822375241"", ""10.1177/0263276407080093"", ""10.1086/244442"", ""10.1080/03071021003795055"", ""10.1177/0263276407080090"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199568963.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511619656"", ""10.1080/02560054.2011.621298"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316563007"", ""10.1093/ahr/118.2.401"", ""10.1017/S0010417518000191"", ""10.2307/465279"", ""10.1215/08992363-14-1-49"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674074743"", ""10.1057/9780230205147""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Anthropology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

This view relies on the “Pristine Myth” of an empty undeveloped land, but the abundant land of North America was already made productive and was the recognized territory of sovereign Indigenous Nations. We demonstrate that the development of strong property rights for European/American settlers was mirrored by the attenuation and increasing disregard of Indigenous property rights.

Originally, it was developed in the context of geosciences to increase the awareness of geoscientists to their cultural and social role, but over time expanded to define a way in which humans can rethink their relationship with the Earth system in the light of principles and values that can provide a healthy and safe life in respect for geo-ecosystems. The theoretical framework of geoethics has now consolidated, and it has become the proposal on which to base a global ethics for the new millennium. This chapter outlines the scientific and cultural reference framework in which geoethics developed; the theoretical foundations of geoethics and its main characteristics; global anthropogenic issues under a geoethical perspective; ethical and social aspects related to two potential human activities respectively to combat global warming (geoengineering); and to provide for the growing demand for georesources (deep-sea/ocean mining). The authors highlight the importance of sharing values and actions among planetary human communities to manage global changes and threats. One wonders if the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can suggest or confirm reflections on geoethical thinking. Finally, a charter for a responsible course of human development, articulated in nine principles and actions, is proposed.","[{""name"": ""Silvia Peppoloni"", ""affiliation"": [""Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Rome, Italy"", ""IAPG – International Association for Promoting Geoethics""]}, {""name"": ""Giuseppe Di Capua"", ""affiliation"": [""Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Rome, Italy"", ""IAPG – International Association for Promoting Geoethics""]}]","[""10.1130/SPE501"", ""10.1080/09644010701211650"", ""10.1002/9781119067825.ch11"", ""10.1144/SP508-2019-213"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-12010-8_1"", ""10.1126/sciadv.1400253"", ""10.1073/pnas.1704949114"", ""10.1029/2019EO121687"", ""10.1007/3-540-26590-2_3"", ""10.1007/s10584-006-9101-y"", ""10.2190/1GU8-EQN8-02J6-2RXK"", ""10.5751/ES-11236-240416"", ""10.4401/ag-7553"", ""10.1029/2009EO490006"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107<0960:GRGAAI>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-43766-8"", ""10.1007/s11948-005-0006-3"", ""10.5040/9781474236607"", ""10.2138/gselements.14.5.325"", ""10.1146/annurev.energy.25.1.245"", ""10.1007/s10584-006-9132-4"", ""10.2307/3857310"", ""10.1017/S0892679416000058"", ""10.1021/acs.est.9b02808"", ""10.1016/S0195-9255(98)00041-9"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2c3k261"", ""10.2138/gselements.14.5.301"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.017"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5930.1993.tb00078.x"", ""10.1144/SP508-2020-66"", ""10.1038/s43017-020-0024-3"", ""10.1002/9781119067825.ch13"", ""10.1353/book27397"", ""10.1080/13569775.2018.1452107"", ""10.1126/science.1103618"", ""10.1126/science.1172133"", ""10.1016/j.resourpol.2012.06.016"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-799935-7.00001-0"", ""10.1130/2016.2520(03)"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-12010-8_2"", ""10.5751/ES-10558-230446"", ""10.1002/wcc.198"", ""10.1093/biosci/biz088"", ""10.1038/461472a"", ""10.2138/gselements.14.5.291"", ""10.1146/annurev-earth-050212-123944"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-73250-3_6"", ""10.3390/su10113836"", ""10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[614:TAAHNO]2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1007/s13280-011-0185-x"", ""10.1177/2053019614564785"", ""10.1126/science.1259855"", ""10.2138/gselements.14.5.298"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-23571-9"", ""10.1130/GSAT01802A.1"", ""10.3390/min7110203""]","['Environmental Science', 'Physics and Astronomy', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Astronomy and Astrophysics', 'Geology']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7193), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7071)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)]]"

It finds while the concept of gastronationalismper sehas not been rigorously developed, scholarship of food and nationalism in general has been developing fast. A major development in the study of gastronationalism is the introduction of the everyday nationhood/banal nationalism perspective, which in turn diverts the focus away from the state’s intervention, a point emphasized by Michaela DeSoucey. The review of the field suggests that a renewed focus on the role of food in the interaction between state actors and international organizations would further refine the concept of gastronationalism. As for the study of food and nationalism, efforts to integrate findings from existing case studies to produce an overall understanding of society are needed.","[{""name"": ""Atsuko Ichijo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/08941920.2017.1422062"", ""10.1177/0003122410372226"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7_13"", ""10.1215/00182168-2009-091"", ""10.25222/larr.75"", ""10.1177/1468796808088925"", ""10.1525/9780520965522"", ""10.1080/00856401.2013.833071"", ""10.25024/kj.2010.50.1.11"", ""10.1017/S0026749X11000850"", ""10.1080/14631369.2014.939332"", ""10.1017/S0010417500015024"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7_15"", ""10.1111/sena.12219"", ""10.1080/00905992.2018.1473353"", ""10.1080/14747731.2016.1150570"", ""10.1111/j.1944-8287.2005.tb00264.x"", ""10.5840/cultura201512117"", ""10.1057/9781137483133"", ""10.5040/9781350074163"", ""10.1080/07409710.2011.599778"", ""10.1177/1367549418786404"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0467.2010.00354.x"", ""10.1017/S0026749X09990072"", ""10.1080/10350330903566004"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2013.08.001""]","['Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Food Science', 'Plant Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/S0963926819000221,URBAN HISTORY,0603 World History,De-industrialization: strengths and weaknesses as a key concept for understanding post-war British history,"AbstractThis article argues for a central role for the concept of de-industrialization in understanding the evolution of the economies of urban Britain in the years since 1945. Above all, it is suggested, this concept is crucial because it focuses attention on the consequences of the transition from an industrial to a service-dominated labour market. To make this argument requires a careful definition of the term, along with recognition of its potential weaknesses as well as strengths. Key issues are highlighted by drawing on three diverse urban areas, which help to show the ubiquity of the process, but also its diverse patterns, chronologies and impacts. These examples are a stereotypical ‘post-industrial city’ (Dundee); a major city where de-industrialization has played an under-regarded role in developments (London); and a medium-size town in the south of England (High Wycombe), where the decline of a core industry (furniture) was crucial to its recent history. The final sections analyse the relationship between de-industrialization and other key frameworks commonly deployed to shape understanding of the recent history of Britain: ‘decline’, ‘globalization’ and ‘the triumph of neo-liberalism’.","[{""name"": ""Jim Tomlinson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/hic3.12099"", ""10.1017/S0963926813000448"", ""10.1179/174581808X324289"", ""10.1111/1467-9485.00104"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwi053"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwp019"", ""10.1080/00420989550012708"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwv030"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2007.01.007"", ""10.2307/622738"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511521935"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511550027"", ""10.3366/scot.1995.0025"", ""10.1017/CHO9781139815024.013"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9485.1986.tb00272.x"", ""10.1017/S0963926816000730"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748686148.003.0003"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2011.06.004"", ""10.4159/9780674054264"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwt005"", ""10.1017/S0147547913000264"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-18501-6"", ""10.1080/13563460903553723"", ""10.1080/13545700701716680"", ""10.2307/621814"", ""10.1080/00420986520080021"", ""10.4324/9780203414941"", ""10.1177/002795010017200107"", ""10.1080/13619462.2012.673714"", ""10.1007/s10887-015-9122-3"", ""10.1017/S1361491602000187"", ""10.1162/rest.89.1.118"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198786092.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199589081.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-39255-7"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-5586-3"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190676681.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oxrep/15.4.35"", ""10.3366/scot.2016.0137"", ""10.1017/S0020859002000767""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

In this scheme, six first-order megasequence boundaries have been defined, characterized by extensive and long-lasting erosional hiatuses and major coastal regressions: (1) Caledonian (or Base Devonian) Unconformity; (2) Variscan–Saalian (or Base Permian) Unconformity; (3) Mid Cimmerian (or Intra-Aalenian) Unconformity; (4) Late Cimmerian (or Base Cretaceous) Unconformity; (5) Atlantean (or Near-Base Tertiary) Unconformity; and (6) Eridanos (or Mid-Miocene) Unconformity. These surfaces have been linked to regional causal factors ranging from orogenesis-related compressional uplifts, in either active plate margin settings (1) or foreland basin settings (2), to intra-plate dynamically supported uplifts associated with the development of mantle plumes (3, 5 and 6) and the end-of-rifting and associated widespread erosion of tilted fault block crests (4). The aforementioned megasequence boundaries punctuate the geodynamic evolution of the North Sea area and facilitate the subdivision of the entire the North Sea sedimentary basin fill into six megasequences, named here A–F. All of the lithostratigraphic units of the North Sea (formations and members) have been described within the context of this first-order tectono-stratigraphic framework. The correlation powers of certain stratigraphic markers are also compared and contrasted, together with the potential cross-border equivalence of sedimentary units on different sides of the political median lines.","[{""name"": ""Stefano Patruno"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Engineering, University of Nicosia, 46 Makedonitissas Avenue, CY-2417, PO Box 24005, CY-1700, Nicosia, Cyprus""]}, {""name"": ""Henk Kombrink"", ""affiliation"": [""North Sea Core, 8 Dubford Terrace, Aberdeen AB23 8GE, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Stuart G.

Saving energy is important for our living environment and to save cost in data centers. Yet, researchers compare the efficiency of algorithms still in terms of consumption of CPU time (or even wall time). Perhaps one reason for this is that measuring energy consumption of computational processes is not as convenient as measuring the consumed time and there is no sufficient tool support. To close this gap, we contribute CPU Energy Meter, a small tool that takes care of reading the energy values that Intel CPUs track inside the chip. In order to make energy measurements as easy as possible, we integrated CPU Energy Meter into BenchExec, a benchmarking tool that is already used by many researchers and competitions in the domain of formal methods. As evidence for usefulness, we explored the energy consumption of some state-of-the-art verifiers and report some interesting insights, for example, that energy consumption is not necessarily correlated with CPU time.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Philipp Wendler"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s00450-010-0119-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_55"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_9"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.5281/zenodo.3679337"", ""10.1145/2989081.2989088"", ""10.1109/CGC.2012.113"", ""10.1109/TPDS.2009.76"", ""10.1109/ISPASS.2013.6557170"", ""10.1109/IPDPSW.2015.70"", ""10.1145/2425248.2425252"", ""10.7287/peerj.preprints.1470v2"", ""10.1109/IGCC.2015.7393710"", ""10.1007/s00450-016-0325-4"", ""10.1007/s00450-016-0327-2"", ""10.1109/IPDPSW.2013.243"", ""10.1109/ICPPW.2012.39""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Hardware and Architecture']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)]]"

To do so, it employs the Foucauldian perspective on racism, understood as deployed in defence of one's own nation, which is imagined as ""race"". The article also contextualises this discourse by elaborating how three globally circulated racist themes (threat, unworthiness and otherness) are deployed to uphold three components of hegemonic Polish national self‐definition (vulnerability, deservingness and ‘Westernness’) against three aspects of the perceived liminality that destabilise this self‐definition (temporal, moral and spatial). The article concludes that in Poland, the ‘anti‐immigration’ discourse deploys racism as a device symbolically to ‘protect’ the imagined ethnically, religiously and culturally homogenous Polish nation from the belittlement and dilution of collective self‐definition under the conditions of globalisation.","[{""name"": ""Kinga Polynczuk‐Alenius"", ""affiliation"": [""Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies University of Helsinki Helsinki Finland""]}]","[""10.7765/9781526126610"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1392028"", ""10.1080/00313220903109235"", ""10.1080/01419870.1996.9993918"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2009.10.006"", ""10.1080/01419870802208388"", ""10.1080/14791420.2014.977309"", ""10.1080/01419870902999233"", ""10.56583/fs.171"", ""10.1080/1070289X.2014.950974"", ""10.2307/2501049"", ""10.1111/amet.12259"", ""10.1177/0959354301114006"", ""10.2307/2492615"", ""10.14321/j.ctvj7wpdx.9"", ""10.4135/9780857020239"", ""10.14324/111.0954-6839.059"", ""10.30674/scripta.70069"", ""10.1177/0038038518757952"", ""10.1080/15562948.2017.1317897"", ""10.1191/0309132504ph498oa"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-78990-3_5"", ""10.4324/9780203871898"", ""10.1111/j.1354-5078.1995.00163.x"", ""10.1007/s10767-018-9287-9"", ""10.1177/0888325413502222"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1djmgbf.20"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195131468.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315712741"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1451308"", ""10.1177/0888325416658950"", ""10.1177/0888325412448473"", ""10.1215/08992363-2010-018"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2011.00443.x"", ""10.1075/ct.7.15dij"", ""10.1177/0888325400014001002"", ""10.1215/9780822399018"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226993058.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/pastj/gtz069,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,A DIFFERENT STORY IN THE ANTHROPOCENE: BRAZIL'S POST-COLONIAL QUEST FOR OIL (1930-1975),"Abstract This article aims to identify new historical causes for the making of the Anthropocene (the rise of humans to a geological force) by addressing Brazil’s transformation into an oil producer and an oil-dependent country between 1930 and 1975. This example allows an escape from the essentialist explanation of the Anthropocene as the result of humans’ insatiable appetite for consumption, commonly rooted in an analysis of Western industrial society, and to focus instead on the notion of freedom in a former colony. Indeed, in the context of nation-building and modernization debates, petroleum appeared to many Brazilians as an opportunity to emancipate the country from its peripheral role as global raw material provider. The rise of petroleum gave a post-colonial sense to the nation-founding myth of Brazil’s exceptional nature, which served as romantic background for a movement towards resource sovereignty embedded into a global anti-imperialist context. In Brazil specifically, oil production became an opportunity for a process of ecological transformation that promised to rid the country of colonial landscapes of exploitation, and even appeared as a solution for stopping the unsustainable destruction of tropical forests. Ultimately, these petro-ideals of emancipation, by positively linking nature and the nation, also hindered fully detecting the scope of the pollution problems that oil was generating. As argued in the article’s conclusion, this example should rekindle the discussion about the unintended link between freedom and geological change in the analysis of Anthropocene causalities.","[{""name"": ""Antoine Acker"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Zurich""]}]",[],"['Environmental Science', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'General Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7446), ('0909 草学', 0.741)]]"

During this time interval, the margin evolved from an active margin ( c. 750–500 Ma: the Reguibat–Avalonian–Cadomian arc) to the final collision with Laurussia in Devonian times to form Pangaea. In this context, one of the oldest recognized ophiolites is the Bou Azzer Ophiolite from the Anti-Atlas Mountains, dated at c. 697 Ma and containing two types of mafic rocks, the youngest of which has a boninitic composition. To the north, in the SW Iberian Massif, the Calzadilla Ophiolite contains mafic rocks also of boninitic composition dated at c. 598 Ma. Farther north, in the NW Iberian Massif, the Vila de Cruces Ophiolite is formed by a thick sequence of mafic rocks with an arc tholeiitic composition and minor alternations of tonalitic orthogneisses dated at c. 497 Ma. In the same region, the Bazar Ophiolite has a similar age of c. 495 Ma. Also in NW Iberia, there is a group of ophiolites with varied lithologies and dominant mafic rocks with arc tholeiitic composition (Careón, Purrido and Moeche ophiolites) dated at c. 395 Ma. The composition of all these peri-Gondwanan ophiolites is of supra-subduction zone type, showing no evidence of preserved mid-ocean ridge basalt type oceanic lithosphere. Consequently, these ophiolites were generated in the peri-Gondwanan realm during the opening of forearc or back-arc basins. Forearc oceanic lithosphere was promptly obducted or accreted to the volcanic arc, but the oceanic or transitional lithosphere generated in back-arc settings was preserved until the assembly of Pangaea. Based on the ages of the described ophiolites, the peri-Gondwanan realm has been a domain where the generation of oceanic or transitional lithosphere seems to have occurred at intervals of c. 100 myr. These regularly spaced time intervals may indicate cyclic events of mantle upwelling in the peri-Gondwanan mid-ocean ridges, with associated higher subduction rates at the peri-Gondwanan trenches and concomitant higher rates of partial melting in the mantle wedges involved. The origin of the apparent cyclicity for mantle upwelling in the peri-Gondwanan ocean ridges is unclear, but it could have possibly been related to episodic deep mantle convection. Cycles of more active deep mantle convection can explain episodic mantle upwelling, the transition from low- to fast-spreading type mid-ocean ridges and, finally, the dynamic context for the episodic generation of new supra-subduction zone type oceanic peri-Gondwanan lithosphere.","[{""name"": ""Ricardo Arenas"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología and Instituto de Geociencias (UCM, CSIC), Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Sonia Sánchez Martínez"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología and Instituto de Geociencias (UCM, CSIC), Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Richard Albert"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut für Geowissenschaften, Goethe-University Frankfurt, 60438 Frankfurt, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Faouziya Haissen"", ""affiliation"": [""LGAGE, Département de Géologie, Université Hassan-II de Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco""]}, {""name"": ""Javier Fernández-Suárez"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología and Instituto de Geociencias (UCM, CSIC), Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Núria Pujol-Solà"", ""affiliation"": [""Departament de Mineralogia, Petrologia i Geologia Aplicada, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Pilar Andonaegui"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología and Instituto de Geociencias (UCM, CSIC), Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Rubén Díez Fernández"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Geodinámica, Estratigrafía y Paleontología, Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Joaquín A.

Presenting the case studies of Fannie Fern Andrews, Mary Parker Follett and Florence Wilson, it shows that, in emerging professional and disciplinary contexts that have hitherto lain beyond the purview of historians of international thought, these women developed their thinking about the international. The insights they derived from their practical work in schools, immigrant communities and libraries led them to emphasize the mechanics of participation in international affairs and caused them to think across the scales of the individual, the local group and relations between nations. By moving beyond the history of organizations and networks and instead looking for the professional settings and audiences which enabled women to theorize, this article shifts both established understandings of what counts as international thought and traditional conceptions of who counts as an international thinker.","[{""name"": ""Valeska Huber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tamson Pietsch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Katharina Rietzler"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/644347"", ""10.1080/17400201.2012.711755"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199577934.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1280162"", ""10.4324/9781315772394"", ""10.1080/14616742.2011.534660"", ""10.2307/369936"", ""10.1111/1467-856X.00053"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1j7x6pk"", ""10.1080/09612020802608140"", ""10.1057/9780230204300_11"", ""10.1086/603439"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199570485.003.0010"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300096217.001.0001"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691121840.001.0001"", ""10.1177/000271622109600120"", ""10.1515/9781400836635"", ""10.1111/1600-0498.12018"", ""10.4324/9781315259031"", ""10.2307/2143093"", ""10.1080/00309230.2010.530278"", ""10.1017/heq.2017.30"", ""10.1093/ahr/123.2.393"", ""10.1353/jowh.2003.0058"", ""10.1177/000271621606600104"", ""10.1111/0149-0508.00141"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316286838"", ""10.1080/00309230.2012.678869"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbn025"", ""10.1057/9780230370210_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-65575-8"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190495954.001.0001"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00091"", ""10.2307/j.ctt13x0h4w"", ""10.1353/jowh.2005.0025"", ""10.1179/1758348914Z.00000000068"", ""10.1057/9781137303523"", ""10.1353/jowh.2011.0013"", ""10.1111/j.1571-9979.1989.tb00519.x"", ""10.2307/1947133"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-77568-5"", ""10.5040/9780755625673"", ""10.1515/9781503623873"", ""10.1080/0046760X.2011.598469"", ""10.2307/3378349"", ""10.2307/2702343"", ""10.4159/9780674972711"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490439"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139012140"", ""10.1108/IJOTB-07-03-2004-B003"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195061215.001.0001"", ""10.1093/isq/sqy027"", ""10.1080/09612025.2013.820603"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511612183"", ""10.1525/9780520928251"", ""10.2307/2163478"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199704)48:4<289::AID-ASI2>3.0.CO;2-S"", ""10.1002/9780470998595.ch14"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139096829"", ""10.1017/S0020818300033464"", ""10.1017/S026021051700050X"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1j1w0c3"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16979-5_2"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000232"", ""10.1007/s11125-015-9348-z"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199845231.001.0001"", ""10.9783/9780812294774"", ""10.1086/213005"", ""10.4324/9781315772394""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article is the first to present a theoretical account of this variation applicable to modern typeset Standard Arabic. It is suggested that diacritics serve three basic functions: facilitation of reading comprehension; facilitation of prescriptively correct diction; and to evoke associations with other texts. Six modes of diacritization in modern typeset text are identified and related to data on rates of diacritization from a corpus of electronically published books. Further lines of research based on this framework are suggested.","[{""name"": ""Andreas Hallberg"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Languages & Literatures, University of Gothenburg Gothenburg Sweden""]}]","[""10.4324/9781315029535"", ""10.1080/19404158.2013.852980"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811975"", ""10.1023/A:1007906222227"", ""10.24297/jal.v5i2.2848"", ""10.1111/modl.12642"", ""10.1016/j.jksuci.2014.06.009"", ""10.1080/17586801.2017.1400493"", ""10.1080/00437956.1959.11659702"", ""10.1515/MULTI.2007.020"", ""10.4324/9781315512778"", ""10.1007/s11145-020-10040-6"", ""10.4324/9780203883280"", ""10.1007/s13369-020-05258-z"", ""10.4236/ce.2013.44036"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.108.1.204"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811975"", ""10.2307/602899"", ""10.1080/00437956.1959.11659702"", ""10.1177/0022219417718198"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-02139-8"", ""10.1057/9780230107373"", ""10.1515/MULTI.2007.020"", ""10.1177/0022219417720460"", ""10.1007/s11145-020-10040-6"", ""10.1177/0022219417718198"", ""10.1515/9780748627240"", ""10.1016/0378-2166(83)90078-4"", ""10.4236/ce.2013.44036"", ""10.1016/j.jksuci.2014.06.009"", ""10.1163/15700585-12341405"", ""10.1080/17586801.2019.1697412"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.108.1.204"", ""10.1163/24519197-12340052"", ""10.1057/9780230107373"", ""10.1515/MULTI.2007.020"", ""10.1007/s11145-020-10040-6"", ""10.4324/9781315029535"", ""10.1016/0378-2166(83)90078-4"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511486975"", ""10.1177/0022219417720460"", ""10.1016/j.jksuci.2014.06.009"", ""10.1080/10888438.2016.1180526"", ""10.1163/24519197-12340052"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.134.4.584"", ""10.1177/0022219417718198"", ""10.1515/9780748627240"", ""10.1515/MULTI.2007.020"", ""10.1093/jss/41.1.99"", ""10.1080/17586801.2015.1114910"", ""10.1023/B:READ.0000013831.91795.ec"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.134.4.584"", ""10.1080/19436149.2012.658499"", ""10.1080/17586801.2015.1114910"", ""10.1080/17586801.2019.1697412""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Digital twins (DTs) are particularly expected to assist organisational processes, as behaviours of physical components are realistically represented by them using data for individual use cases. Nevertheless, DTs are extremely reliant on their use cases, leading to an extensive DT catalogue. However, a conclusive list of use cases for this accumulation of feasible DT application areas does not exist. To address this issue, this paper documents the use cases of Urban Digital Twin (UDT) platforms and applications with a state-of-the-art review. The study focuses on district-scale UDT applications that model, manage and analyse—buildings, transportation, energy, water, utility, and infrastructures that form smart cities. In order to catalogue diverse use cases found in several sectors, theoretical reasoning is developed. Our study provides a classified inventory that can be helpful for stakeholders in companies, government agencies and academia—such as researchers, architects, facilities managers, developers, and city planners.","[{""name"": ""P.

This paper documents that (1) available data do not support weather as the main explanation: 1931 and 1932 weather predicts harvest roughly equal to the 1924–1929 average; weather explains up to 8.1 percent of excess deaths. (2) Policies (collectivization of agriculture and the lack of favored industries) significantly increased famine mortality; collectivization explains up to 52 percent of excess deaths.

10.1017/ssh.2019.46,SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY,0603 World History,The Great Migration and Residential Segregation in American Cities during the Twentieth Century,"ABSTRACTThe Great Migration from the South and the rise of racial residential segregation strongly shaped the twentieth-century experience of African Americans. Yet, little attention has been devoted to how the two phenomena were linked, especially with respect to the individual experiences of the migrants. We address this gap by using novel data that links individual records from the complete-count 1940 Census to those in the 2000 Census long form, in conjunction with information about the level of racial residential segregation in metropolitan areas in 1940 and 2000. We first consider whether migrants from the South and their children experienced higher or lower levels of segregation in 1940 relative to their counterparts who were born in the North or who remained in the South. Next, we extend our analysis to second-generation Great Migration migrants and their segregation outcomes by observing their location in 2000. Additionally, we assess whether second-generation migrants experience larger decreases in their exposure to segregation as their socioeconomic status increases relative to their southern and/or northern stayer counterparts. Our study significantly advances our understanding of the Great Migration and the “segregated century.”","[{""name"": ""Christine Leibbrand"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Catherine Massey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J.

The lateral and vertical distribution of calibrated seismic facies within this framework highlights the evolution through time of the carbonate system and bathymetry of the host lacustrine basin. Despite the simple, largely abiotic and microbial components, lacustrine carbonate accumulations formed complex geometries that closely resemble those observed from marine systems, suggesting that a downward-tapering carbonate production profile must have occurred. The complexity of the stratigraphic architecture reflects lateral variations in subsidence patterns combined with the interference of the basement topography, palaeowind directions and basinal filling patterns. Well-imaged clinoforms several hundred metres high attest to both the existence of significant lake-bottom topography, locally in excess of 800 m, and the occurrence of deep water at time of deposition. Platform margin trajectory and vertical and lateral architecture of clinoform packages through time reveal distinct sequence boundaries that can be correlated in detail only locally, demonstrating the impact of syndepositional tectonics, and possibly recurrent isolation of smaller lakes during lowstands. Depositional models from this study fill a gap in current understanding of lacustrine carbonate systems and offer a template for exploration and appraisal of the presalt play.","[{""name"": ""M.

Fogo Island in the southern Cape Verdes is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, making it both prone to collapse (as evidenced by the c. 73 ka Monte Amarelo volcanic flank collapse), and a source of widely distributed tephra and volcanic material. The offshore distribution of the Monte Amarelo debris avalanche deposits and the surrounding volcaniclastic apron were previously mapped using only medium-resolution bathymetric data. Here, using recently acquired, higher-resolution acoustic data, we revisit Fogo's flank collapse and find evidence suggesting that the deposition of hummocky volcanic debris originating from the failed eastern flank most likely triggered the contemporaneous, multi-phase failure of pre-existing seafloor sediments. Additionally, we identify, for the first time, multiple mass-transport deposits in the southern part of the volcaniclastic apron of Fogo and Santiago based on the presence of acoustically chaotic deposits in parametric echo sounder data and volcaniclastic turbiditic sands in recovered cores. These preliminary findings indicate a long and complex history of instability on the southern slopes of Fogo and suggest that Fogo may have experienced multiple flank collapses.","[{""name"": ""Rachel Barrett"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Geosciences, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24118 Kiel, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Elodie Lebas"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Geosciences, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24118 Kiel, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Ricardo Ramalho"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Dom Luiz, Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa, 1749-016 Lisbon, Portugal"", ""Departamento de Geologia, Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa, 1749-016 Lisbon, Portugal"", ""School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1RL, UK"", ""Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, New York, NY 10964, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Ingo Klaucke"", ""affiliation"": [""GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, 24148 Kiel, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Steffen Kutterolf"", ""affiliation"": [""GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, 24148 Kiel, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Andreas Klügel"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Geosciences, University of Bremen, 28359 Bremen, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Katja Lindhorst"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Geosciences, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24118 Kiel, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Felix Gross"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Geosciences, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24118 Kiel, Germany"", ""Center for Ocean and Society, Kiel Marine Science, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24118 Kiel, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Krastel"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Geosciences, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24118 Kiel, Germany""]}]","[""10.1029/2011JC007646"", ""10.1038/356701a0"", ""10.1007/s10346-019-01275-8"", ""10.1002/2015GC006034"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-57852-1_17"", ""10.1016/j.geomorph.2010.10.026"", ""10.1007/s00445-015-0905-3"", ""10.1038/4151014a"", ""10.3389/feart.2018.00223"", ""10.1111/j.1365-246X.1978.tb04282.x"", ""10.1016/S0377-0273(99)00103-1"", ""10.1016/j.margeo.2015.09.006"", ""10.5194/nhess-14-485-2014"", ""10.1016/j.quageo.2008.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.margeo.2014.03.013"", ""10.1002/2015GL066003"", ""10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04440.x"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(1997)123:3(102)"", ""10.1038/s41598-019-48327-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-00972-8_27"", ""10.1007/s11069-013-0681-3"", ""10.1029/2007JB005339"", ""10.1002/2015JB012061"", ""10.1029/2000JB900413"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2019.04.009"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-20979-1_27"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-00972-8_7"", ""10.1029/2010GC003451"", ""10.1002/2017JB014959"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-6512-5_35"", ""10.1002/2014GC005652"", ""10.1016/j.margeo.2016.07.001"", ""10.1007/s00367-013-0338-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-00972-8_1"", ""10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2010.07.010"", ""10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2019.106686"", ""10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2018.04.028"", ""10.1016/S0012-8252(01)00069-1"", ""10.1029/2008GC001983"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.1996.110.01.01"", ""10.1130/G20642.1"", ""10.1016/j.sedgeo.2019.01.002"", ""10.1126/science.226.4680.1312"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.1996.110.01.08"", ""10.1016/j.sedgeo.2011.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.margeo.2017.10.004"", ""10.1038/ngeo982"", ""10.1144/SP477.34"", ""10.1016/0377-0273(84)90002-7"", ""10.1007/s004450100129"", ""10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2008.06.014"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2014.09.014"", ""10.1029/2000JB900450"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2011.11.032"", ""10.1016/j.margeo.2012.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2019.04.024"", ""10.1007/s00531-015-1144-8""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],"['Atmospheric Science', 'Earth-Surface Processes', 'Geophysics']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0706 大气科学', 0.7502), ('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7343)], [('0709 地质学', 0.7376), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7361)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"

We re‐examine the age heaping–numeracy link in the light of evidence from nineteenth‐century Italian censuses, in which education explains little of the variation in age heaping. We argue that in general age heaping is most plausibly interpreted as an indicator of cultural, economic, and institutional modernization rather than a straightforward measure of individual cognitive skills. We do not rule out the use of age heaping as a numeracy indicator, but this needs to be done with research designs that are alert to historical specificities of the context under investigation.","[{""name"": ""Brian A'Hearn"", ""affiliation"": [""Pembroke College University of Oxford""]}, {""name"": ""Alexia Delfino"", ""affiliation"": [""IGIER and LEAP Bocconi University  Milan""]}, {""name"": ""Alessandro Nuvolari"", ""affiliation"": [""Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies  Pisa""]}]","[""10.1017/S0022050709001120"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00403"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2009.09.003"", ""10.1080/03585522.2015.1032339"", ""10.1111/ehr.12333"", ""10.1111/ehr.12615"", ""10.1111/pirs.12217"", ""10.1093/ereh/hey014"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2009.05.004"", ""10.1163/9789004236950"", ""10.1162/JINH_a_00049"", ""10.1515/9780773574618"", ""10.1017/9781108539913"", ""10.1017/S002205071100218X"", ""10.1093/ereh/heu018"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00582.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199936694.013.0010"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199944590.003.0007"", ""10.1080/03585522.2012.727763"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790881"", ""10.1007/BF00273112"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2012.12.002"", ""10.1017/S0010417500018727"", ""10.1086/688053"", ""10.1126/science.1238041"", ""10.1016/0014-4983(82)90008-0"", ""10.2307/1402833"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511523458"", ""10.3917/redp.301.0051"", ""10.1177/036319909001500123"", ""10.2307/1130503"", ""10.1086/217540"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.04.006"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000933"", ""10.1080/01615440.2017.1393359"", ""10.2307/3679153"", ""10.1093/past/38.1.56"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-40406-1_24"", ""10.1177/0265691414523549""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The technique has been employed on metamorphic samples exceeding temperatures of 270°C, but recently has been shown to be effective at lower temperatures. Thermal maturation techniques commonly depend on sample size, have varying efficacies at different temperatures and in different conditions. The underlying processes are not well understood, thus data interpretation can be ambiguous. Here we show the efficacy of Raman as a low-temperature thermal marker in a thrust belt. The Bornes region, in a French Subalpine chain, provides an opportunity to test the technique against published vitrinite reflectance data and thermal modelling for the first time. In doing so we show that Raman is an effective thermal marker to temperatures as low as 75°C, has a small error and is consistent with previous work. The Raman data allow us to postulate the relative thickness of the sedimentary succession across the chain, the timing of thermal maturation and the timing and thickness variations of the over-thrust Prealpine nappe. The work establishes Raman as a low-temperature thermal marker for correlation with other techniques to ensure effective and robust interpretation, that can readily be applied to fold–thrust belts in hydrocarbon provinces.","[{""name"": ""D.

They are associated in space and time with ultrapotassic shoshonites and high-K calc-alkaline rocks. This magmatism is linked with the geodynamic evolution of the westernmost sector of the Alpine–Himalayan collisional margin, which followed the closure of the Tethys Ocean. Subduction-related lamproites, lamprophyres, shoshonites and high-K calc-alkaline suites were emplaced in the Mediterranean region in the form of shallow level intrusions (e.g. plugs, dykes and laccoliths) and small volume lava flows, with very subordinate pyroclastic rocks, starting from the Oligocene, in the Western Alps (northern Italy), through the Late Miocene in Corsica (southern France) and in Murcia-Almeria (southeastern Spain), to the Plio-Pleistocene in Southern Tuscany and Northern Latium (central Italy), in the Balkan peninsula (Serbia and Macedonia) and in the Western Anatolia (Turkey). The ultrapotassic rocks are mostly lamprophyric, but olivine latitic lavas with a clear lamproitic affinity are also found, as well as dacitic to trachytic differentiated products. Lamproite-like rocks range from slightly silica under-saturated to silica over-saturated composition, have relatively low Al 2 O 3 , CaO and Na 2 O contents, resulting in plagioclase-free parageneses, and consist of abundant K-feldspar, phlogopite, diopsidic clinopyroxene and highly forsteritic olivine. Leucite is generally absent, and it is rarely found only in the groundmasses of Spanish lamproites. Mediterranean lamproites and associated rocks share an extreme enrichment in many incompatible trace elements and depletion in High Field Strength Elements and high, and positively correlated Th/La and Sm/La ratios. They have radiogenic Sr and unradiogenic Nd isotope compositions, high 207 Pb over 206 Pb and high time-integrated 232 Th/ 238 U. Their composition requires an originally depleted lithospheric mantle source metasomatized by at least two different agents: (1) a high Th/La and Sm/La (i.e. SALATHO) component deriving from lawsonite-bearing, ancient crustal domains likely hosted in mélanges formed during the diachronous collision of the northward drifting continental slivers from Gondwana; (2) a K-rich component derived from a recent subduction and recycling of siliciclastic sediments. These metasomatic melts produced a lithospheric mantle source characterized by network of felsic and phlogopite-rich veins, respectively. Geothermal readjustment during post-collisional events induced progressive melting of the different types of veins and the surrounding peridotite generating the entire compositional spectrum of the observed magmas. In this complex scenario, orogenic Mediterranean lamproites represent rocks that characterize areas that were affected by multiple Wilson cycles, as observed in the Alpine–Himalayan Realm.","[{""name"": ""Martina Casalini"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Via Giorgio La Pira, 4, I-50121, Firenze, Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Riccardo Avanzinelli"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Via Giorgio La Pira, 4, I-50121, Firenze, Italy"", ""CNR – Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse, sede secondaria di Firenze, Via Giorgio La Pira, 4, I-50121, Firenze, Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Simone Tommasini"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Via Giorgio La Pira, 4, I-50121, Firenze, Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Claudio Natali"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Via Giorgio La Pira, 4, I-50121, Firenze, Italy"", ""CNR – Istituto di Geologia Ambientale e Geoingegneria, sede primaria di Montelibretti, Area della Ricerca di Roma-1, via Salaria km 29.600, I-00015, Monterotondo (RM), Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Gianluca Bianchini"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Fisica e Scienze della Terra, Università degli Studi di Ferrara, Via Giuseppe Saragat, 1, I-44122, Ferrara, Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Dejan Prelević"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut für Geowissenschaften, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, J.-J.- Becher-Weg 21, D-55128, Mainz, Germany"", ""Department of Petrology and Geochemistry, University of Belgrade, RS-11000, Belgrade, Serbia""]}, {""name"": ""Massimo Mattei"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Scienze, Università degli Studi di Roma TRE, Largo S.

A new software tool (Rcrust) has been developed that allows the modelling of points in pressure–temperature–bulk composition space in which bulk compositional changes can be passed from point to point as the system evolves. This new methodology enables quantitative process-oriented investigation of the evolution of rocks. Procedures are outlined here for using this tool to model: (1) the control of the water content of a subsolidus system based on available pore space; (2) the triggering of melt loss events when a critical melt volume threshold is exceeded, while allowing a portion of melt retention; (3) the entrainment of crystals during segregation and ascent of granitic magmas from its source; (4) the modification of the composition of granite magmas owing to fractional crystallization; and (5) the progressive availability (through dissolution) of slow diffusing species and their control of the effective bulk composition of a system. These cases collectively illustrate thermodynamically constrained methods for modelling systems that involve mass transfer.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Jason Mayne"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Stellenbosch, Department of Earth Sciences, Private Bag X1, 7602 Matieland, South Africa"", ""Université de Lyon, Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans, UJM-UCA-CNRS-IRD, 42023 Saint-Etienne, France""]}, {""name"": ""Gary Stevens"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Stellenbosch, Department of Earth Sciences, Private Bag X1, 7602 Matieland, South Africa""]}, {""name"": ""Jean-François Moyen"", ""affiliation"": [""Université de Lyon, Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans, UJM-UCA-CNRS-IRD, 42023 Saint-Etienne, France""]}, {""name"": ""Tim Johnson"", ""affiliation"": [""Curtin University, Department of Applied Geology, WA 6845 Perth, Australia""]}]","[""10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019<0855:EFMMTA>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1093/petrology/egh019"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-0346-4_4"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2005.04.033"", ""10.1029/2009GC002540"", ""10.1016/0364-5916(87)90018-6"", ""10.2138/am.2010.3354"", ""10.1002/2014JB011088"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2016.09.028"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2016.09.027"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2017.12.026"", ""10.1007/BF00307281"", ""10.2138/am-1996-11-1215"", ""10.1007/s00410-003-0464-z"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1314.2010.00923.x"", ""10.1046/j.1440-0952.2001.00876.x"", ""10.1093/petrology/44.5.789"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2010.08.009"", ""10.2475/ajs.297.8.767"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1314.2011.00954.x"", ""10.1515/9783110561890-004"", ""10.1111/jmg.12429"", ""10.1111/jmg.12199"", ""10.1016/j.oregeorev.2015.11.012"", ""10.1126/science.225.4661.504"", ""10.1016/j.gsf.2017.12.009"", ""10.1111/jmg.12265"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1314.1988.tb00415.x"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1314.1998.00157.x"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1314.2004.00527.x"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1314.2005.00555.x"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2017.03.011"", ""10.1130/G22959A.1"", ""10.1007/s00410-006-0143-y"", ""10.1111/jmg.12087"", ""10.1046/j.1365-3121.2000.00299.x"", ""10.1130/G35718.1"", ""10.1111/jmg.12299"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1314.2002.00206_20_7.x"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1314.2010.00881.x"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1314.2000.00269.x"", ""10.1046/j.0263-4929.2001.00349.x"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1314.2003.00454.x"", ""10.1111/jmg.12071"", ""10.2138/am.2010.3371"", ""10.12789/geocanj.2017.44.114"", ""10.1144/jgs2013-039"", ""10.1111/jmg.12307"", ""10.2138/am.2005.1741""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Mechanics of Materials', 'Geophysics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Beyond drawing parallels between the cholera epidemics and the current crisis, the article argues for combining imperial and social histories in order to write richer and more grounded histories of internationalism. It explores this historiographical and methodological challenge by analysing the boardrooms of the international sanitary conferences, Middle Eastern quarantine stations catering for Mecca pilgrims, and ocean steamships aiming to move without delay during a worldwide health crisis.","[{""name"": ""Valeska Huber"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['History and Philosophy of Science'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

They have been underexploited in studies of younger lake sediments, either ignored or only qualitatively observed, because many NPP are destroyed by standard processing techniques for pollen and embryophyte spores. The palaeoenvironmental potential of palynomorphs, with representatives from all eukaryotic kingdoms as well as cyanobacteria and from all trophic levels in various lacustrine environments, has been recognized by a few Quaternary palynologists in the past few decades. NPP have proven particularly valuable in archaeological and environmental monitoring studies of human impact on freshwater ecosystems, with spores of some fungi and eggs/egg cases of some flatworms and roundworms associated with faeces of humans and livestock, and the acid-resistant remains of various life stages of cyanobacteria, algae and their aquatic consumers responding to increased turbidity and nutrient influx associated with permanent human settlements, particularly those associated with agricultural activity. Descriptions of NPP commonly encountered in Quaternary lake sediments and case studies illustrating applications to various research questions should encourage more palynologists that ‘“Quaternary non-pollen palynomorphs” deserve our attention!’, to quote Prof. Bas van Geel (2006, Review of Paleobotany and Palynology , 141 , vii–viii, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2006.04.001 ), undisputed Father of NPP research.","[{""name"": ""Francine M.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF or NeRFs) are to date emerging as a novel method for synthesizing novel views of complex 3D scenes, leveraging an artificial neural network to optimize a volumetric scene function using a set of input views. We conduct a preliminary critical review of the scientific and technical literature on NeRFs, and we highlight possible applications of the latter in the Cultural Heritage domain, for the image-based reconstruction of 3D models of real, multi-scale objects, even in combination with the more well-established photogrammetric techniques. A comparison is made between NeRFs and photogrammetry in terms of operating procedures and outputs (volumetric renderings vs. point clouds or meshes). It is demonstrated that NeRFs could be conveniently used for rendering objects (sculptures, archaeological remains, sites, paintings etc.) that are challenging for photogrammetry, typically: i) metallic, translucent, and/or transparent surfaces; ii) objects that present homogeneous textures; iii) occlusions, vegetation, and elements of very fine detail.","[{""name"": ""V.

10.1111/ehr.12997,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Living standards and the life cycle: reconstructing household income and consumption in the early twentieth-century Netherlands†,"AbstractConventional methods of measuring historical household living standards are often criticized because of the omission of women's and children's wages and non‐wage income; the focus on urban centres; and the exclusion of life‐cycle changes in household composition, income, and consumption. This article presents a method that accounts for these issues and applies it to agricultural and textile households in the early‐twentieth century Netherlands. It uses total household income, as opposed to the husband's wage, as the enumerator for calculating alternative welfare ratios. The results show that welfare ratios were not only structurally higher than those based on the male‐breadwinner model, but also followed a different life‐cycle trajectory. Furthermore, household portfolios were diversified and depended on local labour market structures. Thus, the study concludes that analyses based on men's wages only reflect the rough outlines of how households functioned.","[{""name"": ""Corinne Boter"", ""affiliation"": [""Utrecht University""]}]","[""10.1006/exeh.2001.0775"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00515.x"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2011.12.001"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2016.1163275"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00200"", ""10.1017/S0022050712000630"", ""10.1111/ehr.12377"", ""10.1017/S0268416000002101"", ""10.1016/S1081-602X(03)00006-X"", ""10.1093/hwj/23.1.59"", ""10.1093/hwj/35.1.78"", ""10.2307/2597872"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2007.12.001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2012.00663.x"", ""10.1080/13545701.2012.746465"", ""10.1017/S0022050715000662"", ""10.2307/2234892"", ""10.1017/S0022050700075495"", ""10.1080/13545701.2012.738302"", ""10.1111/ehr.12424"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2014.955515"", ""10.2307/2551457"", ""10.1111/ehr.12733"", ""10.1080/13545701.2012.734630"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2012.08.001"", ""10.1017/S136149169900009X"", ""10.1163/9789004299665"", ""10.1093/ereh/hev007""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1108/HESWBL-01-2022-0008,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,Learning from digital adaptations to the pandemic: enhancing work-based higher education,"Purpose This paper examines how the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated digital developments in apprenticeship and work-based learning in higher education (HE), focusing on practices that have ongoing value. Design/methodology/approach A literature review was carried out on the theme of HE work-based and work-integrated learning during the pandemic, followed by minimally-structured interviews with UK university staff responsible for apprenticeship and other work-based programmes. Findings The pandemic has accelerated adoption of online and digital methods to support work-based and apprenticeship learning. There has been progress from emergency measures to more pedagogically consistent ones. A blended approach is becoming common, with the learning and logistical benefits from digital methods ensuring their continuing use. Progress is uneven and there is still a need for improved digital pedagogy and better integration of theoretical and practical learning. Practical implications More attention is needed to digital pedagogy and to effective use of online methods to support work-based learning with corresponding implications for staff development. There are institutional implications in terms of ensuring that systems and structures support what is, particularly for work-based learners, likely to be a permanent move towards digital, blended and online learning. Originality/value There has been limited research on the impact of the pandemic on work-based learning, with most of the literature focusing on placements and projects. This paper presents findings at a point when universities are considering how technologically-supported methods will be employed on a more permanent basis.","[{""name"": ""Stan Lester"", ""affiliation"": [""Stan Lester Developments , Dulverton,""]}, {""name"": ""Mandy Crawford–Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""UVAC , Bolton,""]}]","[""10.1007/s10639-021-10507-1"", ""10.1080/13678868.2020.1778999"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-03-2020-0035"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-6977-0.ch003"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-11-2020-172"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-05-2019-123"", ""10.1080/03075079.2021.1894116"", ""10.3390/educsci10100291"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-04-2016-0023"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-06-2020-0134"", ""10.1108/JRIT-10-2020-0051"", ""10.1108/JWAM-01-2021-0010"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-05-2020-0104"", ""10.1080/03075070903216635"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-04-2020-0071"", ""10.1080/02615479.2020.1836145"", ""10.4018/978-1-7998-6440-0.ch008"", ""10.53761/1.18.5.2"", ""10.1080/10963758.2021.1907198"", ""10.5694/mja2.50765"", ""10.1108/EJTD-01-2021-0015"", ""10.1080/14739879.2020.1772123"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00621"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-02-2019-0022"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-05-2020-0105"", ""10.17645/si.v9i3.4125"", ""10.1108/JWAM-01-2021-0003""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

They originated from primary mantle-derived melts that intruded both cratons and off-craton regions, which were parts of former supercontinents – Columbia, Rodinia and Gondwana–Pangaea. Well known for hosting economic minerals and elements such as diamonds, base metals, platinum-group elements and Au, they are also significant for our understanding of deep-mantle processes, such as mantle metasomatism and mantle plume–lithosphere interactions, as well as large-scale geodynamic processes, including subduction-related tectonics and supercontinent amalgamation and break-up. This Special Publication presents an overview of the state of the art and recent advances as achieved by individual research groups from different parts of the world, and outlines future research directions. Mineralogical, geochemical, geochronological and isotope analyses are used to decipher the complex petrogenetic and metallogenetic evolution of these extraordinary rocks and unravel a complete history of tectonic events related to individual supercontinent cycles. The Special Publication including this introductory chapter also deals with some issues related to the classification of these rocks.","[{""name"": ""Lukáš Krmíček"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Geology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Rozvojová 269, CZ-165 02, Praha 6, Czech Republic"", ""Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Institute of Geotechnics, Veveří 95, CZ-602 00 Brno, Czech Republic""]}, {""name"": ""N.

It outlines how an increasingly mature literature emerged around the domestic political and foreign policy drivers of kin-state politics as scholars drew from a number of perspectives, from the literature on irredentism to that on diaspora politics and transborder nationalism. The article then evaluates scholarship on the drivers and impacts of kin-state politics, with a focus on the consequences of kin-state politics for the cultural and political landscape of external kin communities and the impact on regional security and stability. While a rich and nuanced literature has helped to contextualize the tensions and complexities of the former, I argue that the latter needs to be developed further. Careful work needs to be done to more precisely establish the conditions under which kin-state politics constitute a security threat. Future scholarship should bring together a more ground level perspective of how kin-state policies are perceived, utilized, and/or instrumentalized by their intended subjects with a critical understanding of how the “game” of kin-state politics is played within the home state and the kin-state.","[{""name"": ""Myra A.

Cooling of high-latitudinal areas may have been caused by orogenic processes at the northern margin of the Tethys Ocean that reduced heat transport towards the polar regions. Warm phases correlate to periods of intensified volcanism. The Jenkyns Event occurred during the transition from a late Pliensbachian icehouse into an early Toarcian greenhouse. Parallel evolution of different environmental processes, including sea level, climate and carbon cycle, indicate a causal mechanism tied to astronomical forcing. Insolation-controlled variations in the extent of the cryosphere (ice caps and permafrost) facilitated orbitally paced sea-level cycles via waxing and waning of the polar ice caps, and negative carbon isotope excursions via the release of cryosphere-bound 12 C-enriched carbon. This review and synthesis of sedimentological, geochemical and palaeontological palaeoenvironment indicators, and of simulations from climate models, aims to reconstruction, in particular, the high-latitudinal environmental conditions of late Pliensbachian–early Toarcian times. Focus is laid on the extent of the regions that were potentially suitable for hosting a cryosphere. An environmental response to cryosphere dynamics is considered to have been a key component of the Jenkyns Event.","[{""name"": ""Wolfgang Ruebsam"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Organic and

However, like their real-numbered counterpart, quantized networks are not immune to malicious misclassification caused by adversarial attacks. We investigate how quantization affects a network’s robustness to adversarial attacks, which is a formal verification question. We show that neither robustness nor non-robustness are monotonic with changing the number of bits for the representation and, also, neither are preserved by quantization from a real-numbered network. For this reason, we introduce a verification method for quantized neural networks which, using SMT solving over bit-vectors, accounts for their exact, bit-precise semantics. We built a tool and analyzed the effect of quantization on a classifier for the MNIST dataset. We demonstrate that, compared to our method, existing methods for the analysis of real-numbered networks often derive false conclusions about their quantizations, both when determining robustness and when detecting attacks, and that existing methods for quantized networks often miss attacks. Furthermore, we applied our method beyond robustness, showing how the number of bits in quantization enlarges the gender bias of a predictor for students’ grades.","[{""name"": ""Mirco Giacobbe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas A.

Since it requires a deep semantic and linguistic understanding of the question and the ability to associate it with various objects that are present in the image, it is an ambitious task and requires multi-modal reasoning from both computer vision and natural language processing. We propose Graphhopper, a novel method that approaches the task by integrating knowledge graph reasoning, computer vision, and natural language processing techniques. Concretely, our method is based on performing context-driven, sequential reasoning based on the scene entities and their semantic and spatial relationships. As a first step, we derive a scene graph that describes the objects in the image, as well as their attributes and their mutual relationships. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning agent is trained to autonomously navigate in a multi-hop manner over the extracted scene graph to generate reasoning paths, which are the basis for deriving answers. We conduct an experimental study on the challenging dataset GQA, based on both manually curated and automatically generated scene graphs. Our results show that we keep up with human performance on manually curated scene graphs. Moreover, we find that Graphhopper outperforms another state-of-the-art scene graph reasoning model on both manually curated and automatically generated scene graphs by a significant margin.","[{""name"": ""Rajat Koner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hang Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marcel Hildebrandt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Deepan Das"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Volker Tresp"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephan Günnemann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.01006"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00636"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.12"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.279"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00209"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2019.00471"", ""10.1609/aaai.v34i04.6600"", ""10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.93"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00686"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.215"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298990"", ""10.1007/s11263-016-0981-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2015.2483592"", ""10.3115/v1/D14-1162"", ""10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01008"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00857"", ""10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00377"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.344"", ""10.18653/v1/D17-1060"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.10"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.202"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.145""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1093/ahr/rhac156,AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,"Gender History, Global History, and Atlantic Slavery On Racial Capitalism and Social Reproduction","Abstract Bringing into connection the scholarship on social reproduction and racial capitalism shows that the global history of Atlantic slavery is a gendered story; and the gendered history of Atlantic slavery is a global story. Attending in particular to reproductive labor in all its forms, and to the centrality of gender relations to the transmission of property and status, enables greater understanding of Atlantic slavery as a critically important aspect of modern global history. Indeed, without attention to gender and specifically to reproductive work, the global history of Atlantic slavery will inevitably be partial and incomplete. The reproductive work of women in Africa, as well as in the Americas, should be understood as an integral part of the development of Atlantic slavery, and thus of racial capitalism.","[{""name"": ""Diana Paton"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Edinburgh , UK""]}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History and Philosophy of Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Zircon populations from 10 stratigraphic horizons in the Yellow Cat Member yield youngest single-grain ages ranging from 142.5 ± 2.7 to 133.7 ± 2.7 Ma (Berriasian–late Valanginian); those from one mudstone palaeosol yield a robust Concordia Age of 136.3 ± 1.3 (Valanginian). Additionally, a new palynoflora – one of a few to be published from the Cedar Mountain Formation – is assigned to the middle Berriasian to early Hauterivian stages, based on the presence of Foraminisporis wonthaggiensis and Trilobosporites sp. cf. T. canadensis , and the absence of F . asymmetricus , Appendicisporites spp. and angiosperms. Furthermore, these chronostratigraphic data allow us to interpret part of the so-called ‘Weissert Event’ C-isotope excursion (Valanginian) in a new C-isotope profile through a palaeosol-bearing alluvial succession in the Yellow Cat Member. This research extends a firm understanding of the formation further back into the Early Cretaceous than was the case previously (except for ostracod biostratigraphy) and sets the stage for future advancements.","[{""name"": ""R.

Crucial for this enterprise was interpreting the Soviet past. Although the latter was used for political purposes by both Boris Yeltsin (who attempted to break with it) and Vladimir Putin (who established continuity with it), a politically usable interpretation of the Russian Revolutions was never found. Such is the consensus that emerged in 2017. Challenging this consensus, I argue that a specific interpretation of the Revolutions—nested within a narrative that covers Russia’s history from Kievan Rus to the contemporary Russian Federation—has been developed in Russia. Turning Russia’s politically problematic past into a politically usable one, this interpretation is (re)produced through the project Russia—My History. As Russia—My History (initially developed within the Russian Orthodox Church) is becoming a part of state-sponsored efforts to forge an “official” vision of Russian history, the interpretation of the Revolutions (re)produced through it is growing in influence in present-day Russia.","[{""name"": ""Ekaterina V.

Contrary to the conventional narrative about a “sectarian journey” torn between a flawed primordialist and instrumentalist approach in between which a new superior “third way” is needed, the article shows that both primordialism and instrumentalism are rare in the academic debate on sectarianism, quite similar to the broader ethnicity/nationalism debate. However, this has not resulted in a “new conventional wisdom” about how to proceed. Thus, the article identifies a cacophony of suggestions for how the much aspired‐to third way should look like. Against this background, the article suggests that it is time to go beyond the ritual calls to “get beyond primordialism and instrumentalism.” Instead, it is time to devote more attention to examining the multiple already existing suggestions for “third ways”. Rather than highlighting a single third way as superior, the article contributes to this move in two ways: it shows how the various third ways can be grouped into three “beyond strategies” (the New Saviour, the Baby and the Bathwater, and the LEGO eclectic strategies) and outlines a number of meta‐theoretical issues to consider in order to move the debate forward.","[{""name"": ""Morten Valbjørn"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Aarhus University  Aarhus Denmark""]}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190233143.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01419870902763878"", ""10.1093/dh/dhv034"", ""10.1177/1065912917717641"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-115916"", ""10.1163/9789047404279"", ""10.1080/00396338.2014.882157"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199893157.001.0001"", ""10.1080/23269995.2016.1259231"", ""10.1017/S0020743808081476"", ""10.1111/johs.12189"", ""10.1111/nana.12579"", ""10.3751/68.1.12"", ""10.1080/13698249.2019.1595881"", ""10.1017/S1049096519000143"", ""10.3751/71.3.12"", ""10.1111/nana.12578"", ""10.1111/johs.12190"", ""10.1111/nana.12582"", ""10.1080/01436597.2017.1282818"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027363"", ""10.1515/9780691219752"", ""10.1017/S0003975600004239"", ""10.1515/9780804787222"", ""10.1080/13530198408705383"", ""10.1080/01436597.2015.1015788"", ""10.1080/09592318.2018.1455328"", ""10.1080/00396339308442672"", ""10.3751/69.4.13"", ""10.2307/j.ctt183p3d5"", ""10.1080/13510347.2015.1010813"", ""10.2307/587365"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-01359-0"", ""10.4324/9780203876558"", ""10.1111/sena.12289"", ""10.1111/sena.12293"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511660054.009"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjf9zdr"", ""10.2307/1389517""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Almost sure termination (AST) is concerned with the question whether a program terminates with probability one on all possible inputs. Positive almost sure termination (PAST) focuses on termination in a finite expected number of steps. This paper presents a fully automated approach to the termination analysis of probabilistic while-programs whose guards and expressions are polynomial expressions. As proving (positive) AST is undecidable in general, existing proof rules typically provide sufficient conditions. These conditions mostly involve constraints on supermartingales. We consider four proof rules from the literature and extend these with generalizations of existing proof rules for (P)AST. We automate the resulting set of proof rules by effectively computing asymptotic bounds on polynomials over the program variables. These bounds are used to decide the sufficient conditions – including the constraints on supermartingales – of a proof rule. Our software tool Amber can thus check AST, PAST, as well as their negations for a large class of polynomial probabilistic programs, while carrying out the termination reasoning fully with polynomial witnesses. Experimental results show the merits of our generalized proof rules and demonstrate that Amber can handle probabilistic programs that are out of reach for other state-of-the-art tools.","[{""name"": ""Marcel Moosbrugger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ezio Bartocci"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joost-Pieter Katoen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Kovács"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3158122"", ""10.1785/0120120107"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2019.102338"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31784-3_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-64276-1_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5"", ""10.1080/08929882.2015.1039431"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-32033-3_24"", ""10.1007/b105073"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_1"", ""10.1145/3174800"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009873"", ""10.1145/3385412.3386002"", ""10.1007/11817963_37"", ""10.1145/1941487.1941509"", ""10.1145/3293605"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31424-7_14"", ""10.1145/2676726.2677001"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314633"", ""10.1007/s10817-016-9388-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-29436-6_16"", ""10.3929/ETHZ-A-001631582"", ""10.29007/nxv1"", ""10.1145/3371105"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_30"", ""10.1145/363235.363259"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02768-1_11"", ""10.1145/3360555"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-48057-1_24"", ""10.1145/3208102"", ""10.1007/978-3-7091-0445-3"", ""10.1007/978-1-4684-9455-6"", ""10.1016/0022-0000(81)90036-2"", ""10.1016/0022-0000(85)90012-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54577-5_29"", ""10.1145/1059816.1059824"", ""10.1145/3158121"", ""10.1007/3-540-47764-0"", ""10.26226/morressier.604907f41a80aac83ca25d19"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3"", ""10.1145/3192366.3192394"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08918-8_32""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

They are generated by partial melting of diverse crustal and mantle sources and subsequent differentiation of the primary magmas, and are formed through a variety of geodynamic processes. Granitoids, therefore, are important archives for early Earth lithospheric evolution. Peninsular India comprises five cratonic blocks bordered by mobile belts. The cratons that stabilized during the Paleoarchean–Mesoarchean (Singhbhum and Western Dharwar) recorded mostly diapirism or sagduction tectonics. Conversely, cratons that stabilized during the late Neoarchean (Eastern Dharwar, Bundelkhand, Bastar and Aravalli) show evidence consistent with terrane accretion–collision in a convergent setting. Thus, the Indian cratons provide testimony to a transition from a dominantly pre-plate tectonic regime in the Paleoarchean–Mesoarchean to a plate-tectonic-like regime in the late Neoarchean. Despite this diversity, all five cratons had a similar petrological evolution with a long period (250–850 myr) of episodic tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG) magmatism followed by a shorter period (30–100 myr) of granitoid diversification (sanukitoid, K-rich anatectic granite and A-type granite) with signatures of input from both mantle and crust. The contributions of this Special Publication cover diverse granitoid-related themes, highlighting the potential of Indian cratons in addressing global issues of Archean crustal evolution.","[{""name"": ""Sukanta Dey"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Earth Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Mohanpur, Nadia 741 246, West Bengal, India""]}, {""name"": ""Jean-François Moyen"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans, UJM-UCA-CNRS-IRD, Université de Lyon, 23 rue Dr Paul Michelon, 42023 Saint Etienne, France""]}]","[""10.1144/SP489-2018-195"", ""10.18814/epiiugs/2020/020003"", ""10.1144/SP489-2019-315"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(95)00144-2"", ""10.1098/rsta.2017.0405"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(99)00055-8"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(97)00007-7"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-63901-1.00021-6"", ""10.1029/2010GC003398"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103085"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-25494-6"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2012.05.005"", ""10.1144/SP449.9"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2017.06.009"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-63901-1.00030-7"", ""10.1144/SP489-2019-202"", ""10.18814/epiiugs/2020/020005"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2007.08.005"", ""10.1016/S1367-9120(03)00136-6"", ""10.2465/jmps.190824a"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2017.09.016"", ""10.1144/SP449.10"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2016.01.016"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-42845-7"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2019.09.005"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-15989-4_2"", ""10.1144/SP489-2018-125"", ""10.1144/SP449.8"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2014.09.019"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2016.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2019.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2014.10.010"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2016.01.009"", ""10.1144/SP489-2019-292"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2015.12.008"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2017.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2004.04.048"", ""10.1086/698844"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2019.105436"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2013.12.017"", ""10.1144/SP489-2019-108"", ""10.1144/SP489-2019-311"", ""10.1144/SP489-2018-34"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(03)00183-9"", ""10.18814/epiiugs/2020/020002"", ""10.1016/j.oregeorev.2015.05.020"", ""10.1016/S1342-937X(05)70757-7"", ""10.1098/rsta.2018.0103"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2014.09.024"", ""10.1144/SP489-2018-88"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.02.040"", ""10.1144/SP489-2019-342"", ""10.1007/s00126-004-0441-0"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2012.06.009"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2013.03.009"", ""10.1144/0016-76492008-089"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2020.105630"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116206"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89698-4_22"", ""10.1029/2018GL078114"", ""10.1017/S0016756815000692"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2019.09.012"", ""10.1016/0301-9268(93)90097-L"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139196123"", ""10.1007/s12594-016-0519-1"", ""10.1144/SP489-2018-72"", ""10.1144/SP489-2019-287"", ""10.1016/j.gsf.2019.02.001"", ""10.1086/629023"", ""10.1016/j.jseaes.2015.05.023"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(02)00212-7""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],['Geophysics'],"[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"
10.1093/pastj/gtab022,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,"Aliens in a Revolutionary World: Refugees, Migration Control and Subjecthood in the British Atlantic, 1790s-1820s*","Abstract During the political and military upheavals between the 1770s and 1820s, societies and states across the Atlantic world grappled with intricate issues of political belonging and sovereignty. Along with the rise of new concepts of national citizenship, older concepts of monarchical or imperial subjecthood underwent fundamental changes. While scholars tend to ascribe these transformations to revolutionary innovation, the movement of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing revolutions and violent conflict was no less important in reshaping the terms of political membership. In response to these migrations, national and colonial governments passed legislation meant to control the mobility of foreign refugees. Based on the case of three men of colour, the sons of Haitian refugees, deported from Jamaica in 1823, this article explores the wider impact the regulation of alien status had. The 1823 incident set off a major legal battle and a sprawling debate about the terms of membership in the transforming British Empire. The affair raised fundamental questions about the status and rights of foreigners, the definition of who was a subject of the British Crown, and about how sovereignty was to be conceived in a period of continuous territorial transfers and military occupations.","[{""name"": ""Jan C Jansen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"
10.1215/01636545-8359271,RADICAL HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History,"""No State Apparatus Goes to Bed Genocidal Then Wakes Up Democratic"" Fascist Ideology and Transgender Politics in Post-dictatorship Argentina","Abstract This article forms part of an emerging body of scholarship on the sex/gender politics of authoritarian regimes in Latin America, turning specific attention to Argentine trans and travesti politics and rights claims as these articulate with legacies of authoritarianism. On March 24, 1976, the Argentine military staged a coup d’état and established a dictatorship, perpetrating mass civilian murder until democratic transition in 1983. Drawing on state intelligence archive surveillance documents, the artist-activist intervention Campaña DESAPARECER, and travesti and transgender testimony, this article argues that the enduring social and political legacies of interwar fascism not only persisted into the years of dictatorship, but that they also continue to animate and mediate post-dictatorship transgender politics. That is, in democracy, the enduring afterlife of fascism creates conditions of possibility for activists to mobilize the language of anti-fascism and shared memories of fascist state violence in the service of contemporary transgender rights claims. Such rights claims reveal illiberal state violence’s deadly imbrications with the politics of sex and gender during dictatorship and, at the same time, challenge present-day liberal narratives that relegate state violence to a distant illiberal past.","[{""name"": ""Cole Rizki"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0891243207306383"", ""10.1215/23289252-7090087"", ""10.1215/10642684-7551140"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469627502.001.0001"", ""10.1215/23289252-7348510"", ""10.1080/0966369X.2015.1058756"", ""10.1353/aq.2014.0055"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199930241.001.0001"", ""10.1215/23289252-7348482"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469611617.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0022216X14000686"", ""10.1215/23289252-7348426"", ""10.1177/1470412920941905"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11smz1k.10""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Here we share our analysis of a survey of 314 PDWs, conducted between April and May 2020, confirming that PDWs in Peru are highly unprotected, particularly during the COVID pandemic, in which there has been a lack of comprehensive social protection schemes.","[{""name"": ""Leda M.

Drawing parallels between economic nationalisms in Central Europe and East Asia, it focuses on Poland and Hungary and asks why did these countries turn to economic nationalism. The article traces this turn to ideational foundations developed by right‐wing intellectuals over the last two decades, arguing that right‐wing intellectuals believed that liberalism has failed what they conceived of its most important (political) purpose, the need of a radical break with the communist past. Based on a study of the writings and careers of leading Polish and Hungarian right‐wing intellectuals, the article draws attention to the nature of the perceived threat to the nation. It contributes to the sociology of nationalism an analysis of how such a threat emerges and translates into a guiding idea of illiberal economic policies.","[{""name"": ""Mihai Varga"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for East‐European Studies Freie Universität Berlin  Berlin Germany""]}]","[""10.1017/9781108381413"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190600389.001.0001"", ""10.1057/s41290-017-0045-7"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-073018-022351"", ""10.1017/S157401961900035X"", ""10.1080/13563467.2019.1639146"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139087230"", ""10.1086/344411"", ""10.7591/9780801465666"", ""10.1080/01402382.2018.1511958"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12325"", ""10.1177/0308275X7900401307"", ""10.1080/14782804.2018.1498771"", ""10.1177/0888325418791723"", ""10.1515/9781400850365"", ""10.1177/0032329211405440"", ""10.4324/9780203892084"", ""10.1080/01402389408425014"", ""10.1017/gov.2013.22"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-00560-2_11"", ""10.5195/jwsr.2016.626"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511613388"", ""10.1111/amet.12469"", ""10.1080/1356346042000190394"", ""10.2307/422246"", ""10.1080/09692290.2010.507132"", ""10.1111/1468-2478.00235"", ""10.1111/1467-9515.00157"", ""10.1080/09512748908718795"", ""10.1080/09692290.2014.919336"", ""10.1111/nana.12023"", ""10.1057/9781137075673"", ""10.1080/15562948.2017.1317897"", ""10.1080/01629778.2014.962555"", ""10.1332/030557309X435817"", ""10.1111/j.0012-155X.2005.00420.x"", ""10.1556/SocEc.29.2007.1.3"", ""10.4135/9781849209946"", ""10.1080/00220389508422370"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2016.10.001"", ""10.1353/jod.1993.0009"", ""10.1080/05775132.2015.1012402"", ""10.1111/nana.12126"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0048"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2550496"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2007.00282.x"", ""10.3998/mpub.11540"", ""10.1093/pa/gsn048"", ""10.1111/1469-8219.00077"", ""10.1177/0958928704044623"", ""10.1111/j.1758-5899.2011.00146.x"", ""10.1080/09651560801987245"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131752"", ""10.4337/9781783476565.00012"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-70350-3_10"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00164"", ""10.1177/0022185617705684"", ""10.1017/S0047279410000723"", ""10.1080/09512740802650971"", ""10.1177/0958928714545446"", ""10.1163/9789004234307"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990220"", ""10.1080/13563467.2019.1598960"", ""10.1215/01903659-2409703"", ""10.2307/3088399"", ""10.1080/14650045.2020.1734564"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2018.01.008"", ""10.1080/13563460903287322"", ""10.1007/s11186-009-9092-6"", ""10.4324/9781315819006""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S1479244320000475,MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY,0603 World History,"The Theodicy of Growth: John Rawls, Political Economy, and Reasonable Faith","Rediscovery of John Rawls's early interest in theology has recently prompted readings of his philosophical project as a secularized response to earlier theological questions. Intellectual historians have meanwhile begun to historicize Rawls's use of contemporary philosophical resources and his engagement with economic theory. In this article I argue that what held together Rawls's evolving interest in postwar political economy and his commitment to philosophy as reconciliation was his understanding of the need for secular theodicy. In placing Rawls in the intellectual context of a postwar political economy of growth as well as in relation to the history of political thought, including his reading of that history, I defend two claims. First, I argue that Rawls's philosophical ambition is best understood as providing a secular reconciliatory theodicy. Second, I suggest that Rawls's theodicy was initially rendered plausible by the economic background conditions of economic growth that were fractured and fragmented just as Rawls's book was published in 1971. This divergence between text and context helps to account for Rawls's peculiar reception and his own subsequent attempt to insist on the applicability of his theory under radically altered circumstances.","[{""name"": ""Stefan Eich"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S1479244316000159"", ""10.2307/j.ctvfb6z6f"", ""10.1080/1462317X.2016.1211287"", ""10.2307/1959094"", ""10.1515/9781400848515"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226233741.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1597903"", ""10.1353/jhi.2019.0006"", ""10.1086/386242"", ""10.4159/9780674242944""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Religious studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Its principal intention is to reflect on the origins, growth, and recent institutionalization of African American intellectual history while showing the relationship between those developments and broader trends within the US and, at times, European historical profession. This framework is meant as a corrective. African American intellectual history is a distinctive field with its own origins, objectives, and methods. Yet it also demands centering within US and global intellectual history.

10.1093/pastj/gtz055,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,THE DESERT AT THE END OF EMPIRE: AN ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE,"Abstract In the contentious historiography of the Armenian genocide, the desert has been acknowledged by almost everyone as the endpoint of the deportations of hundreds of thousands of Ottoman Armenian citizens in 1915 and the years that followed. Those who use the term ‘genocide’ suggest that this action was tantamount to a death sentence, while those who oppose the term claim that the desert exculpates the Ottoman state. This article unpacks the meaning of the Jazira region — one of the arid regions to which Armenians were sent — and suggests how Ottoman officials used the desert to kill and Armenians used it to survive, mostly as part of nomadic groups among whom they were somewhere between slaves and family members. The desert even came to shape the humanitarian rescue campaign in the wake of the genocide and World War I, as organizations worked to remove Armenian children from the desert and, subsequently, to transform the desert itself by establishing Armenian agricultural colonies. Yet some Armenians stayed, and remain to this day in the Jazira calling themselves Armenian Muslims in honor of their heritage. The desert not only shaped Armenian suffering and survival. The marginal environment also incubated a population of imperial survivors, whose existence did not fit comfortably with post-Ottoman national divisions, or the historiographies influenced by them.","[{""name"": ""Samuel Dolbee"", ""affiliation"": [""Yale University""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

In the northern Apennines, where thrust systems are ramp-dominated and form an emergent imbricate fan, syn-kinematic sedimentation was abundant and accumulated ahead and above each thrust. In the southern Apennines, the far-travelled Lagronegro allochthon achieved its high displacements (&gt;65 km) while the foredeep basin received little sediment. The imbricate fan at the front of the main Himalayan arc developed within a foredeep that experienced high rates of syn-kinematic sedimentation. In contrast, further west, the Salt Range Thrust emerged into a distal, weakly developed foredeep with significantly reduced rates of sediment accumulation. Displacements were strongly localized onto this thrust (c. 25 km displacement) which activated an upper detachment along the syn-orogenic surface. It is an arrested thrust-allochthon. Lateral variations into the adjacent, ramp-dominated but still salt-detached, Jhelum fold-belt are marked by increases in syn-kinematic sedimentation. As sedimentation styles can vary in space and time, individual thrusts and thrust systems can evolve from being allochthon prone to imbricate dominated.","[{""name"": ""Robert W. H.

The purpose of this study is to explore whether global virtual team (GVT) projects raise students' understanding of cultural differences. In addition, it is interesting to know how internationally disruptive events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influence GVT projects.Design/methodology/approachThe research involved two parts: In the first part, a two-wave longitudinal study was conducted to investigate how intercultural sensitivity and intercultural communication competence coevolve within a group of international students enrolled in a virtual business professional project. In the second part, using word clouds and topic modelling on the participants' perceptions, the study investigated whether the sudden disruption caused by the pandemic show similar results in performance, focussing primarily on the resilience of virtual teams. Further, the study explored participants' perceptions towards online learning in higher education institutions as well as the attitude of corporate organizations towards remote working in the post-pandemic years.FindingsThe results confirmed that GVT projects, in fact, do raise students' understanding of cultural differences and the need to adjust their behaviour accordingly in order to engage with their culturally different counterparts effectively. Participants reported an increase in their cognitive, behavioural and affective attributes.Research limitations/implicationsAmong the limitations of this study is the relatively small number of student participants. Furthermore, the number of respondents from India dominated the sample. Since the Indian students were disproportionately affected by the shutdown, causing them to return often to rural areas with poor Internet connectivity, responses concerning the disruption caused by the pandemic may be overriding negative. The same could be said of responses from US-American students, who often rely heavily on-campus employment or whose parents became unemployed during the pandemic, and thus were faced with disproportionate economic insecurity.Practical implicationsThis paper provides insights to the educators and international organizations on how such projects provide the skills essential for reducing costs, accessing knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) across borders, maintaining flexible work schedules and arrangements, and taking advantage of multiple time zones to increase productivity.Originality/valueWhile highlighting the significance of cultural intelligence, this paper investigated how the sudden disruption caused by a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic impacts performance, focussing primarily on the resilience of virtual teams.","[{""name"": ""Stephanie Swartz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Archana Shrivastava"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/249763"", ""10.1002/9781119221548.ch7"", ""10.1080/09585192.2018.1428722"", ""10.1080/00909889309365352"", ""10.5964/ijpr.v13i2.378"", ""10.2478/manment-2018-0032"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(86)90005-2"", ""10.1177/105256299902300302"", ""10.1177/2329490613514598"", ""10.1027/1866-5888/a000075"", ""10.1002/smj.4250141006"", ""10.1177/1028315306287002"", ""10.1016/j.psychsport.2012.04.007"", ""10.1177/1080569908325860"", ""10.1177/1046496406292337"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(77)90045-1"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(78)90036-6"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.02.014"", ""10.1163/9789087904753_004"", ""10.1016/j.hrmr.2005.01.002"", ""10.1108/13632541211279030"", ""10.15390/EB.2016.6195"", ""10.1111/jcc4.12029"", ""10.1111/1467-8624.00164"", ""10.5465/amp.2014.0120"", ""10.1287/orsc.1120.0739"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.59.1.38"", ""10.1177/105960117600100308"", ""10.1177/105960117700200408"", ""10.1016/j.appdev.2018.12.007"", ""10.25304/rlt.v26.2061"", ""10.1080/08975930.2019.1698390"", ""10.1080/01933922.2012.721482"", ""10.1177/1080569908330372"", ""10.1177/1050651910363266"", ""10.1177/1080569905285543"", ""10.21125/iceri.2020.0542"", ""10.1177/2329490619878834"", ""10.1007/s10608-011-9353-3"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190933692.003.0010"", ""10.5815/ijmecs.2015.06.01"", ""10.1177/1080569904273715"", ""10.1080/00909880009365581""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Communication']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1111/russ.12298,RUSSIAN REVIEW,0603 World History,Sexual Citizens in Exile: State-Sponsored Homophobia and Post-Soviet LGBTQI+ Migration,"This article presents a transnational ethnography of a Russian‐speaking LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning) community in New York City addressing the impact of state‐sponsored homophobia in Russia, particularly the 2013 “gay propaganda” ban on international queer migration. Drawing on the theorizations of Russian state‐sponsored homophobia from a perspective of sexual citizenship, the article suggests that emigration through political asylum becomes a new form of the post‐Soviet queer political subject's response to the exclusion from citizenship. Accompanied by the increase in physical and symbolic violence generated by the antigay legislation, the current configuration of sexual citizenship makes staying in Russia unbearable for some non‐heterosexual citizens prompting them to emigrate. In the United States, they attempt to find safety from systemic homophobia and access sexual citizenship rights by applying for political asylum, which is a precarious route in itself as it makes them vulnerable to the structural violence of the U.S. immigration regime. Their willingness to take this risk indicates the significance of both state‐sponsored homophobia and sexual citizenship to their lives. The article also considers another transnational effect of the “gay propaganda” law: the transformation of RUSA LBGT, a New‐York‐City‐based Russian‐speaking LGBTQ community, from a social to activist organization, due to the influx of new migrants seeking asylum in the United States. Thus, it suggests that state‐sponsored homophobia in Russia has de‐territorialized transnational effects such as stimulation of LGBTQ emigration and transformation and mobilization of diasporic communities.","[{""name"": ""ALEXANDRA NOVITSKAYA"", ""affiliation"": [""Ph.D. candidate in Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Stony Brook University (SUNY).""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/ehr.12942,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,"Sanitary infrastructures and the decline of mortality in Germany, 1877-1913†","AbstractClean water provision is considered crucial for eradicating waterborne diseases. However, the benefits of piped water can be limited in environments characterized by the inadequate storage and disposal of waste. This article studies the impact of waterworks and sewerage on mortality in German cities during the period 1877–1913. The results show that the supply of safe drinking water reduced the number of deaths, although to a lower extent than suggested previously. In the absence of efficient systems of sewage removal, contact with faeces and water contamination created a favourable environment for the spread of enteric ailments, offsetting some of the positive effects of waterworks. Moreover, the study shows that sanitary investments had important heterogeneous effects. First, their impact was markedly lower in municipalities with high levels of economic inequality and employment in the textile sector. Second, cities located in non‐Prussian territories experienced lower declines in mortality following the construction of sanitary infrastructures. The results in this article highlight the importance of analysing public health measures jointly as well as their interaction with local socioeconomic and institutional factors to understand historical progress against ill health and premature death.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Gallardo‐Albarrán"", ""affiliation"": [""Wageningen University""]}]","[""10.1086/700766"", ""10.1257/aer.p20161095"", ""10.1093/jeea/jvz052"", ""10.1017/S0022050716000413"", ""10.1162/003355304772839588"", ""10.1017/S0022050700004927"", ""10.1111/ehr.12573"", ""10.1111/ehr.12699"", ""10.1257/jel.53.3.503"", ""10.1353/dem.2005.0002"", ""10.2307/j.ctt3fgxbm"", ""10.3998/mpub.14163"", ""10.1017/S1361491699000131"", ""10.1257/jep.14.1.7"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2007.06.001"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(04)01253-8"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511975912"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817649"", ""10.1257/app.20150431"", ""10.1080/01615440009598952"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2019.1605923"", ""10.1093/shm/11.1.49"", ""10.1017/S0268416099003550"", ""10.1017/S0022050700041620"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2016.03.001"", ""10.1177/036319908501000203"", ""10.2307/2061324"", ""10.1093/qje/qjq010"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511794841.007"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00209"", ""10.1017/S0022050700024633"", ""10.1080/00324728.1975.10410201"", ""10.1111/1468-0297.00270"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7170.001.0001"", ""10.1093/shm/7.3.401"", ""10.1016/S1353-8292(99)00029-5"", ""10.4236/health.2013.512298""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Nursing']","['Nutrition and Dietetics', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1011 护理学', 0.7465), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7157), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7101), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7061), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7035)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7392), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7295)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

The current CHC-based methods for pointer-manipulating programs, however, are not very scalable. This paper proposes a novel translation of pointer-manipulating Rust programs into CHCs, which clears away pointers and heaps by leveraging ownership. We formalize the translation for a simplified core of Rust and prove its correctness. We have implemented a prototype verifier for a subset of Rust and confirmed the effectiveness of our method.","[{""name"": ""Yusuke Matsushita"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Takeshi Tsukada"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Naoki Kobayashi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0304-3975(91)90224-P"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28717-6_7"", ""10.3929/ethz-b-000311092"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_32"", ""10.1145/1953122.1953145"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-23534-9_2"", ""10.1145/1040305.1040327"", ""10.1145/582419.582440"", ""10.1007/3-540-44898-5_4"", ""10.1007/11609773_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02768-1_8"", ""10.1145/286936.286947"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-03359-9_2"", ""10.1145/321978.321991"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2017.8102247"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_14"", ""10.1145/1232420.1232424"", ""10.1145/2254064.2254112"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66706-5_8"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950330"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_15"", ""10.3929/ethz-a-010669150"", ""10.1145/3009837"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8603013"", ""10.2307/2268661"", ""10.1145/3158154"", ""10.1017/S0956796818000151"", ""10.1145/3371113"", ""10.1145/2676726.2676980"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_19"", ""10.14722/ndss.2018.23082"", ""10.1145/1993498.1993525"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24622-0_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4"", ""10.1145/1065010.1065027"", ""10.1109/INDIN.2018.8471992"", ""10.1145/2663171.2663188"", ""10.26226/morressier.604907f41a80aac83ca25d55"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49122-5_2"", ""10.1145/3294032.3294081"", ""10.1145/237721.237727"", ""10.1109/LICS.2001.932480"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-10672-9_11"", ""10.1145/1375581.1375583"", ""10.1109/ASE.2015.77""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

Four palaeogeographical proximal–distal transects are recognized and comprise: (i) the Cantabrian, West Asturian-Leonese, Central Iberian/Central Armorican and Ossa-Morena/North Armorican zones and domains of the Iberian and Armorican massifs, respectively; (ii) the South Armorican Domain and its lateral prolongation into the Thiviers-Payzac unit and the Occitan Domain, including the transect from the Axial, southern and northern Montagne Noire, and the Albigeois-southern Cévennes unit; (iii) the southern and northern sides of the Canigó Massif in the Eastern Pyrenees; and (iv) the External Zone and the External and Internal nappes of Sardinia. Two geodynamic scenarios are recognized controlled by the presence/absence of: (i) the Furongian–Early Ordovician (Toledanian or ‘lacaune normande’) break-up unconformity across the Ossa-Morena/North Armorican and Central Iberian/Central Armorican belts; (ii) the Early–Late Ordovician (Sardic) Phase across the Occitan and Pyrenean domains and SW Sardinia; and (iii) the migration of peaks in trilobite and cinctan (echinoderm) diversity. Other similar palaeogeographical shifts are recognized in zircon provenance patterns, the occurrence of climatically sensitive subtropical facies and mineral indicators across platform–basinal transects along the Gondwana margin. This multidisciplinary framework is proposed as a preliminary step in the quest to produce more tightly constrained Early Paleozoic reconstructions along southwestern Europe.","[{""name"": ""J.

Environmental Malgovernance under Bolsonaro and the Ambiguous Role of the Sustainable Development Goals","Brazil has continuously been in the international spotlight, first as an emerging economy improving social inclusion and sustainable development, then suddenly as a global pariah on environmental governance. Using two case studies – the rising deforestation of the Amazon and the 2019 oil spill on Brazil's Northeast coast – we examine the Bolsonaro administration in the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, to reveal a combination of misgovernance and malgovernance, where transgressions are intentional. The article develops these analytical concepts, explores how environmental malgovernance in Brazil may be addressed and discusses how Bolsonaro's malpractices are internationally challenged, but also condoned.","[{""name"": ""Mairon G.

Although replicas eventually converge, they may diverge temporarily, for instance when the network fails. This makes it difficult for the developer to reason about the object’s properties, and in particular, to prove invariants over its state. For the subclass of state-based distributed systems, we propose a proof methodology for establishing that a given object maintains a given invariant, taking into account any concurrency control. Our approach allows reasoning about individual operations separately. We demonstrate that our rules are sound, and we illustrate their use with some representative examples. We automate the rule using Boogie, an SMT-based tool.","[{""name"": ""Sreeja S.

10.1108/HESWBL-11-2019-0153,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,"Personality traits, teamwork competencies and academic performance among first-year engineering students","PurposeIt is commonly believed that personality traits determine a person's ability to work in a team and academic performance. However, studies have shown inconsistent results with some personality traits better than the other in predicting students' performance in different academic majors. The purpose of this study is to examine the interrelation between personality traits, teamwork competencies and academic performance among first-year first semester engineering students in an Australian university located in the Sarawak state of Malaysia.Design/methodology/approachThe Individual and Team Performance (ITP) metrics were administered among 189 students to gauge their personality traits as well as self-rated and peer-rated teamwork competencies. The correlations between personality traits and teamwork competencies as well as correlations of both the variables to academic performance were subsequently analyzed.FindingsThis study shows no significant difference between the self-rated and peer-rated teamwork competencies. Adventurous trait appears to negatively correlate with teamwork competencies. This study also reveals teamwork competencies as better predictors of academic performance than personality traits. Commitment and focus show relatively larger effect on academic performance. It can be concluded that commitment is the most significant factor to excel in first-year engineering in the university. Therefore, interventions that promote commitment is crucial to academic performance of the first-year first semester engineering students.Practical implicationsThis study promulgates the development of team competencies which are more crucial to academic excellence than personalities. It is useful for the design of team learning activities which lead to the development of teamwork competencies while improving academic performance. It shows that team activities which reinforce commitment especially and focus secondarily, will have significant positive effect on academic performance of the first-year engineering students generally.Originality/valueWhile most studies in this area examine the correlation between personality traits and academic performance, this study is among the very few that looks into the aspect of teamwork competencies. This study also finds its value in its regional significance as such correlational studies are not prevalent in Malaysia.","[{""name"": ""Kuok Ho Daniel Tang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3823/1781"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199861378.003.0012"", ""10.1037/a0016229"", ""10.1177/0308022617691539"", ""10.1006/ceps.2001.1094"", ""10.1080/03055698.2013.825577"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2009.10.002"", ""10.1037/1040-3590.17.2.123"", ""10.1037/a0021212"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2389.2007.00371.x"", ""10.1002/jhrm.21233"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001670"", ""10.1080/02699939208409696"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.257"", ""10.1097/PCC.0000000000001025"", ""10.1016/S0092-6566(03)00046-1"", ""10.2190/C0T7-YX50-F71V-00CW"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-374946-8.10008-1"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.01.055"", ""10.1016/S0191-8869(98)00245-1"", ""10.1023/A:1007714801558"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2016.12.021"", ""10.1037/amp0000295"", ""10.1111/apps.12207"", ""10.1080/10511253.2012.679362"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2013.06.003"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190127"", ""10.1080/02602938.2018.1526256"", ""10.1016/j.colegn.2014.05.001"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.84.4.890"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.81.3.524"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.82.4.469"", ""10.5465/amle.2014.0124"", ""10.1037/pspp0000089"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00047.x"", ""10.1037/amp0000298"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2007.01.006"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2010.11.026"", ""10.1007/s11165-016-9602-2"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-08-2017-0139"", ""10.1002/job.680"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.84.1.165"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2015.12.011"", ""10.1037/a0017908"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00280.x"", ""10.1037/a0013314"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2006.03.001"", ""10.1080/03075079.2015.1034258""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)]]"

10.1111/hith.12269,HISTORY AND THEORY,0603 World History,PREDICTIONS WITHOUT FUTURES,"ABSTRACTModernity held sacred the aspirational formula of the open future: a promise of human determination that doubles as an injunction to control. Today, the banner of this plannable future is borne by technology. Allegedly impersonal, neutral, and exempt from disillusionment with ideology, belief in technological change saturates the present horizon of historical futures. Yet I argue that this is exactly how today's technofutures enact a hegemony of closure and sameness. In particular, the growing emphasis on prediction as AI's skeleton key to all social problems constitutes what religious studies calls cosmograms: universalizing models that govern how facts and values relate to each other, providing a common and normative point of reference. In a predictive paradigm, social problems are made conceivable only as objects of calculative control—control that can never be fulfilled but that persists as an eternally deferred and recycled horizon. I show how this technofuture is maintained not so much by producing literally accurate predictions of future events but through ritualized demonstrations of predictive time.","[{""name"": ""Sun‐ha Hong"", ""affiliation"": [""Simon Fraser University""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

In Brazil, indigenous, Afro‐Brazilian quilombolas and other racialised communities have suffered disproportionately under Bolsonaro's hands‐off policy during the pandemic. We argue that, far from happenstance, this policy fits into a form of necropolitics towards forest peoples. Drawing from Achille Mbembe's seminal work, this article analyses how underlying (and sometimes overt) racism, cultural depredation, and government‐supported deforestation constitute an assault now catalysed by the pandemic. Understanding forest peoples' disproportionate deaths in perspective is critical for addressing their growing vulnerability and the broader politics currently at play.","[{""name"": ""Gabriela Russo Lopes"", ""affiliation"": [""CEDLA University of Amsterdam  The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Mairon G Bastos Lima"", ""affiliation"": [""Chalmers University of Technology  Sweden""]}]","[""10.1007/s10729-020-09505-5"", ""10.1590/1809-4422asoc20200123vu2020l3id"", ""10.5209/geop.69349"", ""10.1017/S0376892919000213"", ""10.1215/08992363-15-1-11"", ""10.1215/9781478007227""]","['Environmental Science', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Nature and Landscape Conservation', 'Anthropology', 'General Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7446), ('0909 草学', 0.741)]]"

Before the early 1990s, the diet of most Chileans was poor in animal proteins and calcium. Today, Chileans enjoy a diet characterized by high consumption of meat and dairy products. The rapid rise in consumption of these products can be attributed to various factors: Chile belatedly joining the international agribusiness revolution; government support from the 1930s to the 1960s; increasing GDP per capita; macro-economic stability; changes in consumption habits; trade liberalization; and the fall in food prices, as both meat and milk had high income elasticity. These revolutions in both production and consumption have greatly improved the nutrition of the Chilean population and partly explain the improvement in Chile’s biological well-being.","[{""name"": ""Manuel Llorca-Jaña"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad de Valparaíso""]}, {""name"": ""Ricardo Nazer"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad de Valparaíso""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel Morales"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad de Valparaíso""]}, {""name"": ""Juan Navarrete-Montalvo"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad de Valparaíso""]}]","[""10.1007/978-1-4615-0811-3_1"", ""10.1079/phn2001283"", ""10.7440/histcrit62.2016.06"", ""10.1093/ereh/heu003"", ""10.1353/tech.2001.0150"", ""10.1016/j.endeavour.2009.04.008"", ""10.37801/ajad2007.4.2.5"", ""10.3098/ah.2010.84.2.176"", ""10.1080/00076791.2016.1155558"", ""10.1111/joac.12291"", ""10.1111/ehr.12702"", ""10.3945/ajcn.114.084764"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9523.1989.tb00360.x"", ""10.4067/s0717-71942017000100003"", ""10.1006/jhge.1995.0018"", ""10.1080/07373938908916590"", ""10.20506/rst.16.2.1037"", ""10.4067/s0718-10432018005001602"", ""10.1016/j.ehb.2018.03.004"", ""10.1017/s0212610918000198"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729937.013.0021"", ""10.4067/s0717-71942018000200455"", ""10.4324/9780203444894"", ""10.2307/2938388"", ""10.1111/j.1753-4887.2004.tb00084.x"", ""10.2307/1349725"", ""10.1484/m.rurhe-eb.4.00169"", ""10.4067/s0718-16202014000300005"", ""10.1017/s1368980000000070"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwr010"", ""10.18232/alhe.955""]",['Agricultural and Biological Sciences'],['General Agricultural and Biological Sciences'],"[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7446), ('0909 草学', 0.741)]]"
10.1108/HESWBL-05-2020-0112,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,Investigating work-integrated learning and its relevance to skills development in degree apprenticeships,"PurposePrevious research suggests that higher education provision, the government's knowledge-based economic agenda and the attributes employers look for in graduates are not always aligned, leading to a skill shortage and the production of graduates who are not “work ready”. Degree apprenticeships (DAs) are well placed to address this gap because employers are involved in both the design and delivery of higher education and work with higher education institutions (HEIs) to develop the skills both parties believe graduates need through work-integrated learning (WIL). This paper will address how DAs can be utilised to that purpose.Design/methodology/approachThis paper draws on data collected from students, ranging from their first to final years, enrolled in the Chartered Manager Degree Apprenticeship (CMDA) programme at a higher education provider in London, UK. The national context of the UK is crucial both because of how DAs have been introduced by the government; how the pedagogical implications defer from other national contexts and work based provision and also because there are clear contrasts in how the private and public sector in the UK are “using” degree apprentices. The authors adopted an exploratory research design using semi-structured interviews and focus groups.FindingsThe authors argue that a reflective approach in assessed coursework, in conjunction with an explicit focus on the skill development of students, can enhance the experience of degree apprentices completing WIL modules. The authors highlight the potential of WIL modules in advancing the ability of degree apprentices to reflect on their practice while they are working and studying, a process which can have long- term benefits to their professional identity. The authors draw attention to the affordances given to apprentices to develop their professional identity drawing comparisons between the public and private sector in the UK.Originality/valueThis paper adds to the work on DAs and WIL currently being undertaken in the UK. By exploring the case study of a cohort of DAs engaging in productive reflection with regards to the skills they develop at the workplace and in the classroom, the authors point to a way in which module development can integrate such reflective elements.","[{""name"": ""Iro Konstantinou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elizabeth Miller"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/02602938.2019.1639613"", ""10.1177/1028315307303542"", ""10.1080/02602930600679050"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-06-2016-0038"", ""10.1108/ET-10-2015-0091"", ""10.1080/03098260600927575"", ""10.1080/13636820.2016.1143866"", ""10.1080/03054980701782098"", ""10.1002/berj.3218"", ""10.1080/13639080600776870"", ""10.1080/0309877X.2012.699516"", ""10.1080/14681369900200057"", ""10.1177/1077800407301175"", ""10.1080/13636829800200043"", ""10.1093/oep/gpq002"", ""10.1080/13583883.2000.9967007"", ""10.1108/JWAM-10-2015-003"", ""10.1177/0891241604266988"", ""10.1177/1468794106058866"", ""10.1093/oep/gpv070"", ""10.1177/1609406917733847"", ""10.1080/02680930500108718"", ""10.3138/9781442686410-016"", ""10.1162/0011526054622015"", ""10.1002/berj.3222""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

In deeply buried reservoirs, chlorite coats on sand grains prevent the growth of quartz cements and lead to anomalously good reservoir quality. By contrast, an excess of chlorite – for example, in clay-rich siltstone and sandstone – leads to blocked pore throats and very low permeability. Determining which compositional type is present, how it occurs spatially, and quantifying the many and varied habits of chlorite that are of commercial importance remains a challenge. With the advent of automated techniques based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM), it is possible to provide instant phase identification and mapping of entire thin sections of rock. The resulting quantitative mineralogy and rock fabric data can be compared with well logs and core analysis data. We present here a completely novel Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by SCANning electron microscopy (QEMSCAN®) SEM–energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) methodology to differentiate, quantify and image 11 different compositional types of chlorite based on Fe : Mg ratios using thin sections of rocks and grain mounts of cuttings or loose sediment. No other analytical technique, or combination of techniques, is capable of easily quantifying and imaging different compositional types of chlorite. Here we present examples of chlorite from seven different geological settings analysed using QEMSCAN® SEM–EDS. By illustrating the reliability of identification under automated analysis, and the ability to capture realistic textures in a fully digital format, we can clearly visualize the various forms of chlorite. This new approach has led to the creation of a digital chlorite library, in which we have co-registered optical and SEM-based images, and validated the mineral identification with complimentary techniques such as X-ray diffraction. This new methodology will be of interest and use to all those concerned with the identification and formation of chlorite in sandstones and the effects that diagenetic chlorite growth may have had on reservoir quality. The same approach may be adopted for other minerals (e.g. carbonates) with major element compositional variability that may influence the porosity and permeability of sandstone reservoirs.","[{""name"": ""R.

Extensional fault-propagation folding, rotation and uplift produced gravitationally driven scarp collapse of the incompetent and mudstone-dominated uppermost Mungaroo Formation. Scarp degradation occurred along the entire extent of the footwalls of three major faults within the research area. Individual segments display listric fault surfaces in cross-section and scoop-shaped scars in three dimensions. The listric collapse faults dip towards the erosional scarp and sole out at different levels within the upper Triassic Mungaroo Formation. Footwall crestal collapse formed coalesced, scoop-shaped degradation scarps with Mungaroo Formation debris deposited as wedges within the adjacent hanging-wall synclines. Maximum scarp degradation occurred at the fault centres and decreased towards the fault tips. This study proposes new three-dimensional evolutionary structural models for the fault-scarp degradation in the central Exmouth Plateau.","[{""name"": ""Awad Bilal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ken McClay"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicola Scarselli"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2016.05.029"", ""10.1130/B26536.1"", ""10.1071/AJ14035"", ""10.1144/0050107"", ""10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2017.05.022"", ""10.1144/petgeo.2.3.219"", ""10.1144/0041159"", ""10.1029/2003JF000115"", ""10.1080/08120090701769472"", ""10.1029/97JB03295"", ""10.1144/gsjgs.152.5.0883"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2117.2011.00524.x"", ""10.1111/bre.12158"", ""10.1016/0025-3227(88)90051-5"", ""10.1071/AJ15012"", ""10.1046/j.1440-0952.2000.00776.x"", ""10.1016/S0037-0738(01)00165-8"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2117.2000.00121.x"", ""10.1144/GSL.MEM.2003.020.01.29"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2012.04.021"", ""10.1016/S0191-8141(99)00072-3"", ""10.1080/08120090500100077"", ""10.1029/149GM03"", ""10.1144/SP444.13"", ""10.1002/2015TC004103"", ""10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2016.05.018"", ""10.1016/S0264-8172(98)00071-3"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020<0853:MARMEE>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1144/GSL.MEM.1991.014.01.03"", ""10.1016/j.jsg.2005.11.009"", ""10.1016/S0191-8141(01)00118-3"", ""10.1016/j.jog.2005.07.006"", ""10.1016/j.sedgeo.2006.01.006"", ""10.1190/INT-2016-0133.1"", ""10.1306/04041615125"", ""10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.06.033"", ""10.1144/0050091"", ""10.1016/j.jseaes.2012.12.020"", ""10.1306/St44623C8"", ""10.1306/06280707014"", ""10.1306/M59582C2"", ""10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2015.04.020"", ""10.1071/AJ13047"", ""10.1071/AJ01016"", ""10.1002/jgrb.50298"", ""10.1130/L445.1"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(2000)112<1877:FPFIES>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1306/08190201041"", ""10.1144/GSL.MEM.1991.014.01.08"", ""10.1144/SP292.3"", ""10.1080/08120099.2016.1243579"", ""10.1016/j.jsg.2016.12.009""]","['Engineering', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Mechanics of Materials', 'Geology', 'Earth-Surface Processes']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)], [('0709 地质学', 0.7376), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7361)]]"

Over the last decades, these spores have become increasingly important as a proxy to study the Pleistocene and Holocene megafauna. Although the number of types used in palaeoecology is relatively small, there is a wide range of coprophilous fungal taxa whose utility in palaeoenvironmental reconstruction remains under-researched. However, environmental and taphonomic factors influencing preservation and recovery of these spores are still poorly understood. Furthermore, our understanding of whether and how spores are transported across the landscape is limited. Dung fungal spore presence appears to correlate well with megaherbivore presence. However, depending on the site, some limitations can remain to quantitative reconstructions of megaherbivore abundance from dung fungal spore records. The presence of dung fungal spores is often more significant than their absence and variation in abundance with time should be interpreted with caution. Correlation with other proxies may provide a promising way forward. The majority of studies using dung fungal spores as an indicator for large herbivore abundance are of records of Late Pleistocene and Holocene age, with a focus on Late Quaternary megafaunal extinction. However, more research could potentially extend records further back in time.","[{""name"": ""Eline N. van Asperen"", ""affiliation"": [""School of History, Classics and Archaeology, Newcastle

East Africa, Decolonisation, and the Global History of the Mid-Twentieth Century","AbstractThis article proposes that there is a gap in our current understanding of the globalising and deglobalising dynamics of mid-twentieth-century East Africa, one that might be addressed by consolidating and taking forward recent developments in the historiography of decolonisation. Recent work by international historians has recovered the connected world of the 1940s to 1960s: the era of new postcolonial states, the ‘Bandung moment’, pan-African cooperation, and the early Cold War. Yet East Africa is less prominent in these histories than we might expect, despite the vibrancy of current work on this period in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. Bringing these two fields into dialogue, through an explicitly regional East African framework and with a particular focus on individual lives, expands our understanding not only of the ‘globalisation of decolonisation’ but also of the deglobalising dynamics of the following decades that are frequently reduced to a history of global economic crisis.","[{""name"": ""Ismay Milford"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gerard McCann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emma Hunter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Branch"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/00267929-2920051"", ""10.1080/09592290108406215"", ""10.1080/17531055.2012.755314"", ""10.1017/S1740022817000262"", ""10.56279/TZA20210922"", ""10.1111/nana.12448"", ""10.1017/S0021853712000230"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199899142.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781316659083"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wpmb1"", ""10.1017/S0018246X18000407"", ""10.2307/2168387"", ""10.2979/transition.106a.12"", ""10.1080/14662047208447155"", ""10.5040/9781350051829"", ""10.1093/ahr/123.3.728"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198713197.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316221679"", ""10.2307/j.ctv224txv2"", ""10.1093/jsh/shz101"", ""10.1017/9781316946350"", ""10.1017/S0020859000113859"", ""10.1215/9780822372325"", ""10.1017/S0018246X19000712"", ""10.1080/13696815.2019.1635437"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139032544"", ""10.2307/j.ctv21ptt61"", ""10.1080/17531055.2015.1091639"", ""10.2307/3097615"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316104620"", ""10.1017/S0021853708003915"", ""10.1353/mod.2006.0061"", ""10.1017/9781139028769"", ""10.1080/09555803.2019.1646785"", ""10.1093/jsh/shz098"", ""10.1093/ahr/rhy577"", ""10.2307/j.ctv224tszp""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

However, there has not yet been much systematic investigation of the existing literature tracing the trends, changes and developments in employability research. This paper aims to fill this void by analyzing data obtained from the Scopus dataset from 1972 to 2019.Design/methodology/approachA total of 1,703 Scopus-indexed articles were filtered from 7,885 documents. The results reflect a rapidly emerging literature on employability, given the worldwide interest in this topic. Using descriptive statistics and bibliometric analyses, the review identified trends in employability research, whose impact has been sustained for several decades.FindingsWith science mapping, the conceptual structure of scientific disciplines was visualized, highlighting three main schools of thought including employers’ requirements and higher education institutions’ preparation; the antecedents of employability; and the role of work-integrated learning in enhancing employability.Originality/valueThe paper calls for more integrative research focusing on personal agency with the development of career paths inside organizations as well as for a more focus on a multilevel perspective exploring both individuals' and organizations’ perceptions.","[{""name"": ""Ngoan Thi Dinh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luong Dinh Hai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hiep-Hung Pham"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/SU12155900"", ""10.1111/apps.12082"", ""10.4102/sajip.v44i0.1503"", ""10.1504/IJEBR.2019.096582"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1995807"", ""10.1108/CDI-08-2016-0135"", ""10.1080/01425692.2013.838415"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04140-9"", ""10.1108/ET-06-2016-0100"", ""10.3390/educsci12040255"", ""10.1108/IJEM-05-2016-0122"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2019.02.013"", ""10.1177/1059601115617086"", ""10.1108/CDI-12-2014-0162"", ""10.1080/07294360802444347"", ""10.21153/jtlge2019vol10no1art785"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2015.07.002"", ""10.1108/ET-06-2016-0111"", ""10.1177/1469787415574050"", ""10.1007/s10734-014-9760-y"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2011.05.010"", ""10.1177/0894845314533420"", ""10.1002/job.1996"", ""10.1016/j.bar.2006.08.003"", ""10.1002/job.214"", ""10.1080/03075079.2015.1101754"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2015.04.007"", ""10.1111/1748-8583.12206"", ""10.1080/02680939.2016.1268271"", ""10.1007/s12186-015-9131-6"", ""10.1080/09585192.2014.971846"", ""10.1108/CDI-06-2017-0098"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-12-2017-0102"", ""10.1007/s10775-015-9288-4"", ""10.3390/su11082401"", ""10.3102/0034654319830380"", ""10.3390/su12051947"", ""10.21153/jtlge2019vol10no2art827"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-04-2015-0015"", ""10.1039/C8RP00105G"", ""10.1080/00221341.2015.1085588"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2015.07.001"", ""10.1108/ET-08-2014-0093"", ""10.1080/03075079.2013.842221"", ""10.1080/07294360.2016.1139551"", ""10.1007/s10734-016-0080-2"", ""10.1007/s10734-017-0216-z"", ""10.1080/13562517.2015.1136281"", ""10.1080/07294360.2016.1229270"", ""10.1080/03075079.2013.842210"", ""10.1057/s41262-018-0117-1"", ""10.1007/s10798-015-9319-y"", ""10.1016/j.brq.2016.02.001"", ""10.1108/CDI-04-2015-0056"", ""10.24191/ajue.v15i3.7803"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66954-0"", ""10.11591/ijere.v11i1.22145"", ""10.1177/0950422216663719"", ""10.1177/1477878515598060"", ""10.1108/ET-02-2014-0017"", ""10.22452/mojem/vol8no1.1"", ""10.5267/j.msl.2019.10.005"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-151-4-200908180-00135"", ""10.1007/s11192-015-1765-5"", ""10.1007/s10734-019-00372-w"", ""10.17015/ejbe.2021.028.03"", ""10.1080/07294360.2018.1446415"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-04-2018-0049"", ""10.1080/08832323.2018.1545629"", ""10.1007/s11192-021-03965-4"", ""10.1080/02673843.2016.1234401"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2017.01.005"", ""10.1080/1360080X.2015.1126896"", ""10.1108/00400910710754435"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2015.01.001"", ""10.1007/s12186-011-9072-7"", ""10.1177/00220574211016444"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-02-2015-0005"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57168-7_2"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2007.12.001"", ""10.1007/s10734-015-9903-9"", ""10.1080/03075079.2014.977859"", ""10.36253/978-88-5518-155-6.09"", ""10.2991/assehr.k.200813.009"", ""10.1108/ET-07-2018-0154"", ""10.1057/hep.2011.26"", ""10.1108/ET-05-2016-0090"", ""10.1080/13639080.2014.900167"", ""10.1080/00071005.2015.1128526"", ""10.1080/13562517.2016.1198761"", ""10.1080/03075079.2019.1602757"", ""10.1080/13594320344000237"", ""10.1080/1359432X.2015.1007130"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10377-8_13"", ""10.1108/ET-03-2017-0037"", ""10.1108/PR-05-2014-0100"", ""10.1080/13639080.2015.1102210"", ""10.1177/1094428114562629""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Education']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

This often limits the application of verification techniques, as writing formal specifications is an error-prone and time-consuming manual task. To facilitate this, we present , a framework for applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive formal specifications (in temporal logics) from unstructured natural language. In particular, we introduce a new methodology to detect and resolve the inherent ambiguity of system requirements in natural language: we utilize LLMs to map subformulas of the formalization back to the corresponding natural language fragments of the input. Users iteratively add, delete, and edit these sub-translations to amend erroneous formalizations, which is easier than manually redrafting the entire formalization. The framework is agnostic to specific application domains and can be extended to similar specification languages and new neural models. We perform a user study to obtain a challenging dataset, which we use to run experiments on the quality of translations. We provide an open-source implementation, including a web-based frontend.","[{""name"": ""Matthias Cosler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Hahn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Mendoza"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frederik Schmitt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Caroline Trippel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013159"", ""10.1007/BFb0058022"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-37703-7_18"", ""10.5281/ZENODO.3888410"", ""10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27068"", ""10.1145/3428269"", ""10.15607/RSS.2018.XIV.067"", ""10.1145/1368088.1368094"", ""10.1016/S1571-0661(04)00253-1"", ""10.1145/3510003.3510171"", ""10.1145/1062455.1062526"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-30206-3_12"", ""10.1007/11837862_18"", ""10.1109/SFCS.1977.32"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-79876-5_2"", ""10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x"", ""10.1007/b137011""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Information Systems', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"
10.1111/ehr.12876,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Women's labour force participation in nineteenth-century England and Wales: evidence from the 1881 census enumerators' books,"AbstractThis article uses a new source of data, namely the full sample of the 1881 census enumerators’ books, to study female labour force participation. It examines the interaction between labour demand and supply to gauge their relative importance in determining female labour force participation rates (LFPRs). Three main findings emerge from the current article. First, there is an unmistakable link between labour demand and female LFPRs. High levels of female labour force participation are found in areas where there were industries with ample demand for female labour. Second, supply‐side factors also had clear effects on female LFPRs. However, they can only operate within the limit imposed by the demand‐side conditions. Third, female migration did not fundamentally change the spatial patterns of female LFPRs. Overall, this article argues that the demand side of the female labour market was the most important factor in determining female LFPRs in nineteenth‐century England and Wales.","[{""name"": ""Xuesheng You"", ""affiliation"": [""Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure University of Cambridge""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780198805830.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13545701.2012.725942"", ""10.1093/past/143.1.167"", ""10.1017/S1361491697000099"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00075"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2004.00292.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495779"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9957.1949.tb00900.x"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2018.09.003"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198204008.001.0001"", ""10.1086/451941"", ""10.2307/2172821"", ""10.1017/S0268416000003908"", ""10.1016/0014-4983(79)90010-X"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300151800.001.0001"", ""10.1093/hwj/23.1.59"", ""10.2307/2598131"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbw001"", ""10.2307/2597872"", ""10.1017/S0020859000114786"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511780455"", ""10.1080/13545701.2012.746465"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511522659"", ""10.1017/S0022050705050011"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2014.968181"", ""10.4324/9780203401958"", ""10.1177/036319909702200402"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2008.00459.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02221.x"", ""10.1080/03071028808567710"", ""10.4324/9780203167991"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195039573.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03071028608567640"", ""10.2307/2598407"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511599446"", ""10.2307/2598447"", ""10.1515/9781846151507"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818196"", ""10.1515/9781782040071"", ""10.3366/hac.1998.10.1-3.17""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

In this paper, I establish that ethnonationalism—a set of beliefs concerning what it means to be a “true” American—was also a significant factor in the estimations of White Americans when casting their vote for president in 2016. Data from a nationally representative sample of White Americans show that ethnonationalism was a robust predictor of vote choice for Trump even after controlling for predictors known to shape vote choice, including economic assessments, sexist attitudes, racial resentment, status threat, and sociodemographic indicators. These results indicate that ethnonationalism, although correlated with some of these factors, operated primarily as an independent factor that shaped White vote choice. The findings have important implications concerning the electoral activation of White majorities concerned about the perceived threat that demographic change poses to American national identity.","[{""name"": ""Jack Thompson"", ""affiliation"": [""Doctoral School Nottingham Trent University Nottingham UK""]}]","[""10.1177/0002716218811309"", ""10.2307/2131064"", ""10.2307/2111651"", ""10.2307/2669291"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12325"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9446-8"", ""10.2307/2131685"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195137422.003.0004"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2580627"", ""10.1037/a0035403"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2008.00423.x"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00281"", ""10.1017/S1049096518000367"", ""10.1002/9781118900772.etrds0155"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2009.05.021"", ""10.1017/9781108645157"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00564.x"", ""10.1017/S0021875899006180"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12547"", ""10.1177/1368430216677304"", ""10.15195/v5.a10"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1177/1368430217741203"", ""10.1002/polq.12737"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0022"", ""10.4324/9780203876558"", ""10.2979/chiricu.1.2.27"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00577.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226353159.001.0001"", ""10.1093/poq/nfy003"", ""10.1093/socrel/srx070""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

We show that nationalism is crucial to both, the interpretation of Weber’s Protestant Ethic and empirical tests thereof. For late nineteenth-century century Prussia we reject Weber’s suggestion that Protestantism mattered due to an “ascetic compulsion to save.” Moreover, we find that income levels, savings, and literacy rates differed between Germans and Poles, not between Protestants and Catholics, using pooled OLS and IV regressions. We suggest that this result is due to anti-Polish discrimination.","[{""name"": ""Felix Kersting"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Iris Wohnsiedler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nikolaus Wolf"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1162/REST_a_00139"", ""10.1353/sof.2001.0096"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2017.01.011"", ""10.2307/1387685"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199276561.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01615440.2013.852370"", ""10.1017/S0022050719000378"", ""10.1093/qje/qjr002"", ""10.1080/13668250500488827"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-86088-1"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2012.02495.x"", ""10.29173/cjs6385"", ""10.1093/jeea/jvx052"", ""10.1086/701682"", ""10.2307/1519761"", ""10.13109/9783666370304"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195056112.001.0001"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00368"", ""10.1162/qjec.2008.123.2.747"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2016.07.007"", ""10.1111/jeea.12123"", ""10.1177/1536867X20953572"", ""10.1177/14687950122232495"", ""10.1111/ajps.12328"", ""10.1162/qjec.2008.123.3.905"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3449578"", ""10.1017/S0022050707000125"", ""10.1162/qjec.2009.124.2.531"", ""10.1111/jeea.12117"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2019.102429"", ""10.1093/qje/qjy011"", ""10.17433/978-3-17-023206-8"", ""10.1257/aer.96.5.1652"", ""10.1017/S0022050701028042"", ""10.1086/421167"", ""10.1017/S0022050709001144""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Monitoring cracks opening on concrete bridges is a key aspect for structural health assessment. Digital image processing, combined with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and photogrammetry, allows for non-contact 3D reconstruction of cracks, reducing costs and potential unsafe factors involved in manual inspections. This paper presents a flexible procedure based on UAV photogrammetry for accurate evaluation of cracks geometry, that can be implemented for periodic structural monitoring. Stereo-pair of images, acquired with UAVs close to the cracked surface, are used to build a scaled photogrammetric model through Structure-from-Motion. Cracks are detected on images by image binarization and digital image processing techniques. Thereafter, one single image is used to reconstruct crack 3D geometry, by back-projecting crack image coordinates on a 3D model of the object. This can be built from the current stereo-pair of images, or based on an existing photogrammetric model, in the case of a periodic monitoring set-up. Crack width is accurately estimated in 3D world. The procedure is tested and evaluated in a case study, obtaining millimetric accurate results, which is in line with the average ground sample distance of the images employed. Results highlight the potentials of UAVs and photogrammetry not only for bridge inspections and damages localization, but also for accurately evaluating cracks geometry and helping structural engineers to assess structure health conditions.","[{""name"": ""F.

Pelagic sediments from the Cretaceous greenhouse climate phase provide a valuable archive for sea-level change. Although sea-level variations are of negligible amplitude compared with depositional water-depths, direct physical proxy data are based on higher and coarser siliciclastic input during sea-level lowstand and regressions, and include coarser grain size and grain-size parameters as well as the heavy mineral and clay content. Chemical proxies that relate to siliciclastics are manganese, titanium and zirconium, often normalized v. aluminium. Further proxies provide the ratios of strontium v. calcium, controlled by shelf carbonate erosion, and partly redox-sensitive elements like uranium and thorium. From a mineralogical point of view, the total amount of siliciclastics and their diversity relating to heavy minerals provides sea-level information in hemipelagites, as well as the phyllosilicate content v. biogenic pelagic background deposition of carbonate and siliceous microfossils in pelagites. In addition, measurements of gamma ray emission, linked to U, Th, K content and magnetic susceptibility may relate to sea-level cycles and various other more climate-dependent proxies like oxygen isotopes of fossil calcite and compositional maturity of hemipelagic sediments.","[{""name"": ""Michael Wagreich"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Veronika Koukal"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1144/jgs2013-015"", ""10.2110/sedred.2018.4.4"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2011.06.029"", ""10.1126/science.1148777"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.03.004"", ""10.1016/0025-3227(93)90150-T"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.09.017"", ""10.1002/2013EF000188"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-85916-8"", ""10.1016/j.jseaes.2013.04.017"", ""10.18814/epiiugs/2013/v36i3/002"", ""10.1130/G31081.1"", ""10.5194/cp-10-1001-2014"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2015.02.022"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2013.12.024"", ""10.1016/j.cretres.2015.11.009"", ""10.1016/j.cretres.2015.04.010"", ""10.1146/annurev.ea.14.050186.002031"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2011.04.024"", ""10.1016/j.cretres.2011.12.005"", ""10.1130/G32701.1"", ""10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.01.003"", ""10.1086/607150"", ""10.1002/9781444304015.ch6"", ""10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.12.007"", ""10.1126/science.235.4793.1156"", ""10.5194/cp-8-1323-2012"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.09.008"", ""10.1007/s00531-018-1670-2"", ""10.1126/science.194.4270.1121"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-53000-4.00005-6"", ""10.1130/B30934.1"", ""10.1016/bs.sats.2018.08.004"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-59425-9.00004-4"", ""10.29041/strat.04.2.17"", ""10.1016/j.cretres.2004.11.011"", ""10.1016/j.palaeo.2005.10.003"", ""10.1016/bs.sats.2018.08.005"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-53000-4.00004-4"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2010.06.027"", ""10.1038/ncomms15532"", ""10.1144/jgs.158.4.685"", ""10.1002/dep2.6"", ""10.2475/ajs.301.2.112"", ""10.1073/pnas.1800891115"", ""10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.05.036"", ""10.1130/G131A.1"", ""10.1016/0037-0738(95)00052-6"", ""10.1144/jgs.157.2.447"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-03454-y"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2008.03.021"", ""10.1038/nature21402"", ""10.1130/G34510.1"", ""10.1016/bs.sats.2018.08.002"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-59425-9.00007-X"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.11.015"", ""10.1029/2012PA002286"", ""10.1029/90JB02015"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(2003)031<0585:LCCOLR>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1126/science.1116412"", ""10.5670/oceanog.2011.26"", ""10.1111/sed.12437"", ""10.2110/sepmsp.091.199"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2015.11.023"", ""10.2110/sepmsp.091.137"", ""10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.06.018"", ""10.1038/ngeo1875"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2005.03.015"", ""10.1016/j.jspi.2015.10.006"", ""10.1029/93RG03257"", ""10.1016/0037-0738(95)00060-7"", ""10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.08.026"", ""10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.10.045"", ""10.2110/jsr.2013.77"", ""10.2110/csp.05.08"", ""10.12789/geocanj.2015.42.070"", ""10.1038/215015a0"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-5016-1_22"", ""10.1016/0277-3791(87)90003-5"", ""10.1038/35038000"", ""10.1073/pnas.1810141115"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.1998.129.01.19"", ""10.1016/j.gca.2004.02.018"", ""10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.03.033"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2016.11.002"", ""10.1127/0078-0421/2012/0016"", ""10.2110/sepmsp.091.073"", ""10.1016/j.cretres.2012.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.sedgeo.2010.06.025"", ""10.1126/science.aad2622"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-53000-4.00011-1"", ""10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.08.029"", ""10.1127/0078-0421/2014/0038"", ""10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.08.014"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2010.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.12.048"", ""10.1016/j.quaint.2017.12.038"", ""10.1146/annurev-earth-042711-105521""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],"['Geophysics', 'Paleontology', 'Geochemistry and Petrology']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7076), ('0709 地质学', 0.7071)], [('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.7485), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7296)]]"

The data was analysed using Partial Least Squares regression.FindingsEducation and employed teaching methods, in particular, positively affect students' attitudes towards entrepreneurship, their perceived capability to start a business and indirectly influence entrepreneurial intentions. However, attendance of entrepreneurship-related courses itself does not enhance perceived control and has no significant effect on personal attitudes. The study also shows that cultural context has a positive influence on students' attitudes towards entrepreneurship and, therefore, indirectly impacts their intentions to become entrepreneurs.Research limitations/implicationsFirstly, the students participating in the study were from one country. And secondly, the paper deals with pre-educational entrepreneurial intentions.Practical implicationsThe study suggests that a practice-based approach to entrepreneurship education is a key to raising entrepreneurial awareness of young people in countries whose national cultures are built on collectivist values.Originality/valueThe results of the study are of value for teaching staff, who can actually influence students' entrepreneurial self-awareness, and for university management in the context of contemporary education reforms and the latest requirements to education process.","[{""name"": ""Olena Mykolenko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Inna Ippolitova"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hanna Doroshenko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Svitlana Strapchuk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1080/08870446.2011.613995"", ""10.1080/14632440110094632"", ""10.1057/jibs.2013.15"", ""10.1108/00400911211244678"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2006.12.016"", ""10.1080/19186444.2018.1507877"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12065"", ""10.1108/00400910210449231"", ""10.1007/s11747-014-0403-8"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00396.x"", ""10.1177/1465750316648576"", ""10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00033-0"", ""10.1007/s11365-005-6674-2"", ""10.1080/08985620903233929"", ""10.1111/1467-9310.00288"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2009.00304.x"", ""10.1016/j.iedeen.2017.01.001"", ""10.1787/d7e3878d-en"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2009.08.002"", ""10.1007/s10843-010-0071-9"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12025"", ""10.5465/amle.9.2.zqr169"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.240"", ""10.7814/jeen5v5p3wd"", ""10.1007/s11365-012-0246-z""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Environmental Science']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)]]"
10.1093/ehr/ceab166,ENGLISH HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,"The Nationalisation of British History: Historians, Nationalism and the Myths of 1940","Abstract Neither the idea that Britain ‘stood alone’ in 1940, nor that the British war was a ‘people’s war’, were at all common during the Second World War. If anything was thought to be ‘alone’, it was the empire, though the more common view was that the empire always had allies. ‘People’s war’ was a rare synonym for ‘total war’ and was sometimes used in an internationalist sense of a war of many peoples, and as the sort of war Britain should be, but was not, fighting. However, from 1945 a national ‘alone’ came into usage, for example by Churchill; but only from the 1960s was it a commonplace in history books. ‘People’s war’ became more widely used in histories written in the 1960s, which defined it in a national progressive sense, although the term did not become common until the 1990s. Both ideas were essentially the creations of historians, who nationalised the history of what was an imperial and internationalist war, often turning it into a radically different domestic story focused on a national Home Front (ignoring the many imperial home fronts), a story which marginalised the military, foreign and political history of the war, and indeed the social history of the military as well. Historians later assumed that ‘alone’ and ‘people’s war’ represented wartime nationalist ideologies, and wrote about them critically. Yet until recently they did not recognise that it was the very particular nature of the histories written in the 1960s which had generated these terms, and which embodied very particular analyses of British history and of the Second World War. The paper ends by arguing that much greater understanding is needed of the core assumptions which lie beneath the historiography of twentieth-century Britain.","[{""name"": ""David Edgerton"", ""affiliation"": [""King’s College London, UK""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We employ a robust methodology to estimate the value of in-kind compensation, and show it to constitute a central part of the labor contract, far exceeding subsistence requirements. Patient admissions records are used to measure nurse productivity, which did not differ across genders. Female compensation varied between 70 percent and 100 percent of male levels, with fluctuations clearly linked to relative labor scarcity. Contrary to common assumptions in the literature, we show that markets played an important role in setting female compensation in early modern Castile. The sources of the gender disparity are, therefore, likely to be found in the broader social and cultural context.","[{""name"": ""Mauricio Drelichman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David González Agudo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00500.x"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2014.08.001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00665.x"", ""10.3886/E117426V2"", ""10.1257/aer.104.4.1091"", ""10.1006/exeh.2001.0775"", ""10.1017/ssh.2019.2"", ""10.1080/13545701.2012.746465"", ""10.19053/978-958-660-293-8"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674332157"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115329"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2012.00663.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818196"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495779"", ""10.1111/1468-0262.00377"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96962-6"", ""10.1017/S0022050715000662"", ""10.2307/2598255"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00642.x"", ""10.1017/S0022050700079195"", ""10.1111/ehr.12491"", ""10.1017/S1361491609002408"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897979"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00054"", ""10.1017/S0212610915000282""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History and Philosophy of Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

These systems shall be formally guaranteed to be trustworthy when applied to safety-critical domains, which is typically achieved by formal verification performed after training. This train-then-verify process has two limits: (i) trained systems are difficult to formally verify due to their continuous and infinite state space and inexplicable AI components (i.e., deep neural networks), and (ii) the ex post facto detection of bugs increases both the time- and money-wise cost of training and deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel verification-in-the-loop training framework called Trainify for developing safe DRL systems driven by counterexample-guided abstraction and refinement. Specifically, Trainify trains a DRL system on a finite set of coarsely abstracted but efficiently verifiable state spaces. When verification fails, we refine the abstraction based on returned counterexamples and train again on the finer abstract states. The process is iterated until all predefined properties are verified against the trained system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on six classic control systems. The experimental results show that our framework yields more reliable DRL systems with provable guarantees without sacrificing system performance such as cumulative reward and robustness than conventional DRL approaches.","[{""name"": ""Peng Jin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jiaxu Tian"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dapeng Zhi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xuejun Wen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Min Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.24963/ijcai.2021/297"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-57628-8_14"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013387"", ""10.1142/S012905410300190X"", ""10.1007/10722167_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8"", ""10.1145/234528.234740"", ""10.1145/3302504.3311807"", ""10.1145/4904.4999"", ""10.1016/S0019-9958(84)80047-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_30"", ""10.1109/JAS.2014.7004690"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.12107"", ""10.1109/DSAA.2018.00018"", ""10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7459105"", ""10.1145/971697.602266"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11694"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_11"", ""10.1007/3-540-58555-9_113"", ""10.1109/87.491203"", ""10.29007/9xgv"", ""10.1145/3341216.3342218"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_47"", ""10.1038/nature14236"", ""10.1109/TCST.2015.2501351"", ""10.1109/TIV.2016.2571067"", ""10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575328"", ""10.1145/3393691.3394176"", ""10.1145/3366703"", ""10.1145/3290354"", ""10.1109/QRS54544.2021.00037"", ""10.1145/3358230"", ""10.1038/s41592-019-0686-2"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2808470"", ""10.1142/S2705078520500150"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_22"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314638""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Europe has numerous historic buildings that need to become more energy-efficient, which need permanent maintenance and refurbishment to fulfill sustainability and use requirements. Asset owners and asset managers need to adopt new strategies to protect listed buildings while optimizing costs and benefits during their life cycle. In this sense, the digital transition proves to be a moment to seize for opening new scenarios. The Digital Twin paradigm promises to be valuable for enabling the sustainable knowledge, conservation, restoration, and management of built assets and solving the dilemma about protecting the architectural identity of these buildings while adapting them to the functional and performance requirements dictated by the regulatory framework. This study proposes a workflow that integrates Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM) and Building Performance Simulation (BPS) tools for data-driving the energy improvement of Italian listed modern buildings built between the 1920s and 1960s. After acquiring information about the building, the HBIM model and the Building Energy Model (BEM) are realized based on the International Foundation Classes (IFC) standard. Energy intervention measures are defined, construction costs are computed, and benefits during the intervention life cycle are predicted in thermal demand. Finally, an expeditious multi-criteria analysis allows for comparing different intervention combinations and indicating the optimal solution for the energy improvement of the building concerning energy, economic, and financial issues. These outcomes represent the first step towards realizing a dynamic, accessible, and sharable Digital Twin.","[{""name"": ""A. Massafra"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G.

As of the crop year 2019/2020, Brazil and Argentina produced 176 million tons which is over half of all world production and these two countries alone will also account for 57 per cent of all Soybeans exported in international trade. How this new agricultural product evolved in these two principal regional producers is the aim of this study. Here we attempt to examine the historical evolution of soybean production in Brazil and Argentina and try to show the unique patterns of production in each of the two crucial states.","[{""name"": ""Herbert S.

Specifically, given a non-termination threshold $$p \in [0, 1],$$ p ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] , we aim for certificates proving that the program terminates with probability at least $$1-p$$ 1 - p . The basic idea of our approach is to find a terminating stochastic invariant, i.e. a subset $$ SI $$ SI of program states such that (i) the probability of the program ever leaving $$ SI $$ SI is no more than p, and (ii) almost-surely, the program either leaves $$ SI $$ SI or terminates.While stochastic invariants are already well-known, we provide the first proof that the idea above is not only sound, but also complete for quantitative termination analysis. We then introduce a novel sound and complete characterization of stochastic invariants that enables template-based approaches for easy synthesis of quantitative termination certificates, especially in affine or polynomial forms. Finally, by combining this idea with the existing martingale-based methods that are relatively complete for qualitative termination analysis, we obtain the first automated, sound, and relatively complete algorithm for quantitative termination analysis. Notably, our completeness guarantees for quantitative termination analysis are as strong as the best-known methods for the qualitative variant.Our prototype implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach on various probabilistic programs. We also demonstrate that our algorithm certifies lower bounds on termination probability for probabilistic programs that are beyond the reach of previous methods.","[{""name"": ""Krishnendu Chatterjee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amir Kafshdar Goharshady"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tobias Meggendorfer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Đorđe Žikelić"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3158122"", ""10.1145/3453483.3454076"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_3"", ""10.1145/2933575.2934554"", ""10.1145/3453483.3454111"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_1"", ""10.1145/3385412.3385969"", ""10.1145/3174800"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-13185-1_4"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-90870-6_33"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009873"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-45069-6_39"", ""10.1515/crll.1902.124.1"", ""10.1016/S0019-9958(84)80039-X"", ""10.1145/800070.802191"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49498-1_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-11245-5_22"", ""10.1038/nature14541"", ""10.1145/3371105"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02768-1_11"", ""10.1145/3360555"", ""10.1145/3208102"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15769-1_24"", ""10.1016/0022-0000(81)90036-2"", ""10.23638/LMCS-16(4:3)2020"", ""10.1007/b138392"", ""10.1145/3158121"", ""10.7717/peerj-cs.103"", ""10.1007/3-540-47764-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72019-3_18"", ""10.1145/3192366.3192394"", ""10.1145/2933575.2935317"", ""10.1512/iumj.1993.42.42045"", ""10.1145/3450967"", ""10.1609/aimag.v21i4.1534"", ""10.1145/3453483.3454102"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314581""]","['Computer Science', 'Mathematics']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Statistics and Probability', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

The construction of new land was a key component of the nation's celebrated rise from 'third world' to 'first world' in the postcolonial period. But the economic benefits of remaking Singapore's coastline came at significant ecological and social costs. Nearly all of the original shore, and its attendant mangrove forests and natural beaches, were lost. So too were two-thirds of Singapore's coral reefs. While carrying out this reclamation, the state also erased a number of sites at which people made a living from the sea, including indigenous communities on the outer islands, age-old fishing villages, kelongs (large, traditional offshore fishing platforms) and prawn farms. The history of land construction in Singapore offers a number of important insights concerning the relationship between humans and our environments. First, it reveals how the tensions between an ideal situation (a city or state's relationship to other places) and a less than optimum site (its physical environment), when combined with a forceful, proactive government, can bring about immense environmental transformations. Related to that, this case sheds light on the ways in which governments - especially in developing nations - can use transformation of terrestrial and marine environments, in the name of progress, as a means of expanding and legitimating their authority. This history also reveals a perhaps unforeseen consequence of bulldozing and burying sites at which humans derived their livelihood from living oceanic resources: the loss of a cultural connection to the sea, based on knowing nature through work. Finally, this history raises the question of how environmental advocates can pursue conservation in a setting like Singapore's shores, which we can no longer consider pristine or natural. That is to say, the ongoing efforts of environmentalists to protect flora and fauna in Singapore's waters speak to the necessity of, and challenges presented by, preserving hybrid (neither entirely natural nor entirely artificial) marine environments.","[{""name"": ""Miles Alexander Powell"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Humanities Nanyang Technological University 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 639798""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This enables precise and efficient reasoning about the state of smart contracts written in Solidity. The formalization is implemented in the SOLC-VERIFY verifier and we provide an extensive set of tests that covers the breadth of the required semantics.

However, quantum noise is a major obstacle to the practical implementation of quantum machine learning. In this work, we define a formal framework for the robustness verification and analysis of quantum machine learning algorithms against noises. A robust bound is derived and an algorithm is developed to check whether or not a quantum machine learning algorithm is robust with respect to quantum training data. In particular, this algorithm can find adversarial examples during checking. Our approach is implemented on Google’s TensorFlow Quantum and can verify the robustness of quantum machine learning algorithms with respect to a small disturbance of noises, derived from the surrounding environment. The effectiveness of our robust bound and algorithm is confirmed by the experimental results, including quantum bits classification as the “Hello World” example, quantum phase recognition and cluster excitation detection from real world intractable physical problems, and the classification of MNIST from the classical world.","[{""name"": ""Ji Guan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wang Fang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mingsheng Ying"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1126/science.aag2302"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976667"", ""10.1038/nature23474"", ""10.1088/1361-6633/aab406"", ""10.1038/s41567-019-0648-8"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.190505"", ""10.1145/2046684.2046692"", ""10.1145/3128572.3140444"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_1"", ""10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033212"", ""10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.023153"", ""10.1103/PhysRevA.101.062331"", ""10.1038/s41534-021-00410-5"", ""10.1016/S0019-9958(67)90302-6"", ""10.1109/CVPRW.2018.00211"", ""10.1038/s41534-020-00339-1"", ""10.1103/PhysRevA.83.053420"", ""10.1109/ICTC49870.2020.9289439"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.200502"", ""10.1103/PhysRevA.81.040302"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_7"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2019/824"", ""10.1109/CDC.2018.8619478"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.1088/1751-8113/41/23/235303""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Computer Science']","['Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7711), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7598)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

We argue for jettisoning this concept’s Huntingtonian baggage, which has led scholarship into a dead end, and developing a new body of theory on a different foundation, one grounded strongly in recent nonprimordial theories of identity and micro-level research into how ordinary people actually understand the civilizational appeals made by their elites. In what we believe to be the first systematic survey-based study of individual-level civilizational identification, we establish proof-of-concept by asking a question: What influences individuals’ primary identification of their own country with particular civilizational alternatives offered up by their elites? Pooling survey data gathered in Russia from 2013–2014, we confirm that civilizational identity reflects the influence of situational considerations and social construction processes. Whether individuals see Russia as part of purported “European,” “Eurasian,” or “Asian” civilizations depends heavily on gendered and nongendered socialization during the USSR period and factors as contingent as perceived economic performance. Results also confirm our expectation that Huntingtonian concepts fit poorly with real-world patterns of civilizational identification.","[{""name"": ""Henry E.

The nutrient delivery to shallow basins supported productivity and, because of O 2 consumption by organic-matter respiration, anoxia development. However, several studies have shown that calcareous nannoplankton experienced a decrease during the T-OAE. Nannofossil fluxes measured in the Llanbedr (Mochras Farm) borehole, Wales, UK, were the highest prior to the negative C-isotope excursion, along with high amounts of taxa indicative of nutrient-rich environments (Biscutaceae). Such conditions attest to high productivity. Fluxes show the lowest values in the core of the event, along with a size decrease of Schizosphaerella and a peak in Calyculaceae. The recovery of nannofossil fluxes and Schizosphaerella size occurred concomitant with the return of C-isotopes to more positive values. Concomitantly, deep dwellers ( Crepidolithus crassus ) dominated, indicating a recovery of the photic-zone productivity. These observations demonstrate that the cascade of environmental responses to the initial perturbation was more complex than previously considered. In spite of elevated nutrient delivery to epicontinental basins in the early Toarcian, carbonate and primary productions of nannoplankton were depressed in the core the T-OAE, probably because of prolonged thermohaline seawater stratification.","[{""name"": ""Alessandro Menini"", ""affiliation"": [""Université de Lyon, UCBL, ENSL, UJM, CNRS, LGL-TPE, F-69622, Villeurbanne, France""]}, {""name"": ""Emanuela Mattioli"", ""affiliation"": [""Université de Lyon, UCBL, ENSL, UJM, CNRS, LGL-TPE, F-69622, Villeurbanne, France"", ""Institut Universitaire de France""]}, {""name"": ""Stephen P.

Thus, we have the conceptualization of intellectual imperialism, academic dependency, academic extractivism and academic capitalism. This essay focuses on two of these phenomenon, that is, intellectual imperialism and academic dependency, suggesting that they refer to different, yet related, problems in global knowledge production. While intellectual imperialism is a crucial starting point for the understanding of knowledge production in the Third World/Periphery/South, it interacts with academic dependency to maintain the underdevelopment of academia in many communities worldwide.","[{""name"": ""Syed Farid Alatas"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology National University of Singapore  Singapore Singapore"", ""Department of Anthropology &amp; Sociology University of Malaya  Kuala Lumpur Malaysia""]}]","[""10.1177/00113921030516003"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-41134-1"", ""10.1163/030382400X00154"", ""10.1177/0011392106058831"", ""10.17763/haer.45.2.f2p87v8h618322m2"", ""10.1177/016146817707900201"", ""10.1080/19460171.2017.1403342""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/pastj/gtz054,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,ON THE TRANSNATIONAL DESTRUCTION OF CITIES: WHAT JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES LEARNED FROM THE BOMBING OF BRITAIN AND GERMANY IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR,"Abstract How did it become ‘normal’ to bomb civilians? Focusing on the aerial bombardment of China, Germany, Britain, and Japan in 1937-45, this essay spotlights the role of transnational learning in the construction and destruction of ‘home fronts’. Belligerents vigorously studied each other's strategies to destroy the enemy's cities and ‘morale’, while investigating efforts to defend one's own home front by means of ‘civilian defence’. The inclusion of Japan, as bomber and bombed, contributes to a more global, connected history of the Second World War. Japan's sustained bombardment of Chinese cities not only reflected emerging transnational ideas of strategic bombing and total war, but also imparted new ‘lessons’ to Western air forces. Moreover, the devastating US firebombing of Japanese cities in 1945 challenges widely accepted judgments that bombing was generally ineffective, serving only to stiffen civilian morale. Why Japanese cities were bombed, and how they were bombed, was not an exceptional story, but was intimately connected to what the Allies had learned from bombing European urban areas.","[{""name"": ""Sheldon Garon"", ""affiliation"": [""Princeton University""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/nana.12689,NATIONS AND NATIONALISM,0603 World History; 0304 Ethnology; 0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,National identity and populism: The relationship between conceptions of nationhood and populist attitudes,"AbstractConventional wisdom argues that national identity and populism go hand in hand. We disentangle this relationship by examining how populist attitudes relate to two distinct conceptions of nationhood: civic and ethnic national identity. We argue that a civic conception of nationhood is negatively related to populism, while an ethnic conception of nationhood is positively related. Additionally, we expect these relationships to be moderated by socio‐economic status. Using data from the German Longitudinal Election Study from 2017, our analyses show that, on average, both civic and ethnic conceptions of nationhood relate positively to populist attitudes. This finding, however, changes substantially once we account for socio‐economic status: For respondents with higher levels of education and/or a more positive evaluation of the state of the economy, the relationship between civic national identity and populism turns negative, which is more in line with our expectations. We find no moderation for an ethnic national identity.","[{""name"": ""Maximilian Filsinger"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science University of Bern  Bern Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Steffen Wamsler"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science University of Bern  Bern Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Julian Erhardt"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science University of Bern  Bern Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Markus Freitag"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science University of Bern  Bern Switzerland""]}]","[""10.1177/0003122420905127"", ""10.1177/0010414013512600"", ""10.1111/spsr.12275"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00532.x"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1004230"", ""10.1080/15705854.2010.524403"", ""10.1111/spsr.12326"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00329"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-081715-074412"", ""10.4159/9780674028944"", ""10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7"", ""10.1177/1065912919833176"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00330"", ""10.1093/pan/mpn014"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1550152"", ""10.5964/jspp.v7i1.557"", ""10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02029.x"", ""10.1111/spsr.12049"", ""10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02030.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7snkj.10"", ""10.1177/0020715218810331"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990372"", ""10.1111/ajps.12138"", ""10.4324/9781315196923"", ""10.1111/spsr.12281"", ""10.4324/9781315196923-1"", ""10.1111/nana.12235"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2010.05.005"", ""10.1177/1368430208101058"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.1177/000312240907400404"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141107"", ""10.1111/nana.12345"", ""10.1080/00344893.2019.1643772"", ""10.1111/nana.12517"", ""10.1177/0090591700028001003"", ""10.1017/S0007123411000251"", ""10.1177/1354068819868908"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2010.00446.x"", ""10.1057/s41269-017-0068-7"", ""10.1177/0267323117737952"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00050.x"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00140"", ""10.1177/0020715218816242"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090194"", ""10.1177/0010414002035005003"", ""10.4324/9780203167960"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edk007"", ""10.1177/1065912916639138"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-022018-024059"", ""10.1177/0263395719859306"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12216"", ""10.1080/00224545.2016.1184125"", ""10.1086/522803"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00843.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00885.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000807"", ""10.1111/1469-8219.00081""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Following social anthropologists Gingrich and Banks, the term neonationalism will be applied and linked with the concept “mythomoteur” of John Armstrong and Anthony D. Smith, emphasizing the role of preexisting ethno-symbolic resources or mythomoteurs in the resurgence of nationalism. Special attention will be given to elites who play a major role in constructing new discourses of the nation and seek to control collective memories, taking their diverse intentions, agendas, and strategies specifically into consideration. This “view from above” will be complemented with a “view from below” by investigating the meanings that audiences give to and the uses they make of these memories. Thus, the analysis has three dimensions: it starts with the analysis of symbols, topics, and arguments applied by public Trianon discourses; it continues with the analysis of everyday perceptions, memory, and identity concerns; and finally ends with an anthropological interpretation of memory politics regarding a new form of nationalism arising in the context of propelling and mainstreaming populist right-wing politics. The main argument of this article is that although the Hungarian Trianon cult, identified as national mythomoteur, invokes a historical trauma, it rather speaks to current feelings of loss and disenfranchisement, offering symbolic compensation through the transference of historical glory, pride, and self-esteem within a mythological framework. This article is part of a larger effort to understand the cultural logic and social support of new forms of nationalism in Hungary propelled by the populist far right.","[{""name"": ""Margit Feischmidt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3167/9780857452030"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226993058.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1469-8676.12420"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00491.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198295341.003.0011"", ""10.1007/s11133-010-9184-7"", ""10.1017/S0010417502000336"", ""10.1177/1468796808088925"", ""10.2307/j.ctt9qd8t4"", ""10.1080/09637499008431450"", ""10.3167/9781845451899"", ""10.1017/S0010417517000202"", ""10.1111/nana.12264"", ""10.1525/ae.1991.18.3.02a00020"", ""10.1515/9786155225468-005"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.105""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

This kind of constituent mechanism had previously been resisted by the traditional political parties, most of whom now support the mechanism. This article identifies the political groups who opposed a Constituent Assembly and argues that the shift in approach was due to three factors. First, there had been a cumulative process of social pressure and political reactions since 2006. Second, the social unrest of October 2019 raised costs for the political elite – right and left – of denying a Constituent Assembly. Third, the establishment was able to reduce the uncertainty of the constitution‐making process.","[{""name"": ""Maria Cristina Escudero"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad de Chile  Chile""]}]","[""10.1007/s10978-020-09260-0"", ""10.1177/095169280101300301"", ""10.1108/S0163-786X20160000039008"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000222"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817595"", ""10.2307/1372906"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2007.tb00386.x"", ""10.4337/9781785365263.00035"", ""10.31752/idea.2018.10"", ""10.2307/2586011"", ""10.1215/9780822390589""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The princely states were ruled by indigenous rulers and were not considered to be British territory, but remained subject to British “influence;” as a result, there were numerous controversies over their legal status. During the course of jurisdictional disputes, a variety of interested players - British politicians, colonial officials, international lawyers, rulers and advisors of princely states - engaged in debates over the idea of sovereignty to resolve questions of legal status, the extent of rights and powers, and to construct a political order that supported their interests and aspirations. I focus on legal texts written by British international lawyers and colonial officials as well as material relating to two jurisdictional disputes (one between the state of Travancore and the British Government and another between the state of Baroda and the British Government) to trace two versions of sovereignty that were articulated in late nineteenth century South Asia - unitary and divisible. In doing so, I argue that international law, and the doctrine of sovereignty in particular, became the shared language for participants to debate political problems and a key forum for the negotiation of political power.","[{""name"": ""Priyasha Saksena"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511973574"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511494277"", ""10.1177/001946460804600101"", ""10.1111/j.1747-4469.2007.00087.x"", ""10.4159/9780674972780"", ""10.1353/imp.2018.0060"", ""10.1093/he/9780198737445.003.0004"", ""10.3917/mond1.151.0095"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316118665.008"", ""10.1093/bybil/75.1.9"", ""10.1017/S0922156599000023"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139015424"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674067356"", ""10.2307/3102572"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511583292"", ""10.1525/9780520933330"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511730252"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139096744.015"", ""10.1515/9780691207223"", ""10.2307/2547846"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511494222.003"", ""10.1515/9781400835072"", ""10.1353/imp.2018.0059"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719079092.003.0003"", ""10.1017/S073824801000074X"", ""10.1017/S0026749X17000257"", ""10.2307/3053874"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190648664.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0026749X17000981"", ""10.1093/lril/lrt005"", ""10.1017/S0018246X14000259"", ""10.7312/chen17374"", ""10.1017/S0738248000002583"", ""10.1016/j.jhg.2015.06.015"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511614262"", ""10.1017/9781316414880"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490439"", ""10.4159/9780674986275"", ""10.1016/j.jhg.2013.03.002"", ""10.1017/S0738248016000195"", ""10.1163/15718050-12340100"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198766070.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400876648"", ""10.1017/S0738248015000115"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004154810.i-255.20"", ""10.1017/S0026749X12000728"", ""10.1163/9789004644793"", ""10.1017/S084182090000360X"", ""10.1515/9781400842605"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199792054.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230289604"", ""10.1215/1089201X-2826037""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

Its main argument is that, contrary to wide held assumptions in the historiography, what characterized Late Antiquity was not simply the exacerbation of violence or its tighter control, but the crisis of aristocratic hegemony and the expansion of opportunities for popular intervention in city life. What has been perceived as the product fanaticism, irrationality and deprivation of the masses, of the manipulation of bishops and aristocrats or of the failure of the mechanisms of coercion was actually the result of a dramatic social change that, on the one hand, involved a new dynamic of power and, on the other, a shift in the way the people understood their role and power in local communities.","[{""name"": ""Julio Cesar Magalhães de Oliveira"", ""affiliation"": [""University of São Paulo""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Anthropology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

We assess what topics in particular lend themselves to a fresh perspective focusing on Irish nationalism, while also indicating areas where there is considerable scope for new lines of inquiry. In this era of intensive commemoration of the events that unfolded between 1912 and 1923, this special issue serves to remind us that the history of the revolution should not be confined to the island of Ireland. We argue that thinking transnationally and comparatively can promote a more inclusive and diverse global history of Irish Revolution.","[{""name"": ""Enda Delaney"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fearghal McGarry"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198745129.001.0001"", ""10.1086/ahr.111.5.1441"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-59637-6"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199583713.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400874064"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195331776.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818462"", ""10.1080/19475020.2019.1590218"", ""10.14361/9783839427347"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199654918.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/ehr.12971,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Infant and child mortality by socio-economic status in early nineteenth-century England †,"AbstractHistorical relationships between socio‐economic status and mortality remain poorly understood. This is particularly the case in England, due to a lack of status indicators in available sources especially beforec. 1850. This study uses the paternal occupational descriptors routinely recorded in Anglican baptism registers from 1813–37 to compare infant and early childhood mortality by social status. The sample consists of eight of the Cambridge Group family reconstitution parishes, which make it possible to investigate the contributions of environment as well as household characteristics. The main variable of interest was an individual‐level continuous measure of wealth based on ranking paternal occupations by the propensity for their movable wealth to be inventoried upon death. The findings show that wealth conferred no clear survival advantage in infancy, once differences in average mortality levels between parishes were adjusted for. However, wealth was associated with higher survival rates in early childhood, especially in the second year of life, and this pattern persisted after adjustment for parish‐level effects. The striking exception to this pattern was labourers, who were among the poorest of fathers but whose children enjoyed relatively low mortality. Thus socio‐economic differentials in mortality were present in early nineteenth‐century England; however, they were small, age‐specific, and non‐linear.","[{""name"": ""Hannaliis Jaadla"", ""affiliation"": [""Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure University of Cambridge , and Estonian Institute for Population Studies Tallinn University""]}, {""name"": ""Ellen Potter"", ""affiliation"": [""Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure University of Cambridge""]}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Keibek"", ""affiliation"": [""Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure University of Cambridge""]}, {""name"": ""Romola Davenport"", ""affiliation"": [""Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure University of Cambridge""]}]","[""10.2307/3348839"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4227.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01615440903270299"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2011.05.005"", ""10.1017/S136149161100013X"", ""10.1007/s13524-017-0556-4"", ""10.1007/s13524-019-00786-2"", ""10.1016/0277-9536(88)90201-8"", ""10.1007/s13524-016-0495-5"", ""10.1080/24694452.2016.1261682"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2019.1580601"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2011.05.007"", ""10.1002/psp.2232"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511735325"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511975912"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61257-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495816"", ""10.2307/1531814"", ""10.4054/DemRes.2017.37.58"", ""10.1002/9781118504338.ch10"", ""10.2307/2060586"", ""10.1017/S002572730004686X"", ""10.1080/01615440.2012.715569"", ""10.1080/0032472031000142536"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511661617.008"", ""10.1016/S1081-602X(02)00127-6"", ""10.2307/2626958"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.02.031"", ""10.1056/NEJMsa0707519"", ""10.2307/2807954"", ""10.1093/shm/hkq042"", ""10.1128/CDLI.6.6.868-871.1999"", ""10.1080/0032472031000141256"", ""10.1177/0022146510383498"", ""10.1179/174963207X227578"", ""10.1093/past/131.1.89"", ""10.1163/9789004638679_010"", ""10.4054/DemRes.2018.39.18"", ""10.1016/0014-4983(73)90026-0"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2011.05.011"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00585.x"", ""10.1016/j.hisfam.2008.08.001"", ""10.18356/85946e24-en"", ""10.1177/002214650704800401"", ""10.1093/shm/5.1.71"", ""10.1080/0032472031000146976"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496127"", ""10.1080/0032472031000143516"", ""10.1017/S0268416000002514"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511660344""]","['Environmental Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Health', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

In this article, I present evidence for the medical use of incense in the Carolingian world. Using a sample of eighth‐ and ninth‐century manuscripts, I analyse incense recipes, investigating their contexts and ingredients, as well as the use of incense itself as an ingredient in medical remedies. This evidence not only suggests that incense was understood as a multipurpose substance, but also offers a new window into exploring early medieval medical knowledge and practice and relates to the sacralization of medicine in this period.","[{""name"": ""Claire Burridge"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Cambridge""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Classics', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6825), ('0602 中国史', 0.6817)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

Our analysis of Swiss parliamentary debates on this legislative proposal between 2005 and 2011 shows that Swiss MPs came to depict female circumcision as a threat to the Swiss nation but portrayed genital cosmetic surgery carried out in Swiss clinics as a signifier of “Swissness.” The Swiss debates over women's genital modifications produced an unusually high level of political unanimity between pro‐feminist left‐wing MPs and anti‐feminist conservative and populist MPs, all of whom claimed to defend women's rights. In this process, MPs formulated criteria for membership and non‐membership of the Swiss nation which, we argue, reflect wider political dynamics, best understood through the lens of femonationalism.","[{""name"": ""Dina Bader"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology New York University  New York""]}, {""name"": ""Véronique Mottier"", ""affiliation"": [""Jesus College  Cambridge UK"", ""Centre en Etudes Genre University of Lausanne  Lausanne Switzerland""]}]","[""10.1525/aa.2002.104.3.783"", ""10.1111/nana.12329"", ""10.1515/sjs-2016-0025"", ""10.1080/14680777.2018.1560348"", ""10.1016/S0968-8080(10)35506-6"", ""10.1177/1350506811435032"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00520.x"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2010.00453.x"", ""10.1177/1350506809350857"", ""10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02029.x"", ""10.1215/9780822372929"", ""10.3917/mult.026.0123"", ""10.1080/14616660500200223"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00519.x"", ""10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2015.10.012"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790676"", ""10.1057/9781137442741_13"", ""10.1177/0038038510375740"", ""10.1080/13688790.2015.1191987"", ""10.1787/9789264307216-en"", ""10.1057/9781137442741"", ""10.1111/j.1354-5078.2005.00199.x"", ""10.1080/014198798329784"", ""10.1055/s-0041-111171"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490415""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1108/HESWBL-10-2022-0213,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,Entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial intention among higher education students in Vietnam: do entrepreneurial self-efficacy and family support matter?,"PurposeThe current study aims to explain the relationship between entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial intention through a moderated mediation model from the lens of social cognitive career theory (SCCT). Specifically, two main objectives of this study are (1) to explore the mediation role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy in the relationship between entrepreneurial education and start-up intention and (2) to investigate the moderate role of family support on the effect of entrepreneurial education on entrepreneurial intention.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a sample of 1879 students in Vietnam and SPSS PROCESS macro developed by Hayes (2012) to examine the indirect effect of entrepreneurial education on start-up intention via entrepreneurial self-efficacy and the moderated mediation effect of family support.FindingsThis study reveals that the association between entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial intention is partially mediated via entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Also, the effect of entrepreneurial education on entrepreneurial self-efficacy and start-up intention was negatively moderated by family support. Furthermore, the indirect effect of entrepreneurial education on intention to form a venture via entrepreneurial self-efficacy is also negatively moderated by family support.Originality/valueThe entrepreneurial education and start-up intention linkage remain a significant gap in the entrepreneurship literature. Therefore, this research study is expected to contribute to clarifying this linkage by utilizing the SCCT to explain how entrepreneurial education contributes to entrepreneurial intention.","[{""name"": ""Hong Hai Pham"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thi Loan Le"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijme.2019.100327"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1111/etap.12095"", ""10.1521/jscp.1986.4.3.359"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90022-L"", ""10.1111/1467-8624.00273"", ""10.15678/EBER.2021.090102"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2020.100450"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2010.11.009"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2022.100639"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2019.04.001"", ""10.1080/08276331.1991.10600389"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2021.106107"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-01-2022-0006"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2016.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.11.024"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.5465/amle.2012.0107"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2017.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2019.01.002"", ""10.1108/ET-05-2020-0142"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2018.08.004"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2014.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2019.03.007"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2018.01.008"", ""10.1108/APJIE-04-2017-018"", ""10.1177/104225879401800307"", ""10.1108/13552551211268148"", ""10.1177/104225879201700105"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2019.06.004"", ""10.1006/jvbe.1994.1027"", ""10.1007/s11365-008-0093-0"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2009.00318.x"", ""10.15678/EBER.2021.090301"", ""10.1108/ET-02-2021-0074"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2021.100553"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2021.100545"", ""10.5465/amr.2006.19379628"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2019.105982"", ""10.1016/j.iedeen.2021.100152"", ""10.1108/MD-07-2014-0464"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.11.005"", ""10.1177/014920638601200408"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.1080/00273170701341316"", ""10.1007/BF00898416"", ""10.1108/13552550510580834"", ""10.1108/IJEBR-12-2017-0522"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2016.05.027"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2021.100560"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2015.10.003"", ""10.1080/08985626.2012.721009"", ""10.1108/14626000810917843"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.90.6.1265""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Education']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

It demonstrates that the climatic fluctuations characterizing these environmental crises were synchronized with global climatic oscillations, specifically the El Niño Southern Oscillation. Recurrent episodes of severe drought and cold dramatically affected these groups, who were unable to withstand extreme changes in temperature and precipitation. Back-to-back drought episodes created a shortage of water, dried up pastures and damaged forage, while severe cold resulted in high rates of premature death among herd animals. These climatic events thus had devastating economic and social consequences.","[{""name"": ""Zozan Pehlivan"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Minnesota Twin Cities""]}]",[],"['Environmental Science', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Atmospheric Science', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Anthropology']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0706 大气科学', 0.7502), ('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7343)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The case of retail Islamic banks of Bahrain,"PurposeManagers claim that fresh graduates are unequipped to meet market demands. The aim of this study is to investigate the perception of employers in retail Islamic banks of Bahrain on newly graduated business students. The Singaporean Model of Employability Skills was implemented, to ascertain the mean ratings of employability skills in terms of their importance and the competency of business graduates.Design/methodology/approachThis deductive research approach initiated with a literature review that identifies research gap and a model that was tested via a self-administration adopted survey by collected data from 220 senior employees at retail Islamic banks of BahrainFindingsThe systematic of convenience sampling technique was used in selecting 161 samples and the researcher received only 85 completed questionnaire forms. Findings initiate that employers appreciated the importance of teamwork, risk management and decision-making skills. Their main recommendation was that employers should establish a durable bond with universities to enhance employability skills.Originality/valueBecause the researcher gathered all data from employers of different Islamic banks in Bahrain, this sector in addition will get the advantage of the results that banks will formulate their strategic plans accordingly to tackle the business graduates’ weaknesses. Likewise, universities and researchers might be motivated to look into new innovative methods that assist graduates to accommodate with market conditions.","[{""name"": ""Noor Al-Shehab"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mukhtar AL-Hashimi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Araby Madbouly"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sameh Reyad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Allam Hamdan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/ET-08-2017-0120"", ""10.1177/0143831X06063098"", ""10.1108/LODJ-07-2018-0281"", ""10.1080/03098265.2014.911826"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2005.11.010"", ""10.1108/00400910910964575"", ""10.1108/ET-07-2012-0077"", ""10.1080/13596740200200132"", ""10.1080/10668926.2014.981888"", ""10.1080/13639080.2012.718750"", ""10.1037/a0025741"", ""10.1080/08832323.2016.1153998"", ""10.1080/13538320120060015"", ""10.4236/jhrss.2016.41005"", ""10.1177/0273475317712766"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-04-2018-0049"", ""10.1080/13583883.2015.1114139"", ""10.1108/00400910710754435"", ""10.5032/jae.2008.04096"", ""10.1080/03075079.2011.604408"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.1989.tb01581.x"", ""10.1080/10963758.2015.1089510""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Education', 'Media Technology']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"

We draw on original interviews with diasporic youth in France, the United Kingdom, and Russia—diasporas that were largely built in the aftermath of the genocide and the Karabakh war. Diaspora youth relate to these events through transmitted collective memories, but also reconnect with the distant homeland’s past and present in new ways as they engage with new possibilities of transnational digital communication and mobility. Their experiences of identity shed light on how the new generation of diasporic Armenians defines itself in relation to the past; how this past is (re)made present in their interpretations of the Karabakh conflict and in everyday behaviors; and how diasporic youth experience the dilemmas of “moving on” from traumatic narratives that for a long time have been seen as foundational to their identity.","[{""name"": ""Dmitry Chernobrov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leila Wilmers"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1468796819866973"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2017.1313104"", ""10.1111/pops.12433"", ""10.4324/9780203553336"", ""10.1111/glob.12150"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2017.1354159"", ""10.1080/014198700329105"", ""10.1111/j.1754-9469.2010.01079.x"", ""10.1080/00905992.2013.767227"", ""10.1177/1354066112445290"", ""10.16997/wpcc.203"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2017.1354152"", ""10.1017/S0260210510001737"", ""10.1111/imig.12183"", ""10.1111/j.1749-8198.2007.00033.x"", ""10.1080/13645570701401305"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511489402"", ""10.1080/14746689.2013.820483"", ""10.1080/01419870.2012.674542"", ""10.1177/146144804044327"", ""10.1080/00905992.2017.1347917"", ""10.1525/pol.1999.22.2.80"", ""10.1080/714000931"", ""10.1215/08992363-14-2-411"", ""10.1080/0141987042000289997"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2017.01.002""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

First, verifier developers must contend with the rapidly changing DNN field to support new DNN operations and property types. Second, verifier users have the burden of selecting a verifier input format to specify their problem. Due to the many input formats, this decision can greatly restrict the verifiers that a user may run. Finally, researchers face difficulties in re-using benchmarks to evaluate and compare verifiers, due to the large number of input formats required to run different verifiers. Existing benchmarks are rarely in formats supported by verifiers other than the one for which the benchmark was introduced. In this work we present DNNV, a framework for reducing the burden on DNN verifier researchers, developers, and users. DNNV standardizes input and output formats, includes a simple yet expressive DSL for specifying DNN properties, and provides powerful simplification and reduction operations to facilitate the application, development, and comparison of DNN verifiers. We show how DNNV increases the support of verifiers for existing benchmarks from 30% to 74%.","[{""name"": ""David Shriver"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Elbaum"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthew B.

Degree Apprenticeships aid public-sector recruitment, support progression routes and social mobility within the existing workforce, and contribute to recruitment and productivity in public services and economically critical industries. Practices in the organisation and delivery of apprenticeships are variable, but a clear need is illustrated for strong institution–employer partnerships, integration between on- and off-the-job learning, expansive workplace learning environments, and co-ordination of assessment and quality assurance. There is also a need for external bodies to provide a consistent policy and funding environment.Practical implicationsThe findings illustrate the need for strong partnerships, for programmes that are designed from the ground up as apprenticeships, and for effective integration of apprentices into the organisation's working environment.Originality/valueThis study updates and adds to the literature on DAs and work-integrated higher education. It emphasises three aspects that have hitherto been given little attention: the value of DAs for public-sector recruitment and for creating social mobility within the existing workforce, and the importance of ensuring apprenticeships are aligned with organisational objectives.","[{""name"": ""Stan Lester"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/HESWBL-01-2018-0006"", ""10.1080/01425699995380"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-6977-0.ch003"", ""10.1108/ET-10-2015-0091"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-8856-8.ch008"", ""10.1080/02602930600848267"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-05-2019-123"", ""10.1080/0309877X.2012.699516"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-10-2018-0106"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-10-2018-0113"", ""10.1108/20423891111128890"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-10-2018-0099"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-10-2018-0108"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-06-2016-0042"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-02-2019-0024""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

We consider a forward-mode AD method on a higher order language with algebraic data types, and we characterise it as the unique structure preserving macro given a choice of derivatives for basic operations. We describe a rich semantics for differentiable programming, based on diffeological spaces. We show that it interprets our language, and we phrase what it means for the AD method to be correct with respect to this semantics. We show that our characterisation of AD gives rise to an elegant semantic proof of its correctness based on a gluing construction on diffeological spaces. We explain how this is, in essence, a logical relations argument. Finally, we sketch how the analysis extends to other AD methods by considering a continuation-based method.","[{""name"": ""Mathieu Huot"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sam Staton"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthijs Vákár"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3371106"", ""10.1090/S0002-9947-2011-05107-X"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-44914-8_3"", ""10.1145/3371132"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(03)00392-X"", ""10.1145/3236765"", ""10.1109/LICS.2019.8785665"", ""10.1090/surv/185"", ""10.1214/aoms/1177729392"", ""10.1007/BF01589116"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2012.08.017"", ""10.1007/3-540-56992-8_21"", ""10.1201/b10905-6"", ""10.1145/1330017.1330018"", ""10.1016/S0893-6080(98)00116-6"", ""10.1214/aoms/1177729586"", ""10.1145/3341701"", ""10.1007/BFb0089728"", ""10.1145/3341700""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

It also tells the story of an important moment of race-making in the years after the Second World War. Though Kenya may be considered a frontier market for today's biometrics industry, fingerprinting was first introduced in the early twentieth century. By 1920, the Kenyan colonial government had dictated that African men who left their reserves be fingerprinted and issued an identity card (known colloquially as akipande). In the late 1940s, after decades of African protest, the colonial government replaced thekipandewith a universal system of registration via fingerprinting. This legislative move was accompanied by protests from members of the white settler community. Ironically, the effort to deracialize Kenya's identification regime only further normalized the use of biometrics, but also failed to fully undermine associations between white male exceptionalism and exemption from fingerprinting.","[{""name"": ""KEREN WEITZBERG"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctvjz80ss"", ""10.1057/9780230392960"", ""10.1525/california/9780520290495.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0001972010000070"", ""10.1017/S0010417506000338"", ""10.2307/j.ctv14gpj6p"", ""10.1017/asr.2016.36"", ""10.5871/bacad/9780197265314.001.0001"", ""10.1017/asr.2016.39"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139939546"", ""10.5040/9781350219656"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbp026"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a097774"", ""10.1080/03057078608708131"", ""10.1080/13621025.2014.865892"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511584091"", ""10.13109/gege.2016.42.1.60"", ""10.1093/ahr/119.1.78"", ""10.1017/S002185370000774X"", ""10.2307/j.ctv224txv2"", ""10.1525/california/9780520272149.001.0001"", ""10.2307/525576"", ""10.1215/08992363-1161940"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-17960-2"", ""10.1215/9780822394822"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1pwt9w5"", ""10.4324/9781315692593"", ""10.1080/01419870903428505""]","['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Social Sciences']","['Genetics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.733), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7315)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Such a post-Eurocentric perspective is necessary to both generate a fair comparative module that centralizes the emic (culture-specific) features of a language and to avoid Eurocentric misrepresentation of the non-European culture under consideration. This paper challenges the common academic position that Eurocentric traditions are foundational to understanding ancient Egyptian and Arabic literary systems.

Today’s lexicographers must accept that their product par excellence is not dictionaries, but lexicographical data that can either be presented to the users in the form of dictionaries or be integrated into various types of tools, platforms, and services. From this perspective, the paper describes the functionalities of various digital writing assistants and focuses on one of them, namely the Spanish-English Write Assistant. It illustrates some decisions that have to be taken to prepare a database to feed both this tool and a series of online dictionaries. A proposal on how a big amount of lexicographical data can be presented in a small pop-up window without resorting to data overload will be discussed. In this connection, alternative ways of doing user testing in a digital environment are introduced. Finally, the paper stresses the importance of a human-centered design and terminology.","[{""name"": ""Pedro A.

The following source controls of the rock system are considered: (1) initial magnesium and iron content; (2) initial sodium and calcium content; (3) pressure–temperature path followed by the system; and (4) threshold by which melt extractions in the system are triggered. These source controls are investigated in a water-restricted system and a water-in-excess system. The permutation of these cases resulted in 128 different modelled pressure–temperature bulk composition paths investigating the melting of an average pelite composition. The resultant melt compositions are compared to that of a natural granite dataset and provide a good fit for the incompatible elements Na 2 O and K 2 O with the allowance that granites most likely form as magmas consisting of melt and ferromagnesian-rich crystals. The fluid state of the system is shown to have the strongest control on melt compositions, with the pressure–temperature path having subordinate control on the volume and composition of melts produced.","[{""name"": ""Matthew J.

To analyze their relations simply in terms of decolonial Indigenous knowledge would be a culturally imperialist act from the Americas: decoloniality is specific to the development of racialization in the West via white settler colonialism, antiblack enslavement, and anti‐Indigenous exploitation and genocide. Instead, this article draws from southern African historical sources and Southeast Asian ethnographic sources to advocate a historiography and ethnography of vernaculars, both vernacular knowledge and vernacular ignorance, in order to avoid autochthonous and potentially xenophobic claims.","[{""name"": ""JUNO SALAZAR PARREÑAS"", ""affiliation"": [""Cornell University""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Irradiated samples were step-heated in an ultra-high-vacuum resistance furnace attached to a mass spectrometer, thus also allowing 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology. Conjoint inversion of these datasets allowed estimation of the relevant diffusion parameters, which were then used to forward model the effect of arbitrary temperature–time histories. Simulations used Monte Carlo methods to improve approximations to the observed age spectra. Two periods of rapid cooling could be inferred. The South Cyclades Shear Zone commenced operation during or shortly after the Eocene–Oligocene transition. Episodes of south-directed movement continued into Early Miocene time, however, with the footwall still hot enough to cause biotite ± garnet metamorphic mineral growth at the base of the overlying, already substantially exhumed, eclogite–blueschist unit. Since its footwall continued to cool, the South Cyclades Shear Zone was an extensional shear zone during both episodes of its operation.","[{""name"": ""Marnie Forster"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oleg Koudashev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ruoran Nie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sonia Yeung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gordon Lister"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s00531-015-1255-2"", ""10.1002/2014TC003664"", ""10.1016/0191-8141(93)90006-V"", ""10.1029/97TC02003"", ""10.1029/97JB03106"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2008.02.038"", ""10.1139/cjes-2015-0203"", ""10.1016/0191-8141(91)90027-G"", ""10.1017/S0016756806002585"", ""10.1111/jmg.12228"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1986)14<7:SEOTWA>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1983)11<342:SMFTOO>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1016/0191-8141(87)90053-8"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2015.04.007"", ""10.1144/SP311.6"", ""10.1016/0024-4937(90)90003-J"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.1999.154.01.14"", ""10.1016/j.jsg.2003.10.004"", ""10.1007/s00410-005-0032-9"", ""10.1144/0016-76492007-016"", ""10.1029/2007JB005382"", ""10.1144/SP332.2"", ""10.1080/08120099.2015.1114524"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(94)90066-3"", ""10.1029/93TC01131"", ""10.1130/L164.1"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2008.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.pnsc.2008.01.016"", ""10.1016/j.gca.2008.09.038"", ""10.1016/j.jsg.2018.12.008"", ""10.1029/2008TC002397"", ""10.1017/S0016756814000661"", ""10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04372.x"", ""10.1007/s00531-008-0366-4"", ""10.1029/2000TC900018"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027<0067:OMBKEG>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.2475/ajs.303.5.353"", ""10.1130/0-8137-2380-9.185"", ""10.1130/0-8137-2380-9.185"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2009.10.032"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2012.06.011"", ""10.1130/0-8137-2409-0.97"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2016.12.013"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020<0121:LMDEAD>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1016/j.jsg.2004.02.013"", ""10.1016/0191-8141(89)90036-9"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2008.10.024"", ""10.1111/jmg.12178"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1984)12<221:MCCOCT>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.2001.184.01.06"", ""10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00147-6"", ""10.1016/S0016-7037(01)00846-8"", ""10.1016/0025-3227(90)90060-W"", ""10.1144/gsjgs.156.2.0261"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.1999.154.01.05"", ""10.1146/annurev.earth.34.031405.125202"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1990)018<0216:FOMZIC>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1146/annurev.earth.050708.170910"", ""10.1144/0016-76492010-064"", ""10.1016/j.jog.2016.03.008"", ""10.3809/jvirtex.2007.00181"", ""10.1007/BF00371243"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1314.2003.00482.x"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2011.02.005"", ""10.1111/ter.12357"", ""10.1144/SP321.7"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.1990.054.01.47"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2017.12.031"", ""10.1016/S0191-8141(96)00068-5"", ""10.1130/B26102.1"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2117.1988.tb00001.x"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(98)00182-6"", ""10.1029/2011TC002946""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],"['Atmospheric Science', 'Geophysics']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0706 大气科学', 0.7502), ('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7343)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"

This article explores why these conclusions took hold; the European deification of animal protein in previous centuries; structural changes to African diets and food economies under colonial government; and the political value of such a consensus. Unlike elsewhere in the world, where deficiency was removed from the exceptionalism of tropical medicine, protein malnutrition was constructed as a particularly African concern. Focusing this discussion on the history of the severe childhood deficiency, kwashiorkor, this article explores how the politically informed othering of African nutrition came to direct, or misdirect, the medicine of malnutrition in twentieth-century Africa.","[{""name"": ""John Nott"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASoS), Maastricht University, Grote Gracht 90-92, 6211 SZ Maastricht, The Netherlands""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'History', 'Anthropology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The selection of a suitable strategy is from a pre-defined set of strategies and by taking into account the syntax and semantics of the code to be verified. This year we present VeriAbs version 1.4.1 in which a novel preprocessor to strategy selection is introduced. The preprocessor checks for the feasibility of performing a lightweight slicing of the input code using function call graph and variable reference information. By this if the program is found to besliceable, sub-programs or slices are generated, and the known strategy selection algorithm of VeriAbs is applied to each slice. The verification results of each slice are then composed to derive that of the entire program. This compositional verification has improved the scalability of VeriAbs and presented in this paper.","[{""name"": ""Priyanka Darke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sakshi Agrawal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R.

10.1017/S1740022819000354,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY,0603 World History,"The globalization of hybrid maize, 1921-70","AbstractWell before the green revolution in the 1960s, hybrid maize technology that had originally been developed in the USA spread across the world, starting before the Second World War. This article uses a framework that analyses the type of transfer (materials, knowledge, or capacity), the roles of diverse actors, and farmer demand and its market context, to trace the diffusion of hybrid technology to Latin America, Asia, Europe, and Africa up to 1970. The article also highlights the importance of access to diverse germplasm from the Americas provided by indigenous farmers. A handful of US public institutions promoted the spread of hybrid technology, with US private seed companies sometimes playing a secondary role. However, most cases of successful transfer were led by national scientists embedded in local institutions, who were able to link to local seed systems and farmers. By the mid 1970s, the aggregate impacts of these efforts were of the same magnitude as for the well-known and much publicized green revolution wheat varieties. Nonetheless, adoption of hybrid maize across and within countries was very patchy, relating to differences in scientific capacity, type of farmer, agro-ecology, and complementary investments in seed systems and extension. Consequently, impacts were often highly inequitable.","[{""name"": ""Derek Byerlee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s40656-017-0131-8"", ""10.1007/BF00022431"", ""10.1080/03768359508439804"", ""10.1007/BF01098663"", ""10.1215/00021482-74.2.393"", ""10.1086/451461"", ""10.2307/1905380"", ""10.1080/14735903.2006.9684793"", ""10.5962/bhl.title.145956"", ""10.1177/030631286016003003"", ""10.1590/S0006-87051943001100001"", ""10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183X003900010001x"", ""10.1007/BF02858749"", ""10.2134/agronj1934.00021962002600020002x"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00040-0"", ""10.1093/genetics/169.4.1787"", ""10.2307/j.ctt22726tg"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjnrv65"", ""10.1038/35047587"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican0851-39"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674335882"", ""10.2134/agronj1955.00021962004700010002x"", ""10.1007/BF02908218"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226330297.001.0001"", ""10.2307/3102398"", ""10.1515/9781685851675"", ""10.1126/science.1078710"", ""10.1080/05331846609438425""]",['Agricultural and Biological Sciences'],"['Plant Science', 'General Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7446), ('0909 草学', 0.741)]]"

Concepts such as Buen Vivir are (re‐)discovered and integrated into discourses run mainly by the Global North. This implies an invisibilisation and colonisation of movements, organisations, and people as political actors. This will be traced with the case of Buen Vivir (Sumak Kawsay) in Ecuador, a political concept of indigenous organisations in the Amazon that was taken over by ecologist intellectuals and introduced in discussions on commons and degrowth.

10.1017/S0010417520000043,COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN SOCIETY AND HISTORY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,Terroir and Territory on the Colonial Frontier: Making New-Old World Wine in the Holy Land,"AbstractEtymologically related, the concepts ofterroirandterritorialitydisplay divergent cultural histories. While one designates the palatable characteristics of place as a branded story of geographic distinction, the other imbues the soil with political meaning. This paper traces the production of eno-locality in a contested space on both sides of the Green Line in Israel/Palestine. The case of the Yatir award-winning winery shows how terroir and territory are blended in the political economy and cultural politics of colonial place-making. Located on a multiscalar frontier—climatic, geopolitical, and viticultural—Yatir Winery positions itself simultaneously within the Mediterranean transnational landscape and in a biblical site of historical authenticity. Enacting strategic regimes of signification to target the increasing demand for high-end wines on both the global and local markets, it makes a claim for place, while appropriating Palestinian land and redefining ancient Jewish heritage. The result articulates a settler colonial landscape whose symbolic and material transformations are reflected in the Israeli search for rooted identity. Analytically, we explore the power of border and frontier wines to reconfigure the differences between New World and Old World paradigms. We conclude by outlining a comparative framework of the charged relations between terroir and territory that articulates the nexus between border typologies and the colonial politics of wine.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Monterescu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ariel Handel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv102bhmf"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-102317-050249"", ""10.1525/gfc.2014.14.4.69"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9655.2011.01714.x"", ""10.1057/9780230299191"", ""10.5040/9781350042254.ch-004"", ""10.5204/mcj.948"", ""10.1179/175272608X360238"", ""10.1016/0278-4165(90)90011-2"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2017.10.002"", ""10.1080/17409291003644206"", ""10.1177/0308518X15594917"", ""10.1007/s10624-019-09560-7"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8306.2004.00438.x"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1425.2011.01326.x"", ""10.1525/9780520934139"", ""10.1080/0957126022000017981"", ""10.5040/9781350042254"", ""10.1080/09518960500495172"", ""10.2307/j.ctt2005x0w"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226041285.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev.anthro.28.1.0"", ""10.5153/sro.2339"", ""10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123120"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.2012.01248.x"", ""10.2979/isr.2011.16.1.179"", ""10.1525/9780520966734"", ""10.1177/1463499605050866"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-37059-3"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01251.x"", ""10.2752/175174413X13589681351331"", ""10.1177/0162243911423843"", ""10.1515/9781400835218"", ""10.1177/0003122410372226"", ""10.1111/amet.12827""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Food Science', 'Plant Science', 'Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7261), ('0908 水产', 0.7005)]]"

Conventional models propose that upper slope failures are funneled into submarine canyons and develop into turbidity flows that are routed down-canyon to deep-water channel and fan systems. However, the sources and pathways of these turbidity flows are poorly constrained, leading to uncertainties in the connections between ground shaking, slope failure and deep-water turbidites. We examine the spatial distribution of submarine landslides along the southern Cascadia margin to identify source regions for slope failures that may have developed into turbidity flows. Using multibeam bathymetry, sparker multichannel seismic and chirp sub-bottom data, we observe relatively few canyon head slope failures and limited evidence of large landslides on the upper and middle slope. Most of the submarine canyons are draped with sediment infill in the upper reaches and do not appear to be active sediment conduits during the recent sea-level highstand. In contrast, there is evidence of extensive mass wasting of the lower slope and non-channelized downslope flows. Contrary to previous studies, we propose that failures along the lower slope are the primary sources for deep-sea seismoturbidites in southern Cascadia.","[{""name"": ""Jenna C.

10.1093/ehr/ceaa008,ENGLISH HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,"Settlement, Identity, and Memory in the Latin East: An Examination of the Term 'Crusader States'","Abstract In a recent article, Christopher MacEvitt posited that historians should eschew the term ‘crusader states’ to describe the four polities formed in the Levant and Syria as a result of the First Crusade (the kingdom of Jerusalem, the principality of Antioch, and the counties of Edessa and Tripoli), arguing that crusading and its remembrance had little influence in the east, and so these states should not be viewed as extensions of the west. This paper seeks to offer a critical response to this by making use of the methodological approaches which have recently traced the emergence, influence and definitions of crusading in the Latin West and have re-situated the movement within broader patterns of elite behaviours and cultural identities. The aim, therefore, is to examine the processes of identity formation among Latin settlers in the east, the active remembrance and memorialisation of the First Crusade, and, most especially, what influence the latter had over the nature of inter-cultural contact. It does so by adopting an interdisciplinary approach, which incorporates textual, literary, vernacular, documentary, material and artistic evidence. It will be argued that, although the term ‘crusader state’ cannot be used in a monolithic sense, it nevertheless remains a crucial medium through which to understand the complex social and cultural history of the Latin polities of Outremer, as well as their impact on the Near East. Examination of this concept not only contributes to modern understanding of these states, it also lends greater depth to historiographical discussions on the nature of the crusading movement as a whole.","[{""name"": ""Andrew D Buck"", ""affiliation"": [""University College Dublin""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This controversy stems from the fact that the granites may result from fractionation of mantle-derived basaltic magmas or partial melting of different crustal protoliths at contrasting pressure–temperature conditions, either water-fluxed or fluid-absent. Consequently, many different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the compositional variability of granites ranging from whole igneous suites down to mineral scale. This Special Publication presents an overview of the state of the art and envisages future avenues towards a better understanding of granite petrogenesis.","[{""name"": ""Vojtěch Janoušek"", ""affiliation"": [""Czech Geological Survey, Klárov 3, 118 21 Prague 1, Czech Republic"", ""Institute of Petrology and Structural Geology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Albertov 6, 128 43 Prague 2, Czech Republic""]}, {""name"": ""Bernard Bonin"", ""affiliation"": [""UMR 8148 ‘GEOPS’, Université Paris-Sud, CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay, Bâtiment 504, Rue du Belvédère, F-91405 Orsay Cedex, France""]}, {""name"": ""William J.

The article examines what they had in common, and seeks to understand why they should have ended when they did. It shows that European governors were unanimous in insisting on rigid quarantine and other measures for containing the disease developed over previous centuries, despite their ignorance of plague's precise causes. It shows also that physicians across Europe were more deeply divided than they had ever been on the issue of contagion, and now engaged in an international dispute about whether the acknowledged cruelties inflicted by compulsory quarantines were wholly counterproductive, or a price worth paying for the prevention of still worse disasters. The article concludes by drawing on recent work on plague in the Ottoman Empire, and on research into the ancient DNA of the second pandemic, in order to set the epidemic history of western Europe in a wider comparative context.","[{""name"": ""Paul Slack"", ""affiliation"": [""Linacre College Oxford""]}]","[""10.1093/ereh/het013"", ""10.1080/00324728.2018.1457794"", ""10.1017/S0022050717000092"", ""10.1111/ehr.12652"", ""10.2307/2595837"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511497544"", ""10.1080/0032472031000142976"", ""10.1515/9788376560472"", ""10.2307/j.ctvvnc4d.13"", ""10.7788/boehlau.9783412321109.295"", ""10.1515/9781474423397"", ""10.1093/jhmas/53.2.132"", ""10.17302/TMG.1-1.7"", ""10.1111/1600-0498.12370"", ""10.1017/9781108751773"", ""10.1017/S0025727300072100"", ""10.1111/ehr.12098"", ""10.3917/perri.dupaq.1985.01"", ""10.1353/bhm.2000.0015"", ""10.1353/ecs.2016.0014"", ""10.3917/adh.134.0095"", ""10.1111/1600-0498.12305"", ""10.1111/1600-0498.12303"", ""10.2307/2928672"", ""10.1080/03468750500507495"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195061406.001.0001"", ""10.1162/002219503322645439"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtz009"", ""10.1111/1600-0498.12299"", ""10.1002/bies.201900160"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195055238.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jhmas/XXVIII.1.15"", ""10.1111/ehr.12097"", ""10.2307/2595884"", ""10.21820/23987073.2018.3.60"", ""10.1093/pastj/gty018"", ""10.1038/s41467-019-12154-0"", ""10.17302/TMG.1-1.8"", ""10.2307/j.ctvvnc4d.7"", ""10.1017/npt.2020.27"", ""10.1093/clinids/11.5.808"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbi060"", ""10.1017/S0020743810000814""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']","['Genetics', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0710 生物学', 0.733), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7315)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

We explore how the successful handling of COVID‐19 shaped South Korean citizens' perception of their country. Empirically, we compare data from surveys conducted in August 2019 and April 2020. Using regression on matched samples, we find a significant increase in general national pride. More importantly, we find an increase in positive assessments of their country in domains directly related to the COVID‐19 response (civic awareness and international leadership) but not in domains less directly related to the pandemic. We also find that while Koreans take pride in their collective response to the crisis, their disenchantment with the political class has grown. The implication is that citizens offer a remarkably nuanced understanding of how the COVID‐19 response reflected the strengths of the Korean society, as opposed to the Korean political system.","[{""name"": ""Sijeong Lim"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of International Studies Korea University  Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Aseem Prakash"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Washington  Seattle Washington USA""]}]","[""10.1353/wp.1997.0008"", ""10.1111/bjso.12397"", ""10.1017/nps.2020.35"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00329"", ""10.1177/0003122416663683"", ""10.1080/1362102042000214705"", ""10.1177/0090591701029006008"", ""10.1515/9780804786188"", ""10.1080/713999116"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00012"", ""10.1186/s40985-017-0065-4"", ""10.4324/9781315746111-6"", ""10.1080/01900690701215888"", ""10.1111/pops.12294"", ""10.1017/S0021911818000438"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0335.2011.00900.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123402000248"", ""10.1017/S0022381607080097"", ""10.1017/rep.2015.7"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190209889.001.0001"", ""10.1162/daed.2008.137.3.78"", ""10.1080/03050629.2011.622653"", ""10.1177/1065912908327228"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2011.00803.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12425"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09360-2"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2005.tb02206.x"", ""10.1111/puar.13012"", ""10.1177/1012690209356989""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

What is emerging as genuinely new are the identity‐based nationalisms of the centre left, sometimes called “liberal nationalism” or “progressive patriotism.” I offer my own contribution to the latter, which may be called “multicultural nationalism.” I argue that multiculturalism is a mode of integration that does not just emphasise the centrality of minority group identities but argues that integration is incomplete without remaking national identity so that all can have a sense of belonging to it. This multiculturalist approach to national belonging has some relation to liberal nationalism. It, however, makes not just individual rights but minority accommodation a feature of acceptable nationalism. Moreover, accommodation here particularly includes ethno‐religious groups in ways that are difficult for radical regimes of secularism. For these reasons, multicultural nationalism unites the concerns of some of those currently sympathetic to majoritarian nationalism and those who are prodiversity and minority accommodationist in the way that liberal nationalism (with its emphasis on individualism and majoritarianism) does not. It therefore represents the political idea and tendency most likely to offer a feasible alternative rallying point to monocultural nationalism.","[{""name"": ""Tariq Modood"", ""affiliation"": [""Sociology University of Bristol Bristol UK""]}]","[""10.1177/1468796815604558"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.1177/1468796819827406"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12326"", ""10.1093/0199240981.001.0001"", ""10.3167/9781845454920"", ""10.1177/1468796818787413"", ""10.1080/09502380701470791"", ""10.1111/j.1467-923X.2003.00584.x"", ""10.1002/9781405165518.wbeosm129"", ""10.1057/9781137351548_2"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139177740"", ""10.1515/9781400820849""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This paper aims to develop a strategy for architectural knowledge modeling in order to actively support the built heritage conservation process by fostering collaboration among stakeholders and interoperability between datasets. The integration of two modeling systems, one ontology-based and one in BIM environment, seems to be the right way to meet this objective: the former is rather exhaustive to represent the semantic contents of conservation activities, especially non-geometrical data, the latter is absolutely suitable to represent the logic of the construction, above all geometrical-constructive aspects typical of any architectural organism. Thus, this study proposes a side-by-side approach to synchronize these different ways of representing reality by managing the complexity of cultural heritage on the one hand and of technology tools, such as information systems, on the other. The proposed methodology was tested on the city walls of San Ginesio (Macerata, Italy) and included different steps considering the in-use technologies (notably geomatics and information technologies) as key enablers to acquire, hierarchically order, model and enrich the knowledge of that heritage site. The result is a knowledge-led strategy moving from survey to HBIM implementation, as a way to enhance representation and management in architectural heritage processes.","[{""name"": ""F.

Here we present a geographically well-distributed geochemical dataset comprising flood basalt lavas of the Eocene continental LIP to refine the regional volcano-stratigraphy into three distinct magmatic units: (1) the highly alkaline small-volume Akobo Basalt (49.4–46.6 Ma), representing the initial phase of flood basalt volcanism derived from the melting of lithospheric–mantle metasomes; (2) the primitive and spatially restricted Amaro Basalt (45.2–39.8 Ma), representing the early main phase of flood basalt volcanism derived from the melting of the upwelling thermochemical anomaly; and (3) the spatially extensive Gamo–Makonnen magmatic unit (38–28 Ma), representing the mature main phase of flood basalt volcanism that has undergone significant processing within the lithosphere and resulted in relatively homogeneous compositions. The focused intrusion of these main phase magmas over 10 myr preconditioned the African lithosphere for the localization of strain during subsequent episodes of lithospheric stretching.

The principality lay between impartible northern Europe and the partible southwest. Inequality in landholding size is measured, showing an average Gini of 0.615 and substantial variation across communities. Places with relatively larger populations and ones that practiced impartible inheritance had mostly higher wealth inequality. The main result is that inheritance norms played a role in causing higher landholding inequality. Higher emigration rates in the impartible communities helped to alleviate landholding inequality.","[{""name"": ""Simone A.

The data image part of the Pleistocene to recent shelf to slope to basin-floor Giant Foresets Formation in offshore western New Zealand. The MTD created substantive topographic relief and rugosity at the contemporaneous seabed, formed by the presence of a shallow basal detachment surface, and very large (up to 200 m high) intact slide blocks, respectively. Sediments were initially deflected away from high-relief MTD topography and confined in low areas. With time, the MTD was progressively healed by a series of broadly offset-stacked and increasingly unconfined packages comprised of many channel bodies and their distributary complexes. Positive topography formed by the channels and their distributary complexes further modified the seafloor and influenced the location of subsequent sediment deposition. Channel sinuosity increased over time, interpreted as the result of topographic healing and reduced seafloor gradients. The rate of sediment supply is likely to have been non-uniform, reflecting tectonic pulses across the region. Sediments were routed into deep water via slope-confined channels that originated shortly before emplacement of the MTD.","[{""name"": ""Suzanne Bull"", ""affiliation"": [""GNS Science, 1 Fairway Drive, Lower Hutt, New Zealand, 5010""]}, {""name"": ""Greg H.

This study identifies a number of moderate (&gt;10 km 3 ) to giant (up to 650 km 3 ) mass transport deposits within the Makassar North Basin Pleistocene–Recent section. The majority of submarine landslides that formed these deposits originated from the Mahakam pro-delta, with the largest skewed to the south. We see clear evidence for ocean-current erosion, lateral transport and contourite deposition across the upper slope. This suggests that the ITF is acting as an along-slope conveyor belt, transporting sediment to the south of the delta, where rapid sedimentation rates and slope oversteepening results in recurring submarine landslides. A frequency for the &gt;100 km 3 failures is tentatively proposed at 0.5 Ma, with smaller events occurring at least every 160 ka. This area is therefore potentially prone to tsunamis generated from these submarine landslides. We identify a disparity between historical fault rupture-triggered tsunamis (located along the Palu-Koro fault zone) and the distribution of mass transport deposits in the subsurface. If these newly identified mass failures are tsunamigenic, they may represent a previously overlooked hazard in the region.","[{""name"": ""Rachel E.

The paper looks at the impact of the mix of sectarianism and nationalism on the formation of state institutions and the impact of the latter on this mix. The flawed export of the Westphalian state system to MENA established the structural context—multiple identities, hybrid states—wherein the two identities compete, overlap, and coexist. Next, the factors that explain varying identity patterns in MENA are surveyed and their likely consequences for state formation; then, reversing the analysis, the impact of state formation and state institutions on the nationalism–sectarianism balance is examined. The Syrian case is briefly discussed in order to illustrate the argument, looking at three periods when the identity balance interacted differently with state formation: pre‐Ba'thist Syria when nationalism eclipsed sectarianism; Ba'thist Syria (1970‐2000) when patrimonial instrumentalization of sectarianism was compensated for by inclusive bureaucratic institutions, populist policies, and nationalist ideology; neo‐liberal Syria under Bashar al‐Asad (2000‐2010) when inclusion shrank, reanimating sectarianism; and civil war Syria (2010‐) when partial state failure fostered exclusionary militant sectarianism at the expense of nationalism.","[{""name"": ""Raymond Hinnebusch"", ""affiliation"": [""School of International Relations, Arts Building St Andrews University St Andrews United Kingdom""]}]","[""10.1057/9780230610347"", ""10.4324/9781315143798-15"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897559.008"", ""10.1177/0735275115572153"", ""10.1057/9780230234352"", ""10.1080/00396338.2014.882157"", ""10.1017/S0260210598001430"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804783019.003.0002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897559"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0067"", ""10.1080/19436149.2010.514470"", ""10.4324/9781315143798"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1j2n833.17"", ""10.1162/002081897550483"", ""10.1007/s12116-008-9027-7"", ""10.1163/156913312X638606"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598685.004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897559.003"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511611254"", ""10.1080/01436597.2015.1015788"", ""10.1080/00396339308442672"", ""10.4324/9781315143798-16"", ""10.2307/421307"", ""10.1080/00263207008700137"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897559.009"", ""10.1162/isec.2007.31.4.97"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2009.00398.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490415"", ""10.1093/esr/jcu078"", ""10.1515/9781685853907""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Given a convex relaxation which over-approximates the non-convex activation functions, we encode the violations of activation functions as a cost function and optimize it with respect to the convex relaxation. The cost function, referred to as the Sum-of-Infeasibilities (SoI), is designed so that its minimum is zero and achieved only if all the activation functions are satisfied. We propose a stochastic procedure, , to efficiently minimize the SoI. An extension to a canonical case-analysis-based complete search procedure can be achieved by replacing the convex procedure executed at each search state with . Extending the complete search with achieves multiple simultaneous goals: 1) it guides the search towards a counter-example; 2) it enables more informed branching decisions; and 3) it creates additional opportunities for bound derivation. An extensive evaluation across different benchmarks and solvers demonstrates the benefit of the proposed techniques.

The recent rise of Hong Kong diaspora provides an emerging case of stateless diaspora that introduces new empirical insights into the scholarly literature. Using a mixed‐method research strategy, this study empirically investigates the formation of the Hong Kong diaspora as a ‘historically contingent process’, through which overseas Hongkongers were mobilised during the 2019–20 Anti‐Extradition Bill Movement (critical event) to join global protests (mobilising practices) by diaspora groups and activists (mobilising agents). Achieved transborder outreach across the Global North by mobilising their strong moral and cultural resources, it remains to be seen whether the emerging Hong Kong diaspora will move towards a full‐fledged, sustained identity‐based movement. The case study of Hong Kong diaspora offers new comparative insights and establishes a mixed‐method analytical framework for comparing stateless diaspora worldwide.","[{""name"": ""Brian C. H.

Their effects have been taken as writ through labour market statistics or aggregate measures of gross domestic product. However, by focusing on particular micro-economic spaces, a different story emerges. Using the inner areas of Liverpool as a case-study, this article shows how the city's social and economic problems were underwritten by the decline of the service sector, located around the port. By reading the effects of social and economic change through accounts of the physical environment, it demonstrates how urban decay and dereliction provided material resonance to Liverpool's economic decline. The city's landscape of urban decay and dereliction encompassed the infrastructure of everyday life – housing, roads and even trees – as well as that of economic activity, including the docks and warehouses. Taken together, this article shows how this landscape of urban decay and dereliction came to be constituted as an agent within Liverpool's continued economic decline in the 1970s rather than simply being a reflection of it.","[{""name"": ""Aaron Andrews"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/tcbh/hwy010"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbw022"", ""10.5040/9781474257398"", ""10.1017/CHO9781139815024.014"", ""10.59962/9780774834957"", ""10.1017/S0963926816000730"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwi009"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004175808.i-382"", ""10.1017/S0963926816000298"", ""10.1080/13619469508581356"", ""10.1080/13619460802439382"", ""10.1093/ehr/ceu011"", ""10.1111/hith.10683"", ""10.1017/S0963926813000734"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199212668.003.0008"", ""10.1017/S0066622X00001477"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwv030""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

As soon as the planetary intruded into history, it became impossible to keep it as one naturalized background. By problematizing the planetary, Dipesh Chakrabarty has forced philosophers, historians and anthropologists to extend pluralism to the very ground on which history was supposed to unfold. Hence Bruno Latour’s attempt at counting the number of “planets” whose attractions are simultaneously being felt today on any political question. Each of his eight planets are defined by the disconnect between where they are situated and where they are imagined to be moving, which means that each planet is led by a different and incommensurable philosophy of history. Such a “fictional planetology” is then discussed by Chakrabarty, who reviews the difficulties historians have had in taking the nonhuman (and hence the planet) as a historical agent and then adds to Latour’s count a new planetary body which further complicates the geopolitical situation. The result of their joint effort is to shift questions of philosophy of history to philosophy of geography.","[{""name"": ""Bruno Latour"", ""affiliation"": [""Emeritus Professor, médialab, Sciences Po Paris France""]}, {""name"": ""Dipesh Chakrabarty"", ""affiliation"": [""Lawrence A.

10.1093/ahr/rhaa237,AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,Aztecs Abroad? Uncovering the Early Indigenous Atlantic,"Abstract Indigenous people are often seen as static recipients of transatlantic encounter, influencing the Atlantic world only in their parochial interactions with Europeans, but the reality is that thousands of Native Americans crossed the ocean during the sixteenth century, many unwillingly, but some by choice. As diplomats, entertainers, traders, travelers, and, sadly, most often when enslaved, Indigenous people operated consciously within structures that spanned the ocean and created a worldview that was framed in transatlantic terms. Focusing on purposeful travelers of “Aztec” (Central Mexican) origin, this article uses the distinctive context of the 1500s to rewrite our understandings of the Atlantic world. In the turbulent waters of early empire, we can more easily see Native people as purposeful global actors who created and transformed social, economic, political, and intellectual networks, forging not one but many “Indigenous Atlantics.” This is about more than “looking east from Indian country,” or recovering the transatlantic journeys of Native people, important though both those things are. To find a truly “Indigenous Atlantic,” we must reimagine the history of the ocean itself: as a place of Indigenous activity, imagination, and power.","[{""name"": ""Caroline Dodds Pennock"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Anthropology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The reasons for this are varied: digital historians have often preferred to create scholarship for public audiences, or they have pursued forms of scholarship which do not lend themselves to explicit interpretation. But we contend that digital historians have not had sufficient models of patterns of historical argumentation compatible with digital historical research. In this introduction, we read the articles by Rachel Midura and Leonardo Barleta that appear in this special section, and a series of other articles, in order to show the patterns of historical argumentation that digital historians can pursue. A companion website features versions of the articles by Midura and Barleta, as well as eight additional previously published articles, annotated by their authors to highlight how they developed their historical arguments so they can serve as models for argumentative digital history.","[{""name"": ""Stephen Robertson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lincoln Mullen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Music', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"
10.1093/jsh/shz070,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Access to the Trade: Monopoly and Mobility in European Craft Guilds in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries,"Abstract One of the standard objections against guilds in the premodern world has been their exclusiveness. Guilds have been portrayed as providing unfair advantages to the children of established masters and locals, over immigrants and other outsiders. Privileged access to certain professions and industries is seen as a source of inequality and a disincentive for technological progress. In this paper, we examine this assumption by studying the composition of guild masters and apprentices from a large sample of European towns and cities from 1600 to 1800, focusing on the share who were children of masters or locals. These data offer an indirect measurement of the strength of guild barriers and, by implication, of their monopolies. We find very wide variation between guilds in practice, but most guild masters and apprentices were immigrants or unrelated locals: openness was much more common than closure, especially in larger centers. Our understanding of guild “monopolies” and exclusivity is in need of serious revision.","[{""name"": ""Maarten Prak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clare Haru Crowston"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bert De Munck"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Kissane"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Minns"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ruben Schalk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Patrick Wallis"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

The non-marine Ness Formation and crest parts of the structure contain negligible calcite cement. This localized calcite cement has led to relatively poor reservoir performance since first oil in 1978, although a new suite of wells has boosted production with plans to keep the field active until 2030. Understanding the origin and distribution of calcite cement would help the development of more realistic reservoir models and boost production rates through optimum well location. We have thus used a suite of techniques, including standard point counting, SEM-EDS mineralogy, BSE microscopy, fluid inclusion thermometry and stable isotope analysis, to develop new and improved models of calcite distribution. Calcite seems to have attributes of both early and late diagenetic cement. A 30–40% intergranular volume in calcite cemented beds seems to support pre-compactional growth but high-temperature fluid inclusions and the presence of primary oil inclusions suggest late growth. Much calcite may have developed early but it seems to have recrystallized, and possibly undergone redistribution, at close to maximum burial or had a late growth event. Calcite cement probably originated as marine-derived micrite, bioclasts or early marine cement but adopted the isotopic characteristics of high-temperature growth as it recrystallized. Quartz grains have corroded outlines in calcite-cemented areas with one sample, with 79% calcite cement, displaying signs of nearly total replacement of quartz grains by calcite. The flank localization of calcite cement remains to be explained, although it could be due to primary depositional factors, early diagenetic loss of calcite from crestal regions or late diagenetic loss of calcite from crestal regions. Controversially, the growth of calcite seems to be associated with quartz dissolution, although the geochemical and petrophysical cause of this remains obscure. Diagenetic loss of quartz from sandstones cannot easily be explained by conventional modelling approaches and yet seems to be an important phenomenon in Heather sandstones.","[{""name"": ""Richard H.

The analytical workflows include heavy mineral separation using a wide grain-size window (15–355 μ) analysed through integrated optical analysis, Raman spectroscopy, QEMSCAN microscopy and U–Pb dating of detrital zircon. Upper Jurassic–Cretaceous silt-sized sediments from the Mandawa Basin of central-southern Tanzania have been selected for the scope of this research. Raman-aided heavy mineral analysis reveals garnet and apatite to be the most common minerals together with durable zircon, tourmaline and subordinate rutile. Accessory but diagnostic phases are titanite, staurolite, epidote and monazite. Etch pits on garnet and cockscomb features on staurolite document the significant effect of diagenesis on the pristine heavy mineral assemblage. Multivariate statistical analysis highlights a close association among durable minerals (zircon, tourmaline and rutile, ZTR) while garnet and apatite plot alone reflecting independence between the three groups of variables with garnet increasing in Jurassic samples. Raman data for garnet end-member analysis document different associations between Jurassic (richer in A, Bi and Bii types) and Cretaceous (dominant A, Ci and Cii types) samples. U–Pb dating of detrital zircon and their statistical integration with the above-mentioned datasets provide further insights into changes in provenance and/or drainage systems. Metamorphic rocks of the early and late Pan-African orogeny terranes of the Mozambique Belt and those of the Irumide Belt acted as main source of sediment during the Jurassic. Cretaceous sediments record a broadening of the drainage system reaching as far as the Usagran–Ubendian Belt and the Tanzanian Archean Craton.","[{""name"": ""L.

10.3138/chr.2019-0005,CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,A History of Oil Spills on Long-Distance Pipelines in Canada,"Leaks and spills have been endemic on long-distance oil pipelines in Canada since the mid-twentieth century. Evidence from the National Energy Board (neb) pipeline incident reports reveals a track record of thousands of spills totalling millions of litres of oil across the country. What causes onshore oil spills? Why do they occur? Where have they occurred? What have been the environmental consequences of these incidents? This article explores the history of onshore oil spills on federally regulated long-distance pipelines since the mid-twentieth century. It argues that oil pipeline spills are an endemic characteristic of complex enviro-technical systems built primarily for economic efficiency rather than environmental protection. Based on the analysis of incident reports submitted to the neb, the article finds that, while frequent, onshore oil spills in Canada have been variable in scale and have had a wide range of potential adverse environmental effects, depending on location, product type, and volume. The causes of such spills have also been variable, conforming to no obvious pattern over time. Instead, oil pipeline spills have occurred most often in an unpredictable fashion, posing great challenges for policy development. These spills have also represented a proportionally small fraction of the total oil delivered on Canada’s long-distance pipelines, but, in absolute terms, this has meant the uncontrolled release of many millions of litres of oil into the environment.","[{""name"": ""Sean Kheraj"", ""affiliation"": [""Canadian and environmental history at York University""]}]","[""10.7551/mitpress/8157.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262035774.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674970731"", ""10.1515/9780773599529-012"", ""10.59962/9780774833066"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262036511.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781552385418"", ""10.1139/er-2017-0003"", ""10.2307/890588""]",['Environmental Science'],['Pollution'],"[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)]]"
10.1111/1468-0424.12497,GENDER AND HISTORY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,'Rejoice! Your wombs will not beget slaves!' Marronnage as Reproductive Justice in Colonial Haiti,"ABSTRACTThis paper explores the possible existence of organic reproductive justice actions among enslaved mothers and pregnant women in colonial Haiti (Saint Domingue) with specific focus on how marronnage – escape from slavery – provided them opportunities to exert power over their lives, bodies and biological reproduction. Reproductive justice is defined as the complete well‐being of women and girls, based on their human right to decide when and how to have – or not have – children, and to parent existing children in safe and sustainable communities. The conditions of enslavement in Haiti were particularly detrimental to women's control over their fertility and overall reproductive health as birth rates remained so low that the enslaved population could not reproduce itself; however, findings from an underutilized archival roster containing demographic information on the only formally recognized community of maroons from colonial Haiti, the Maniel, indicate that the child‐woman ratio among fugitive women was over twice as high as their counterparts who remained enslaved on plantations. Subversive reading of runaway slave advertisements also suggests that choosing to abscond was a rare but effective mechanism for women to achieve reproductive justice by exercising agency over their lives and protecting their childbearing capabilities. By highlighting motherhood during a state of fugitivity in one of the most economically prosperous slave societies in modern history, this paper can help establish historical precedent for contemporary reproductive justice claims. Moreover, maroon mothers' organic acts of reproductive justice have important implications for the study of how black women resist structures of racial capitalism that negatively impact their reproductive health and other areas of their lives.","[{""name"": ""Crystal Eddins"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History and Philosophy of Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The state-of-the-art proof system that allows for compact proof certificates ispropagation redundancy(PR). However, the only existing method to validate proofs in this system with a formally verified tool requires a transformation to a weaker proof system, which can result in a significant blowup in the size of the proof and increased proof validation time. This paper describes the first approach to formally verify PR proofs on a succinct representation; we present (i) a newLinear PR(LPR) proof format, (ii) a tool to efficiently convert PR proofs into LPR format, and (iii) , a verified LPR proof checker developed in CakeML. The LPR format is backwards compatible with the existing LRAT format, but extends the latter with support for the addition of PR clauses. Moreover, is verified using CakeML ’s binary code extraction toolchain, which yields correctness guarantees for its machine code (binary) implementation. This further distinguishes our clausal proof checker from existing ones because unverified extraction and compilation tools are removed from its trusted computing base. We experimentally show that LPR provides efficiency gains over existing proof formats and that the strong correctness guarantees are obtained without significant sacrifice in the performance of the verified executable.","[{""name"": ""Yong Kiam Tan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marijn J.

It focuses on three women, Elizabeth Dale, Rebecka Duteil and Mary Goodal, who navigated the EIC, parliament and the courts in seventeenth‐century London to try to secure their inheritance from husbands and siblings. It offers a fresh perspective on early modern women's public lives by focusing on a wide array of agentic strategies that women employed in their encounters with various institutions. Using a range of sources, including company records, petitions, court depositions and wills, it argues that exploring women's interactions with the EIC, especially in their role as adversaries, enriches understandings of women's agency in early modern England. This article suggests that such a lens can further nuance how we understand the inherent tensions of early modern women's public lives: as inflected by global as well as local contexts and shaped by conflict as well as collaboration.","[{""name"": ""Aske Laursen Brock"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Misha Ewen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

'Whore' Stigma and the East/West Politics of Race, Sexuality and Gender","Drawing on two ethnographic projects, one among Russian-speaking women engaged in commercial sex, the other among young Russian-speaking migrants in Finland, we interrogate how the construct of Eastern European female body is positioned in relation to the norm of (Western) Europeanness and white femininity. We show how Russian-speaking migrant women in Finland learn of their ‘Russianness’ and ‘Easternness’ through the circulation of the ‘whore’ stigma. We analyse these processes of racialisation and sexualisation in the context of the Finnish national project based on gender equality and women’s liberation norms. While normative Western Europeanness has recently been constructed through emancipated sexuality and the exclusion of non-Western Others as sexually repressed, the bodies of Russian-speaking women are perceived as sexually excessive and in need of toning down. Focusing on the (self-)policing of Russian-speaking migrant women’s bodies and the ways they navigate acceptable and unacceptable forms of gendered self-presentation, we demonstrate how these women are construed as not emancipated enough and hence not quite white. The article thereby contributes to understanding hierarchies of whiteness within the East/West dynamics of race as they pertain to gender and sexuality.","[{""name"": ""Daria Krivonos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anastasia Diatlova"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In particular, the current techniques typically analyze executions by unfolding transitions one step at a time, and the slow growth of execution length prevents detection of deep counterexamples before the tool reaches its limits on computations. We propose a novel model-checking algorithm that is capable of both proving unbounded safety and finding long counterexamples. The idea is to use Craig interpolation to guide the creation of symbolic abstractions ofexponentially longer sequences of transitions. Our experimental analysis shows that on unsafe benchmarks with deep counterexamples our implementation can detect faulty executions that are at least an order of magnitude longer than those detectable by the state-of-the-art tools.","[{""name"": ""Martin Blicha"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Grigory Fedyukovich"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Antti E.

Detailed geological mapping, stratigraphic reconstruction and outcrop description, supported by structural analysis, allowed the architectural characterization of the TGIC. The complex is described as two main stratigraphically constrained intervals: (1) a lower interval (250 m thick) emplaced into clay-rich mudrock, consisting dominantly of sills with stepped and multilayered geometry; and (2) an upper interval (200 m thick) characterized by injection breccia and large wing-like intrusions ( c. 600 m width × 100 m high) emplaced within predominantly biosiliceous mudrock strata. The intrusions in both intervals were derived from turbiditic channel fills intensely modified by sand fluidization. Sandstone intrusions and fractures affecting host strata are dominantly oriented sub-parallel to the basin axis striking between NW–SE and N–S, mainly dipping to NE and forming asymmetric saucer-shaped intrusions, suggesting structurally driven hydraulic fracturing and sand emplacement. The absence of a deep aquifer and potential sand sources underlying the complex suggests a lateral contribution of fluid flow. The TGIC occurs at a scale similar to injection complexes recognized in the subsurface and is a valuable reservoir analogue for hydrocarbon accumulations associated with sand injectites.","[{""name"": ""G.

10.1093/pastj/gtab015,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,"The Pervasiveness of Lordship (Italy, 1050-1500)*","Abstract The impact of medieval lordship on the society it dominated has not received the attention it deserves. This article stresses the need to look at lordship from the bottom up, making an effort to understand how much and in which ways lordship weighed on the life of subjects, by developing the notion of its ‘pervasiveness’. Such a concept is arguably the most effective if we want to evaluate how seigneurial power was more, or less, able and willing to deeply influence the people subject to it. It highlights that in the world of lordship there was a disconnect (or at least potentially) between political power and socio-economic domination. Which factors enabled lordships to become pervasive, and which lords, from which regions, were best equipped with these characteristics? Using the influential French historiographical framework as a starting point, the article considers as case studies a set of signorie in several Italian regions. It highlights the differences between the great territorial lordships of the counts of the Kingdom of Sicily, the barons of Rome and the lords of Lombardy, on the one side, and the innumerable knightly lordships at a lower level on the other. The use of pervasiveness helps us to re-conceptualize lordship itself with different criteria.","[{""name"": ""Sandro Carocci"", ""affiliation"": [""Università di Roma ‘Tor Vergata’ , Italy""]}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Classics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6825), ('0602 中国史', 0.6817)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The plate formed by Early Cretaceous to Miocene amalgamation of four crustal types: the Caribbean Large Igneous Province oceanic plateau; the Chortis continental block; the related Great Arc of the Caribbean and Siuna/Mesquito Composite Oceanic Terranes island arc blocks; and the Colombian and Venezuelan basin oceanic crust. We characterize each terrane through interpretation of surface geology, 62 000-line-km of 2D seismic reflection data, 366 seismic refraction stations, 47 wells, 74 basement samples, 2D forward modelling, magnetic and gravity anomaly grids, and integration of previous studies. Basins overlying island arc crust are small, fault-bounded and deep, while on continental crust, they are broader and shallower. Strongly flexed oceanic and oceanic plateau crust along amagmatic subduction zones on the southern and northeastern edges of the Caribbean plate produce the largest and deepest sediment-filled basins. Areas of proven hydrocarbon source rocks and mapped seeps are associated with continental and island arc terranes in the western Caribbean plate, while organically-rich, but immature, Late Cretaceous source rocks occur across the more elevated areas of the central and eastern Caribbean plate interior.","[{""name"": ""Sean Romito"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paul Mann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2009.10.003"", ""10.1029/JZ066i011p03793"", ""10.1130/G46708.1"", ""10.1130/B35037.1"", ""10.1029/2019TC005741"", ""10.1029/2002JB002040"", ""10.3133/ofr02414"", ""10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2015.02.008"", ""10.1306/13531950M1083653"", ""10.1029/93TC01185"", ""10.1016/S1874-5997(99)80049-5"", ""10.1306/13531935M1083641"", ""10.1029/2018JB016369"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(88)90122-9"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1993)105<1321:DHOTWC>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1988)100<0534:UCSOTW>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1111/j.1365-246X.1979.tb01031.x"", ""10.1016/0264-8172(87)90022-5"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2018.07.020"", ""10.1146/annurev.ea.16.050188.001221"", ""10.1029/94JB02770"", ""10.1306/12081717221"", ""10.1306/13531951M1083654"", ""10.1029/2007JB005373"", ""10.2973/odp.proc.sr.120.202.1992"", ""10.1190/1.2837309"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2017.04.029"", ""10.1029/JB088iB08p06449"", ""10.1111/j.1747-5457.1992.tb00873.x"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(77)90003-6"", ""10.1029/TC005i004p00703"", ""10.1029/JB086iB09p07901"", ""10.1016/S1874-5997(99)80053-7"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1998)026<1043:DOTCRO>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1016/S1874-5997(99)80054-9"", ""10.1016/0025-3227(91)90236-W"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2018.12.021"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2010.01.016"", ""10.1029/2006JB004323"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2013.07.006"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2016.03.013"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1954)65[165:GAASOT]2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1957)68[897:GIITEC]2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1029/JZ065i012p04087"", ""10.1080/00206814.2015.1027747"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(70)90041-7"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(71)90011-4"", ""10.1190/INT-2016-0176.1"", ""10.1029/2019GC008340"", ""10.1029/94TC00923"", ""10.1029/JB088iB12p10585"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2007.08.003"", ""10.1144/SP328.14"", ""10.1029/1999GC000020"", ""10.1029/JB082i030p04861"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican1185-116"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(98)00139-3"", ""10.1130/GES01421.1"", ""10.1111/j.1365-246X.1974.tb05423.x"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(98)00067-5"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1999)111<1581:ANPTMO>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1029/2011TC002918"", ""10.1029/ME001p0041"", ""10.1029/1998JB900091"", ""10.1111/j.1747-5457.1991.tb00312.x"", ""10.1046/j.1365-246x.2000.00059.x"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(94)00268-E"", ""10.1046/j.1365-246X.1998.00489.x"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(97)00103-0"", ""10.1002/2017GC007280"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2017.11.026"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(76)90145-X"", ""10.1144/0016-76492010-067"", ""10.1093/petrology/egt025"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1952)63[777:SRMITA]2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1029/JB082i005p00803"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1977)5<105:PAGOMR>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1016/0025-3227(80)90069-9"", ""10.1029/TC001i002p00179"", ""10.1144/SP328.1"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(88)90262-4"", ""10.1007/978-1-4684-8535-6_7"", ""10.2973/dsdp.proc.15.122.1973"", ""10.1086/317953"", ""10.1029/TC009i005p01037"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(86)90046-4"", ""10.1029/JB093iB03p02141"", ""10.1016/j.orggeochem.2006.07.012"", ""10.1144/SP431.3"", ""10.1306/05111816516"", ""10.1016/j.revmic.2015.02.002"", ""10.1126/science.1258213"", ""10.1029/95TC01928"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(88)90006-4"", ""10.2973/odp.proc.sr.165.029.2000"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(97)00214-8"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(2001)113<0256:ARATVG>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(81)90149-7"", ""10.1306/12191817068"", ""10.1007/978-1-4684-8535-6_1"", ""10.1126/science.187.4179.834"", ""10.1002/2015EA000107"", ""10.1111/j.1365-246X.1975.tb00632.x"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1988)016<0631:CSOAAW>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1029/92JB01749"", ""10.1306/01031110106""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],['Geophysics'],"[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"

As scheduling non-determinism creates exponentially large spaces of thread interleavings, SMC attempts to partition this space into equivalence classes and explore only a few representatives from each class. The efficiency of this approach depends on two factors: (a) the coarseness of the partitioning, and (b) the time to generate representatives in each class. For this reason, the search for coarse partitionings that are efficiently explorable is an active research challenge.In this work we present$${\text {RVF-SMC}}$$RVF-SMC, a new SMC algorithm that uses a novelreads-value-from (RVF)partitioning. Intuitively, two interleavings are deemed equivalent if they agree on the value obtained in each read event, and read events induce consistent causal orderings between them. The RVF partitioning is provably coarser than recent approaches based on Mazurkiewicz and “reads-from” partitionings. Our experimental evaluation reveals that RVF is quite often a very effective equivalence, as the underlying partitioning is exponentially coarser than other approaches. Moreover,$${\text {RVF-SMC}}$$RVF-SMCgenerates representatives very efficiently, as the reduction in the partitioning is often met with significant speed-ups in the model checking task.","[{""name"": ""Pratyush Agarwal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Krishnendu Chatterjee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shreya Pathak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andreas Pavlogiannis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Viktor Toman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/263699.263717"", ""10.1007/3-540-60761-7"", ""10.1145/1273442.1250785"", ""10.1145/3434325"", ""10.1007/s100090050035"", ""10.1007/3-540-56922-7_34"", ""10.1007/3-540-17906-2_30"", ""10.1145/1040305.1040315"", ""10.1145/2535838.2535845"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96142-2_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_14"", ""10.1007/3-540-56922-7_36"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_26"", ""10.1145/3360599"", ""10.1145/3158119"", ""10.1145/3360576"", ""10.1145/3360550"", ""10.1145/2737924.2737975"", ""10.1137/S0097539794279614"", ""10.1145/3276505"", ""10.1007/s00236-016-0275-0"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314609"", ""10.1145/3158105"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_16"", ""10.1145/3371085"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_21"", ""10.1145/2806886""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Preconditioning of the seafloor for failure results from high sedimentation rates coupled with slope over-steepening, under-consolidation and abundant biogenic gas production. Catastrophic failure of production platforms and pipelines due to seafloor displacement during infrequent large hurricanes such as Camille in 1969 and Ivan in 2004, point to cyclical loading of the seafloor by waves as a primary movement trigger. Due to data limitations, the role of smaller storms and background oceanographic processes in driving seafloor movement has remained largely unconstrained but these are thought to contribute to significant seafloor change. With the aid of new high-resolution multibeam mapping and seismic reflection profiling across sections of the MRDF, several moving features within the deforming delta-front environment are investigated and potential hazards to infrastructure installed and adjacent to the region are discussed. Via repeat mapping surveys of selected areas and records of changing shipwreck locations, we highlight significant seafloor displacement across annual to decadal timescales. For example, individual blocks mapped within mudflow gullies adjacent to Southwest Pass show downslope transport of more than 80 m in a single year, while the SS Virginia , a 153 m-long oil tanker sunk in 1942, has been relocated and found to have moved downslope more than 400 m in 14 years, without a major hurricane (&gt;Category 2) passing through the region.","[{""name"": ""Jason D.

10.1111/hith.12268,HISTORY AND THEORY,0603 World History,NATURAL HISTORIES FOR THE ANTHROPOCENE: KOSELLECK'S THEORIES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A HISTORY OF LIFETIMES,"ABSTRACTIn this article, I offer a rereading of Reinhart Koselleck that puts his work at the center of ongoing debates about how to write histories that can account for humanity's changed and changing relationship to our natural environment—or, in geological terms, to our planet. This involves engaging with the urgent realities of climate crisis and the geological agency of humans, which, in current discourse, are often designated by the concept of the Anthropocene. This article asks whether Koselleck's essays from the 1970s and after contain ideas, arguments, theories, and methods that may prove useful in collapsing “the age‐old humanist distinction between natural history and human history,” to use Dipesh Chakrabarty's phrase. Indeed, the unlikeliness of providing a positive answer to this question is itself an important motivation for raising it. The other motivation is the supposition that the difficulties in bridging the gap between human and natural history fundamentally has to do with time and, more specifically, with the divergent temporal frameworks governing different historiographies, which are in part practiced in natural sciences such as geology, biology, and meteorology. The first part of this article discusses what one could call Koselleck's temporal anthropocentrism, which was handed down in German historicism and hermeneutics from the eighteenth century onward in the shape of what I call the Vitruvian Man of Time. In Koselleck's work, this superimposition of the human onto the multiple lifetimes of the planet is most clearly expressed in his claim about the “denaturalization” of history at the beginning of modernity. The second part of this article observes a shift in Koselleck's engagement with nature beginning in the 1980s; this shift is presented in terms of a “renaturalization.” The theoretical and methodological tool for this re‐entanglement of the times of history and the times of nature is his theory of multiple times. Originally limited to the human, this theory rises to the task of including an increasing number of natural times that are no longer perceived as stable, static, and slow but as continuously accelerating due to “human use.” In conclusion, this article suggests that Koselleck's work offers the framework for a theory of “lifetimes” that can replace modernist history as platform for writing new natural histories for the future.","[{""name"": ""HELGE JORDHEIM"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oslo""]}]",[],['Environmental Science'],['Nature and Landscape Conservation'],"[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)]]"

After offering a characterization of the post-2012 “state-civilization” discourse from above, I examine how ordinary people imagine Russia as a “state-civilization.” Interview narratives of inclusion into the nation are found to overlap with state discourse on three main lines: (1) ethno-nationalism is rejected, and Russia is imagined to be a unique, harmonious multi-ethnic space in which the Russians (russkie) lead without repressing the others; (2) Russia’s multinationalism is remembered in myths of peaceful interactions between Russians (russkie) and indigenous ethnic groups (korennyye narodi) across the imperial and Soviet past; (3) Russian culture and language are perceived as the glue that holds together a unified category of nationhood. Interview narratives on exclusion deviate from state discourse in two key areas: attitudes to the North Caucasus reveal the geopolitical-security, post-imperial aspect of the “state-civilization” identity, while stances toward non-Slavic migrants in city spaces reveal a degree of “cultural nationalism” that, while sharing characteristics with those of Western Europe, is also based on Soviet-framed notions of normality. Overall, the article contributes to debates on how Soviet legacies and Russia’s post-imperial consciousness play out in the context of the “pro-Putin consensus.”","[{""name"": ""Matthew Blackburn"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13569319808420771"", ""10.1080/10758216.2016.1225264"", ""10.1080/09668136.2011.547693"", ""10.2753/RUP1061-1940480103"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2015.1076959"", ""10.1177/107780049500100103"", ""10.2753/RUP1061-1940500503"", ""10.1080/09668136.2014.986965"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0012"", ""10.1016/j.euras.2010.04.001"", ""10.1080/00905992.2014.923390"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511894732.010"", ""10.1080/09668136.2014.988999"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0003"", ""10.1515/9781474433877-007"", ""10.1080/21567689.2015.1068167"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0010"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0011"", ""10.1016/B978-008044910-4.00420-X"", ""10.4324/9780203960899"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12188"", ""10.1177/0010414002035005003"", ""10.1515/9781474433877-016"", ""10.1515/9781474433877-008"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0006"", ""10.1057/9780230282940_5"", ""10.1162/DAED_a_00437"", ""10.1057/9780230282940_6"", ""10.1080/0143659042000322937""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This study shows that, given limited historical data, median incomes are most appropriate for measuring welfare and inequality, while urban unskilled wages can be used to test dualist models of development. We present new estimates of these series for Mexico from 1800 to 2015 and find that both have historically failed to keep up with aggregate growth: GDP per worker is now over eight times higher than in the nineteenth century, while unskilled urban real wages are only 2.2 times higher, and national median incomes only 2.0 times higher. From the perspective of inequality and social welfare, our findings confirm that there is no automatic positive relationship between economic growth and rising living standards for the majority. From the perspective of development, we argue that these findings are explained by a dual economy model incorporating Lewis's assumption of a reserve army of labour, and we explain why the decline in inequality predicted by Kuznets has not occurred.","[{""name"": ""Ingrid Bleynat"", ""affiliation"": [""King's College London""]}, {""name"": ""Amílcar E.

This coincided with more women participating directly in the stock market. This study analyses whether these female shareholders chose to invest independently of men. Using a novel dataset of almost 500,000 shareholders in some of the largest British railways, it shows that women were much more likely to be solo shareholders than men.

The digitalization of the process for building permit (involving the use of 3D information systems) is seen as a priority in a wide part of the world. Since it is a very multidisciplinary use case, involving a variety of stakeholders tackling complex issues and topics, some of them joined their efforts and skills in the European Network for Digital Building Permit. The initial activity of the network, after a review of on-going experiences, was a workshop to share knowledge about the topics involved and to identify the main ambitions of the network with respect to three pillars (i.e. Process – Rules and Requirements – Technology) and the related requirements. It was achieved through a collective brainstorming activity guided by digital tools, whose results were further analysed in a post-processing phase. Such results are presented in this paper and will be the base for planning the future network activity.","[{""name"": ""F. Noardo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G.

10.1017/S0018246X20000163,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,"INDIAN RIVERS, 'PRODUCTIVE WORKS', AND THE EMERGENCE OF LARGE DAMS IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY MADRAS","AbstractThe nineteenth century witnessed a major expansion in the construction of public works including canals, roads, and railways across the British empire. The question that colonial governments faced during the nineteenth century was on how to finance public works. Focusing specifically on irrigation works and the rivers of southern India, this article shows how different experiments were attempted, including raising capital and labour from local communities as well as corporate investment in irrigation works through London capital markets. The article argues that by the latter part of the nineteenth century, a definitive answer had emerged, i.e. irrigation projects on rivers would be financed through state debt. An enormous body of scholarship in Britain and India debated the relationship between public works and public debt. This article rethinks this scholarship as a technological and environmental history. The article argues that colonial modes of raising capital were dependent on speculating on Indian rivers. Historiography wise, in contrast to scholarship which takes for granted the role of the state in building large dams, it suggests that the emergence of the state as the builder of large dams was part of a more fundamental relationship between rivers, technology, and colonial capital that emerged in the nineteenth century.","[{""name"": ""ADITYA RAMESH"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199590414.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0021909610388015"", ""10.1017/9781108348867"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190648664.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1478-0542.2006.00336.x"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00008167"", ""10.4324/9781315677798"", ""10.1007/s12685-018-0226-5"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511993398"", ""10.1177/001946469603300102"", ""10.2307/3516353"", ""10.1111/j.1471-0366.2009.00262.x"", ""10.1515/9781400835072"", ""10.1163/15685209-12341472"", ""10.1177/0257643017736402"", ""10.1086/530931"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521563192"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195682175.001.0001"", ""10.1093/past/123.1.141"", ""10.1177/025764300301900103"", ""10.1525/california/9780520285293.001.0001"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-45740-0_5"", ""10.1111/anti.12216"", ""10.1017/S0020859014000170"", ""10.1093/shm/hkq112""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

An Essay,"Abstract Until now, the relatively quiet transition from traditional Graeco-Roman religion to Christianity has gone unexplained. In dialogue with James Rives and Jörg Rüpke, I argue that Christianity made better use than its religious competition of long-term trends in the Roman Empire, such as expanding literacy, the rejection of sacrifice, the movement toward monotheism, and the closing of the distance between gods and their faithful. The growing skepticism within the city elites regarding the credibility of its traditional religion, the decrease in investments in its material side, and the strength of the Christian organizations were additional factors together with contingent events, such as Constantine’s victory and his long rule.","[{""name"": ""Jan N.

10.1093/tcbh/hwaa006,TWENTIETH CENTURY BRITISH HISTORY,0603 World History,Going Places or Out of Place? Representations of Mobile Girls and Young Women in Late-1950s and 1960s Britain,"Abstract Spatial mobilities are a neglected dimension of the historiography of post-war youth and yet, as this article argues, in the late 1950s and 1960s, mobilities became integral to a redefinition of young femininity. Examining media targeting girls and young women, as well as national newspapers and women’s magazines, this article explores the popularization of the idea that girls in their teens and early twenties were on the move and that particular kinds of mobility were a feature of modern girlhood. Whether out and about, travelling or migrating to cities, mobilities were often portrayed as empowering girls and facilitating transitions to adulthood; for these reasons, girls were encouraged to embrace opportunities to be going places, even if this meant challenging personal boundaries. This empowering new ideal came at a cost: youth, and the passage to adulthood, became riskier for girls. Only a thin line separated going places from out of place, as the most transformative mobilities took girls away from the parental home and other forms of adult supervision. There were long-established dangers posed by predatory men, but also new ones posed by going it alone—sexual and domestic exploitation, loneliness; risky mobilities were often less about travel than arriving someplace else. Financial resources helped safeguard girls, but survival increasingly depended on personal resources. Mobilities became a new axis of social differentiation, dividing the girls who were going places, literally and in terms of social status and cultural capital, from those who were out of place or stuck in place.","[{""name"": ""Penny Tinkler"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Manchester, UK""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Go differentiates itself from other imperative languages by offering structural subtyping and lightweight concurrency through goroutines with message-passing communication. This combination of features poses interesting challenges for static verification, most prominently the combination of a mutable heap and advanced concurrency primitives.We present Gobra, a modular, deductive program verifier for Go that proves memory safety, crash safety, data-race freedom, and user-provided specifications. Gobra is based on separation logic and supports a large subset of Go. Its implementation translates an annotated Go program into the Viper intermediate verification language and uses an existing SMT-based verification backend to compute and discharge proof obligations.","[{""name"": ""Felix A.

Here, we evaluate the influence of free gas on the soil's shear strength and submarine slope failures in areas with gassy soils based on an extensive literature review. We identify two potential destabilization mechanisms: gas bubbles in the pore space lead to a reduced shear strength of the soil and/or gas induces excess pore pressures that consequently reduce the effective stress in the soil. Our evaluation of the reported mechanical and hydraulic behaviour of gassy sediments indicates that the unfavourable impact of entrapped gas on a soil's shearing resistance is not sufficient to trigger large-scale slope failures. Liquefaction failure due to high gas pressures is, however, a viable scenario in coarse-grained soils. Transferring the gas influence on the soil mechanical behaviour to constitutive models is identified as the most important prerequisite for a successful future analysis of slope stability.","[{""name"": ""P.

As in many countries, in The Netherlands governmental organisations are acquiring 3D city models to support their public tasks. However, this is still being done within individual organisation, resulting in differences in 3D city models within one country and sometimes covering the same area: i.e. differences in data structure, height references used, update cycle, data quality, use of the 3D data etc. In addition, often only large governmental organisations can afford investing in 3D city models (and the required knowledge) and not small organisations, like small municipalities. To address this problem, the Dutch Kadaster is collaborating with the 3D Geoinformation research group at TU Delft to generate and disseminate a 3D city model covering the whole of the Netherlands and to do this in a sustainable manner, i.e. with an implementation that ensures periodical updates and that aligns with the 3D city models of other governmental organisations, such as large cities. This article describes the workflow that has been developed and implemented.","[{""name"": ""B. Dukai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R. Peters"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T.

10.1093/ahr/rhac012,AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,Fiduciary Colonialism Annuities and Native Dispossession in the Early United States,"Abstract Federal officials in the early United States built an empire by purchase. But rather than hand over lump sums for Native lands, officials offered annual payments, or annuities. This article traces annuities’ material evolution from payments in goods to high-powered money—especially specie—and their financial evolution from straightforward congressional outlays to interest accrued on investments held in trust. Annuities originated as devices that could permit territorial expansion within considerable military-fiscal constraints. But once in use, they became potent instruments of federal power, shoring up officials’ capacity to intrude on Native economies, wrench further territorial transfers, and channel Indigenous wealth as capital for the very infrastructural projects that spread US settlement. Overall, annuities and the trust funds into which they evolved anchored a strategy of dispossession I call fiduciary colonialism: a mode of territorial acquisition and population management carried out through the expansion of administrative control over Native peoples’ wealth. In the face of federal claims to financial superiority, Indigenous peoples did not wither into wardship. Rather, they engaged trusteeship with their own futures in mind, applying annuities and trusts toward social institutions that would allow their nations to survive the ordeal of dispossession.","[{""name"": ""Emilie Connolly"", ""affiliation"": [""Assistant Professor, Brandeis University""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This paper examines the benefits and challenges from stakeholders' experiences and perspectives (business students, start-ups and universities). The authors focus on the entrepreneurial values obtained by exploring start-up processes, culture and work environments.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses qualitative research with a case study approach by applying experiential learning. The objects of this research are students of the School of Business and Management and start-ups in Indonesia. This study divides the pilot program of internship at start-ups into three stages, designing process, execution and evaluation. The analysis technique uses an interpretive approach from interviews and observations of internships based on experiential learning.FindingsThe results showed that the internship program at start-ups in this study has benefits for all major stakeholders, especially students. The results of student learning experiences show that start-ups' characteristics such as a creative work environment, egalitarian work culture and dynamic workflow flexibility can increase their professional and moral values.Research limitations/implicationsThis study has several limitations, including the internship program designed in this study, which is still raw and has several shortcomings. Time series in testing experiential learning is another limitation. For further study, it is necessary to conduct longitudinal research to measure the effectiveness of the start-ups' internship program.Originality/valueThis study provides new insights on experiential learning in developing an internship program at a start-up as an effort to increase entrepreneurial value for business students. This study highlights the possibility that an internship program at a start-up will have an impact on students' entrepreneurial values and competencies.","[{""name"": ""Donald Crestofel Lantu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yulianto Suharto"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ira Fachira"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anggraeni Permatasari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Grisna Anggadwita"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/JSTPM-03-2018-0024"", ""10.1108/02621711311318283"", ""10.7748/nr2012.11.20.2.40.c9442"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-07-2017-0044"", ""10.5367/000000007780222688"", ""10.5367/000000004773040924"", ""10.4324/9780203891414"", ""10.1108/00400911011017690"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-2846-2_2"", ""10.1002/j.2161-1920.2008.tb00045.x"", ""10.1108/14626000810871745"", ""10.1016/j.labeco.2015.11.002"", ""10.1108/13552550910967921"", ""10.1108/AJIM-05-2019-0123"", ""10.1080/14703297.2016.1228468"", ""10.1108/ET-11-2016-0164"", ""10.1207/s15427625tcq1002_7"", ""10.1080/08832320903252397"", ""10.1007/s11365-017-0491-2""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Education']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

The new generation of CSs employs the Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) paradigm by implementing novel standards such as the ISO 15118. This standard enables high-level communication between the vehicle and the charging column, helps manage the charge smartly, and simplifies the payment phase. This novel charging paradigm, which connects the Smart Grid to external networks (e.g., EVs and CSs), has not been thoroughly examined yet. Therefore, it may lead to dangerous vulnerability surfaces and new research challenges.In this paper, we presentEVExchange, the first attack to steal energy during a charging session in a V2G communication: i.e., charging the attacker’s car while letting the victim pay for it. Furthermore, if reverse charging flow is enabled, the attacker can even sell the energy available on the victim’s car! Thus, getting the economic profit of this selling, and leaving the victim with a completely discharged battery. We developed a virtual and a physical testbed in which we validate the attack and prove its effectiveness in stealing the energy. To prevent the attack, we propose a lightweight modification of the ISO 15118 protocol to include a distance bounding algorithm. Finally, we validated the countermeasure on our testbeds. Our results show that the proposed countermeasure can identify all the relay attack attempts while being transparent to the user.","[{""name"": ""Mauro Conti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Denis Donadel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Radha Poovendran"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Federico Turrin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-05195-2_38"", ""10.1109/MNET.001.1900348"", ""10.1007/s00450-017-0342-y"", ""10.1007/3-540-48285-7_30"", ""10.1145/3565268"", ""10.1145/3339252.3339269"", ""10.1145/3422337.3447829"", ""10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160477"", ""10.1109/JSAC.2006.874404"", ""10.1016/j.epsr.2010.08.007"", ""10.1109/CNSM.2015.7367387"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-16822-2_4"", ""10.1145/3407023.3407066"", ""10.1016/j.cose.2009.06.001"", ""10.1109/CCST.2014.6987031"", ""10.1145/2517968.2517971"", ""10.1109/RFID.2014.6810722"", ""10.1109/ICITCS.2014.7021815"", ""10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497830"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04864-8_3"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2017.01.020"", ""10.1145/3485832.3485920"", ""10.1109/TSG.2010.2090910"", ""10.1016/j.epsr.2020.106695"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3031979"", ""10.1145/2766498.2766504"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-53565-8.00020-8"", ""10.1109/VPPC.2015.7353006"", ""10.1109/FSKD.2012.6234155""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Nowadays 3D city models have become an essential part of 3D GIS environments and they can be used in many applications and analyses in urban areas. The conventional 3D building reconstruction methods depend heavily on the data quality and source; and manual efforts are still needed for generating the object models. Several tasks in photogrammetry and remote sensing have been revolutionized by using deep learning (DL) methods, such as image segmentation, classification, and 3D reconstruction. In this study, we provide a review on the state-of-the-art machine learning and in particular the DL methods for 3D building reconstruction for the purpose of city modelling using EO data. This is the first review with a focus on object model generation based on the DL methods and EO data. A brief overview of the recent building reconstruction studies with DL is also given. We have investigated the different DL architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and the combinations of conventional approaches with DL in this paper and reported their advantages and disadvantages. An outlook on the future developments of 3D building modelling based on DL is also presented.","[{""name"": ""M. Buyukdemircioglu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S.

Drawing on national survey data from just after the November election, we find Christian nationalism and perceptions of anti‐Christian discrimination are strong predictors that (1) Americans feel “religious freedom” was an important factor influencing their vote and (2) that they ranked it the single greatest factor influencing their vote. In contrast, the perception that LGT persons are not discriminated against also predicts viewing religious freedom as important, as does a perception of anti‐Semitism, but never perceptions of anti‐atheist or anti‐Muslim discrimination. Findings suggest conservative Christian supremacism, fear of (Judeo‐)Christian persecution and belief that LGT persons are privileged are ideological antecedents of votes for “religious freedom.”","[{""name"": ""Samuel L.

10.1111/ehr.13064,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Augmented human development in the age of globalization<SUP>†</SUP>,"AbstractA long‐run view of well‐being over the last one‐and‐a‐half centuries is presented using an Augmented Human Development Index (AHDI) that combines achievements in health, education, material living standards, and political freedom. The AHDI shows substantial gains in world human development since 1870, although significant room for improvement still remains. The AHDI spread unevenly until 1960, in absolute terms, and up to 1929 in relative ones, and reversed this trend thereafter. The main relative gain went to world countries’ middle class, but the main absolute gain accrued to the top decile. AHD trends and distribution do not match, but compare favourably with, those in per capita income. The absolute gap between present‐day advanced countries and the rest of the world deepened over time, though fell in relative terms. Life expectancy has led progress in AHD, particularly until 1970, and drove the catching‐up by the rest of the world during the epidemiological transition. Political and civil liberties took over thereafter.","[{""name"": ""Leandro Prados de la Escosura"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Social Sciences Universidad Carlos III, and the Centre for Economic Policy Research""]}]","[""10.1086/529000"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(01)00109-7"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-8314"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-59428-0.00012-6"", ""10.1080/14649880050008782"", ""10.1016/0022-0531(70)90039-6"", ""10.2307/2112627"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199662135.001.0001"", ""10.1162/qjec.121.1.73"", ""10.1257/app.2.2.1"", ""10.1080/00220388.2012.663907"", ""10.1111/1467-9361.00178"", ""10.1007/s10888-011-9190-3"", ""10.3386/w22306"", ""10.1111/roiw.12369"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00071"", ""10.1257/jep.20.3.97"", ""10.1257/app.2.2.72"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226146126.003.0002"", ""10.1353/dem.2005.0002"", ""10.2307/2234181"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(92)90141-H"", ""10.3386/w12735"", ""10.1515/9781400847969"", ""10.1016/0014-2921(91)90136-7"", ""10.1016/S0304-3878(02)00107-4"", ""10.1017/S1361491699000131"", ""10.1257/jep.26.3.137"", ""10.1111/roiw.12187"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511605390.003"", ""10.1007/s11205-015-1204-2"", ""10.1056/NEJM198007173030304"", ""10.4061/2011/261702"", ""10.3233/JEM-1995-21401"", ""10.1016/j.ehb.2010.03.001"", ""10.1080/19452829.2016.1200541"", ""10.1080/19452829.2011.645027"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(97)00034-X"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(91)90089-Z"", ""10.1257/app.2.2.118"", ""10.1257/aer.20110236"", ""10.1073/pnas.1011492107"", ""10.1016/0304-3878(93)90061-Q"", ""10.2307/1973733"", ""10.1007/s10888-011-9178-z"", ""10.1177/0022343318823866"", ""10.1007/s11205-017-1679-0"", ""10.1093/wber/lhv039"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510724"", ""10.3386/w22521"", ""10.1093/ajcn/72.1.241S"", ""10.1080/00324728.1962.10414870"", ""10.1080/00324728.1975.10412707"", ""10.2307/3349767"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04824-8"", ""10.31235/osf.io/du5g6"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02403.x"", ""10.1086/600102"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32130-X"", ""10.1080/19452829.2011.571077"", ""10.2307/3349375"", ""10.1111/roiw.12104"", ""10.1080/00324728.1975.10410201"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(96)00141-6"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-3243"", ""10.1093/wbro/lkr009"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2012.01.003"", ""10.2307/1972830"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316036495"", ""10.1016/S0921-8009(97)00168-7"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61690-0"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.oep.a041662"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511605390.004"", ""10.1080/00324728.1955.10405050"", ""10.1016/0304-4076(89)90082-1"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199944590.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s00355-013-0756-9"", ""10.1111/roiw.12235"", ""10.1111/roiw.12014""]","['Environmental Science', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['General Health Professions', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It has the traditional advantage that algorithms for branching bisimilarity are more efficient than ones for other weak behavioural equivalences, especially weak bisimilarity. With m the number of transitions and n the number of states, the classic $${O\left( {m n}\right) }$$ algorithm was recently replaced by an $$O({m (\log \left| { Act }\right| + \log n)})$$ algorithm [9], which is unfortunately rather complex. This paper combines its ideas with the ideas from Valmari [20], resulting in a simpler $$O({m \log n})$$ algorithm. Benchmarks show that in practice this algorithm is also faster and often far more memory efficient than its predecessors, making it the best option for branching bisimulation minimisation and preprocessing for calculating other weak equivalences on LTSs.","[{""name"": ""David N.

As a philanthropic initiative organized through a network of international cities, 100RC demonstrates how the spread of resilience thinking has been facilitated by exploiting changes in the structures and processes of global governance afforded by neoliberal globalization. The analysis focuses on explicating100RC’s animating logic of governance, which is committed to the cultivation of network connectivity. Rather than directly fostering resilience, connectivity is established as a condition under which resilience solutions can be immanently surfaced from the interactions of a diverse selection of stakeholders brought together through these networks. The article situates this governmental logic within broader changes associated with neoliberal globalization, namely the emergence of multi-scalar governance networks, the rise of philanthrocapitalism and the inception of platform capitalism. The conclusion discusses the implications of this analysis for further study of the relation between connectivity, danger, knowledge and value contained within resilience discourses.","[{""name"": ""Chris Zebrowski"", ""affiliation"": [""Loughborough University, UK""]}]","[""10.1177/0002764214550299"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12079"", ""10.1068/d140133"", ""10.1177/1474474017726556"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-27295-2_12"", ""10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00310.x"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2005.07.002"", ""10.4324/9781315773810"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195328721.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10021-001-0101-5"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12010"", ""10.1177/0305829816638166"", ""10.2218/finsoc.v3i1.1936"", ""10.1111/1467-8330.00252"", ""10.1080/02723638.2018.1446870"", ""10.1080/03085140902786611"", ""10.1002/9780470400791"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2003.11.007"", ""10.1177/1534484305285335"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2012.02.006"", ""10.1080/01436597.2014.868989"", ""10.2307/591464"", ""10.4159/9780674369542"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511549472"", ""10.1080/0969229032000048853"", ""10.1080/0955757042000203632"", ""10.1080/09654310120079797"", ""10.1177/0002764215591187"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-94860-4"", ""10.1177/0967010611399616"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.07.011"", ""10.5751/ES-05100-180122"", ""10.1177/0149206307305562"", ""10.1080/21693293.2013.804672"", ""10.1080/21693293.2016.1228158""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Strategy and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is a 14-channel imaging instrument operating on NASA’s Terra satellite since 1999. ASTER’s visible–near infrared (VNIR) instrument, with three bands and a 15 m Instantaneous field of view (IFOV), is accompanied by an additional VNIR band using a second, backward-looking telescope. Collecting along-track stereo pairs, the geometry produces a base-to-height ratio of 0.6. In 2009, the ASTER Science Team released Version 1 of the global DEM (GDEM) based on stereo correlation of 1.2 million ASTER scenes. The DEM has 1 arc-second latitude and longitude postings (∼30 m) and employed cloud masking to avoid cloud-contaminated pixels. The GDEM covers all of the Earth’s land surface from 83 degrees north to 83 degrees south latitude. Version 2 was released in 2011, with notable improvements in coverage and accuracy. In 2019, the final, Version 3, was released; again improving on coverage and removing almost all artifacts. Th GDEM is a unique, global high spatial resolution digital elevation dataset available to all users at no cost. In addition, a second unique dataset was produced and released. The raster-based ASTER Global Water Body Dataset (ASTWBD) identifies the presence of permanent water bodies, and marks them as ocean, lake, or river. An accompanying DEM file indicates the elevation for each water pixel. To date, over 110+ million 1×1 degree GDEM tiles have been distributed.","[{""name"": ""M.

Guided by a vision of a long-term integration of the Yugoslav economy into the international division of labor on the basis of equality and mutual interest, by the late 1970s the country’s foreign trade and hard currency revenue was boosted by a number of globally oriented corporate entities, some of which survived the demise of socialism and the dissolution of the country. These enterprises had a leading role as the country’s principal exporters and as the fulcrum of a web of economic contacts and exchanges between the Global South, Western Europe, and the Soviet Bloc. The article seeks to fill a historiographic gap by focusing on two major Yugoslav enterprises (Energoinvest and Pelagonija) that were based in the less-developed federal republics—Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. The article also investigates the transnational flow of ideas around the so-called “public enterprise,” its embeddedness in an interdependent global economy, and its visions for equitable development. Finally, the article explores these enterprises as enablers of social mobility and welfare, as well as spaces where issues of efficiency, planning, self-reliance, and self-management were negotiated.","[{""name"": ""Ljubica Spaskovska"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anna Calori"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/soeu-2017-0043"", ""10.1515/9783110534696-011"", ""10.2307/1191142"", ""10.1017/S0010417519000239"", ""10.1007/BF00161293"", ""10.1080/01436597.2014.970859"", ""10.1093/dh/dhv061"", ""10.1515/9780691219653"", ""10.1080/0023656X.2018.1429185"", ""10.1080/14631379308427759"", ""10.1016/0197-3975(84)90040-7""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Instead of focusing on equivalence of observations, like the $$L^{*}$$ L ∗ algorithm and its descendants, $$L^{\#}$$ L # takes a different perspective: it tries to establish apartness, a constructive form of inequality. $$L^{\#}$$ L # does not require auxiliary notions such as observation tables or discrimination trees, but operates directly on tree-shaped automata. $$L^{\#}$$ L # has the same asymptotic query and symbol complexities as the best existing learning algorithms, but we show that adaptive distinguishing sequences can be naturally integrated to boost the performance of $$L^{\#}$$ L # in practice. Experiments with a prototype implementation, written in Rust, suggest that $$L^{\#}$$ L # is competitive with existing algorithms.","[{""name"": ""Frits Vaandrager"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bharat Garhewal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jurriaan Rot"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thorsten Wißmann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-32759-9_4"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15375-4_6"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(91)90224-P"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96562-8_3"", ""10.1016/0890-5401(87)90052-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_23"", ""10.1007/s10270-020-00809-2"", ""10.1007/978-1-4613-3394-4_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-23021-4_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17127-8_4"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-31984-9_14"", ""10.1137/S009753979326091X"", ""10.1109/TC.1972.5009015"", ""10.1007/s00165-016-0355-5"", ""10.1007/BF01386390"", ""10.1145/360933.360975"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-67113-0_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41540-6_25"", ""10.1145/3092282.3092289"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2014.09.023"", ""10.46298/lmcs-17(3:15)2021"", ""10.1016/j.jss.2019.110426"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45231-5_31"", ""10.1007/BF01451605"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-34026-0_41"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96562-8_5"", ""10.1145/1868044.1868046"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11164-3_26"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3897.001.0001"", ""10.1109/12.272431"", ""10.1006/inco.1995.1070"", ""10.1007/s11334-005-0016-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15488-1_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-34781-8_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-34781-8_19"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009879"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-22348-9_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-67549-7_8"", ""10.1109/HASE.2014.46"", ""10.1007/s10009-009-0111-8"", ""10.1145/73007.73047"", ""10.1006/inco.1993.1021"", ""10.1145/3434642"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-33693-0_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-05089-3_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-25423-4_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-77313-1_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-30000-9_14"", ""10.1093/comjnl/bxz056"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139168717"", ""10.1145/3373718.3394775"", ""10.1145/2967606."", ""10.1007/978-3-030-68195-1_13""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Computer Networks and Communications', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1093/shm/hkz018,SOCIAL HISTORY OF MEDICINE,0603 World History; 0712 History of Science and Technology,'Problems of Today and Tomorrow': Prevention and the National Health Service in the 1970s,"Summary A consensus developed around prevention in the early 1970s as a response to epidemiological studies that had highlighted smoking, diet and physical inactivity as risk factors for chronic disease, especially heart disease. This reaction was catalysed by the financial pressures the National Health Service (NHS) was experiencing, the 1974 reorganisation of the service and international awareness of the Lalonde report. Such widespread interest resulted in three different but contemporaneous reports on prevention in 1976 and 1977. All three emphasised, to varying degrees, personal responsibility and lifestyle as important tenets of prevention. This article focuses on Prevention and Health: Everybody’s Business, a 1976 discussion paper published by the four governments of the UK, to explore this preoccupation with disease prevention throughout the decade, and what it reveals about public health in Britain, political attitudes to the NHS and the changing relationship between citizenship and the welfare state.","[{""name"": ""Peder Clark"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Pharmacy', 'History']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1007 药学', 0.7325), ('1008 中药学', 0.7122)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

This article explores how this contradiction was exposed and challenged by some of the health service’s own workforce, who witnessed and contested racism in the National Health Service (NHS). This is discussed through the lens of the treatment of sickle cell anaemia (SCA), a genetic trait and disease more common in people of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean descent, which has been highly racialized as affecting black people in particular. By pushing for improved responses to pain in sickle cell disease, and demonstrating the need for SCA screening in urban areas, healthcare professionals within the NHS—many of whom were black or migrant nurses, health visitors or doctors—articulated the status and entitlements of Black British citizenship.","[{""name"": ""Grace Redhead"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of History, University of Warwick, UK""]}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

A View Through High-Frequency Data,"An economic downturn coincided with the start of the epidemic but the recession was short and moderate, compared with that of 1920/21. Cross-sectional high-frequency data indicate that the epidemic affected the labor supply sharply but briefly with no ensuing spill-overs; most of the recession, brief as it was, was due to the end of the war. I analyze weekly city-level mortality data and economic indicators with time series methods and structural estimation of an economic-epidemiological model: interventions to hinder the contagion reduced mortality at little economic cost, probably because reduced infections mitigated the impact on the labor force.","[{""name"": ""François R.

Although developed as an academic concept, it played, at the same time, a crucial political and ideological role, thus holding a very powerful and potentially toxic ideological burden, chiefly consisting of the idea that Spain is a nation shaped against Islam. Its dual academic and ideological nature makes it a highly problematic concept that greatly contributed to produce a largely biased and distorted vision of the Iberian medieval past, aimed at delegitimizing the Islamic presence (al-Andalus) and therefore at legitimizing the Christian conquest of the Muslim territory. Over the last years and in the framework of the Clash of Civilizations doctrine, conservative and far-right scholarly and political outlets reignited the most ideological version of the Reconquista, thus raising a major challenge for academic historians.","[{""name"": ""Alejandro García Sanjuán"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Classics', 'Religious studies', 'Archeology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6825), ('0602 中国史', 0.6817)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)]]"

The ethnographic focus is a telecommunications company called M-Switch located in the Parisian neighborhood of le Sentier, the trajectory of which is part of a broader cultural and economic shift observable in the neighborhood from industry to new technologies. This particular company is a privileged site for witnessing how people work with and across religious differences between Maghrebi Jews and Muslims in France. The ethnography looks at how contemporary, non-nostalgic reconceptualizations of the past are utilized to negotiate an ethnically plural and potentially convivial present. Relationships within the company have a Maghrebi center made up of shared cultural memories, economic interdependency, and changing gender and class relations.

Numerous features and configuration options in the hardware and the software environment that are relevant for performance are not even known to most application users or developers. Microbenchmarks, i.e., simple codes that fathom a particular aspect of the hardware, can help to shed light on such issues, but only if they are well understood and if the results can be reconciled with known facts or performance models. The insight gained from microbenchmarks may then be applied to real applications for performance analysis or optimization. In this paper we investigate two modern Intel x86 server CPU architectures in depth: Broadwell EP and Cascade Lake SP. We highlight relevant hardware configuration settings that can have a decisive impact on code performance and show how to properly measure on-chip and off-chip data transfer bandwidths. The new victim L3 cache of Cascade Lake and its advanced replacement policy receive due attention. Finally we use DGEMM, sparse matrix-vector multiplication, and the HPCG benchmark to make a connection to relevant application scenarios.","[{""name"": ""Christie L.

No competitive nativist party has recently emerged in federal politics that challenges the mainstream consensus around mass immigration, unlike virtually every other postindustrial democracy. This paper argues that existing explanations for this “exceptionalism” are lacking. In particular, they fail to appreciate the importance of Quebec nationalism in contributing to this outcome. Quebec nationalism fractured the stronger anti‐immigration sentiment found in rural and smaller urban areas in both Quebec and Anglophone Canada and thereby prevented right‐wing parties from mobilising that sentiment in a way that could feasibly win elections. This forced such parties to moderate their message and court “ethnic voters” in suburban ridings around Toronto and Vancouver. We illustrate this argument using novel data which permit a comparison of the Canadian experience with nativist politics in Australia and New Zealand.","[{""name"": ""Joshua Gordon"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Public Policy Simon Fraser University  Vancouver British Columbia Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Sanjay Jeram"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Simon Fraser University  Burnaby British Columbia Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Clifton van der Linden"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science McMaster University  Hamilton Ontario Canada""]}]","[""10.1080/13537113.2015.1032033"", ""10.1002/j.1839-4655.2003.tb01141.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000165"", ""10.1017/S0008423911000746"", ""10.1080/00313220008559135"", ""10.1515/9780773575387"", ""10.2307/2547729"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510113"", ""10.1017/S0007123403220226"", ""10.1017/S1049096517000476"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2818659"", ""10.59962/9780774836098"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139195034"", ""10.1080/01402380701617563"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139152365.004"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00015"", ""10.3138/9781442666313-009"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1787/9789264010307-en"", ""10.1080/01402380802234631"", ""10.1177/019791839502900308"", ""10.3386/w23559"", ""10.1080/0140238042000228103"", ""10.1080/14662043.2012.692922"", ""10.3138/9781442674677-011"", ""10.1515/9780773564237"", ""10.59962/9780774815680"", ""10.1080/17457289.2016.1268144""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Understanding the relationship between IR 4.0 skills and career adaptability offers valuable insights for academia and policymakers on formulating strategies and action plans to continually update Emirati students' transferable skills. It is also crucial for long-term success in human capital sustainability under the Emiratization policy.Originality/valueThis study is a preliminary step toward clarifying the complex mechanism through which career adaptability relates to career outcomes and sustaining employability. Concentrating on UAE undergraduates, this study elucidates the relationship between employability skills and career adaptability, and advocates more research employing boundary conditions that might limit their effects on adapting behaviors.","[{""name"": ""Khalizani Khalid"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdul Majeed Ahmad"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/01443330810900202"", ""10.1108/17537980810890301"", ""10.1108/EJTD-07-2016-0049"", ""10.1177/135910457000100301"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2018.02.001"", ""10.1108/JMD-01-2016-0013"", ""10.1108/00400910710754435"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2013.01.009"", ""10.1108/CDI-04-2015-0051"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-02-2015-0006"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-09-2019-0111"", ""10.1108/CDI-06-2017-0093"", ""10.1108/ET-08-2018-0186"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-12-2017-0102"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2020.103414"", ""10.1108/ET-12-2018-0258"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-05-2016-0028"", ""10.1108/HEED-08-2019-0039"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2016.01.004"", ""10.1108/ET-10-2018-0206"", ""10.1108/S1534-085620180000019006"", ""10.1016/j.accinf.2019.100432"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2014.03.006"", ""10.1108/IJM-10-2018-0334"", ""10.1108/EJTD-10-2019-0181"", ""10.1007/978-1-4613-8309-3_6"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-12-2017-0103"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-10-2019-0131"", ""10.1108/OTH-08-2017-0072"", ""10.1177/0013164413498257"", ""10.1016/j.tmp.2019.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2012.01.011"", ""10.1108/JOEPP-03-2014-0011"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2012.01.008"", ""10.1108/ET-07-2018-0154"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.02039"", ""10.1108/ET-01-2015-0007"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2015.11.013"", ""10.1108/CDI-05-2018-0135""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Using descriptive statistics and network analysis, we reconstruct the complete network of linkages between agents involved in the origination and distribution of these bills. Our analysis reveals the truly global nature of the London bill market before the First World War and underscores the crucial role played by London intermediaries (acceptors and discounters) in overcoming information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders on this market.

Based on a unique dataset gathered from the records of the training ship Indefatigable, this study analyses the mean heights of boys at admission and their longitudinal growth using regressions that control for observable characteristics. Our findings show a secular increase in boys’ mean height over time, and that height gain was most rapid during the interwar period. In addition, longitudinal growth velocity was low and similar at different ages for boys born before the 1910s, suggesting a substantially weaker pubertal growth spurt (three standard deviations lower) than that which occurs in modern populations. However, for boys born in the 1910s and later, higher growth velocities associated with pubertal growth appeared in a narrow range of ages (14 to 16 years). Thus, it appears that there was a substantial change in the growth pattern beginning in the 1910s with the emergence of a strong pubertal growth spurt. The timing of this shift implies that declines in child morbidity mattered more for the changing growth pattern than improvements in nutrition that occurred before 1910.","[{""name"": ""Pei Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""New York University Shanghai""]}, {""name"": ""Eric B.

10.1108/HESWBL-04-2020-0071,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,The best practice in work-integrated pedagogy for degree apprenticeships in a post-viral future,"PurposeThis article draws on a study of best practices in work-integrated learning (WIL) identified in the Middlesex University Degree Apprenticeships Development Fund (DADF) Project, which examined their application for four public sector degree apprenticeships (DAs). The authors suggest that WIL pedagogical practices deployed to deliver DAs can bridge traditional pedagogical and occupational divisions while building institutional resilience in a post-viral world. The paper is intended to contribute to both practitioner and policy-level discourse regarding the best practice in WIL for DAs.Design/methodology/approachA literature review of key texts was used to identify “success characteristics” in WIL “signature” pedagogies, with potential applicability for DA design and delivery. These characteristics were used to frame interrogation of best pedagogical practices, using the best practice matrix developed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with selected expert practitioners to examine their matrix responses and to discuss the researcher's initial “read-across” analysis of best practices and possible implications for pedagogical practice in WIL for DAs across other sectors. This paper also draws on feedback from employer groups who were consulted on the project report recommendations and further feedback from a national project dissemination conference in 2018. The findings from the research project have also been re-evaluated with reference to further literature in the context of the challenges presented by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).FindingsThe findings from the study indicate that pedagogical best practices were to a significant degree transferable across professions and sectors; success characteristics in one pedagogical area (for example, mentoring/practice education) underpin success in another (recognition of prior learning [RPL] and practice-based assessment of achievement); success characteristics in WIL can also be applied and operated across professions and sectors to demonstrate how the best practice in WIL should be applied in the design of DAs more generally.Research limitations/implicationsThe original project research study focussed on WIL pedagogical practices in four specified professions across four public sectors within one institution. This approach, though limited, enabled the research study to focus on in-depth qualitative interactions with practitioners from different sectors rather than institutional differences. As a consequence, the research study was able to focus on in-depth and dynamic interrelationships in pedagogical practice from the perspective of the professions, which facilitated productive examination of similarities and differences across these professions.Originality/valueThe research study provided evidence of the potential value of a more explicit recognition of WIL practice in the higher education sector and how consistent approaches to WIL should inform programme design. This has potential to improve the quality of curriculum design and pedagogy across DA programmes and provide a valuable reference point for quality assuring this provision.","[{""name"": ""Finbar Lillis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Darryll Bravenboer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/20423891211271773"", ""10.1108/ET-10-2015-0091"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-8856-8.ch008"", ""10.1108/JWAM-01-2017-0002"", ""10.1080/0309877X.2012.699516"", ""10.1108/13665621111174889"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-05-2020-0104"", ""10.1080/03075070903216635"", ""10.1080/03075070802528296"", ""10.1080/02602938.2013.792106"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-04-2020-0074"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2009.12.012"", ""10.1080/13636820400200265"", ""10.1162/0011526054622015""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1093/ahr/rhab195,AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,"The Unexceptional State: Rethinking the State in the Nineteenth Century (France, United States)","Abstract In the past thirty years, historians have deeply renewed our understanding of the state in the early republic period of the United States as much more powerful, deep reaching, and proactive than the traditional image represented. In France, too, new work has revised our vision of the state in the early nineteenth century, which looked different from the triumphant, Napoleonic leviathan that often appears in discourse. Yet both historiographies, having evolved separately, still base their conclusion on implicit comparisons, with an imagined “European” state or with a later “modern” state. This article uses the new historiographies on both countries to go beyond those unstated exceptionalisms to propose a reconstruction of the state in that period. Pulling those studies together, and mobilizing insights from one to shed light on the other, it recovers a common repertoire of statecraft that emerged in the revolutionary era. It hinged on fostering consent of key segments of the population and therefore organized the work of the state in mostly nonbureaucratic forms. States in that period reflected a particular enmeshing of public and private forms that needs to be analyzed for itself, especially if we want to understand the specificity of today’s practices.","[{""name"": ""Nicolas Barreyre"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Claire Lemercier"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'History']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

Data show that this unit contains remnants of a Mesoproterozoic granite (Dobra Gneiss Type A), early Neoproterozoic sediments (paragneiss, marble) and late Neoproterozoic volcanic-arc granitoids from the Avalonian–Cadomian peri-Gondwana Orogen (Dobra Gneiss Type B, Spitz Gneiss). A rock association of such old age is extraordinary in the Variscan Orogen. We interpret that these rocks were originally part of the Brunovistulian foreland plate (i.e. part of Avalonian Europe and the Devonian Old Red Continent, respectively) before being tectonically incorporated into the eastern flank of the Variscan Orogen. This interpretation is considered likely because the Dobra Gneiss Type B turned out to be extremely similar, geochemically and in age, to the Bittesch Gneiss in the Moravian Zone, which is generally accepted as a Brunovistulian (i.e. Avalonian) rock. Based on the zircon ages measured in ortho- and paragneiss samples, the Drosendorf Unit can be excellently correlated with West Amazonia. This supports the long-standing idea that Avalonian Europe contains terranes of Amazonian ancestry. A model is presented to show how West Amazonian rocks could have been transferred to Europe in the Early Paleozoic.","[{""name"": ""Martin Lindner"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry and Physics of Materials, University of Salzburg, Jakob-Haringer-Straße 2a, 5020 Salzburg, Austria""]}, {""name"": ""Wolfgang Dörr"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut für Geowissenschaften, Goethe-Universität, Altenhöferallee 1, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel Reither"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry and Physics of Materials, University of Salzburg, Jakob-Haringer-Straße 2a, 5020 Salzburg, Austria""]}, {""name"": ""Fritz Finger"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry and Physics of Materials, University of Salzburg, Jakob-Haringer-Straße 2a, 5020 Salzburg, Austria""]}]","[""10.1016/j.precamres.2010.08.010"", ""10.2478/v10096-011-0023-x"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.2002.201.01.02"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-42148-7.50008-3"", ""10.1144/GSL.MEM.2006.032.01.05"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1314.2000.00273.x"", ""10.1130/2007.1200(14)"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(92)90132-P"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2014.12.015"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00963-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-77518-5_42"", ""10.1016/0301-9268(89)90042-9"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.2000.179.01.08"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.2000.179.01.05"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2008.07.025"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(2000)28<1035:DTAOTS>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1007/s00531-004-0420-9"", ""10.1007/BF00212416"", ""10.1093/petrology/42.11.2033"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2019.103669"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2015.11.020"", ""10.2343/geochemj.29.91"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2004.06.017"", ""10.1093/petrology/egl013"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2009.09.011"", ""10.1007/s00531-007-0183-1"", ""10.12789/geocanj.2014.41.039"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2008.01.012"", ""10.1080/00206814.2010.543783"", ""10.1144/jgs2013-059"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2013.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2007.04.021"", ""10.1007/BF00402106"", ""10.3190/jgeosci.271"", ""10.1144/CEV1P.3"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2008.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.02.007"", ""10.5327/Z1519-874X2009000200005"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1989)017<0735:MFTEOT>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00070-3"", ""10.1144/0016-764903-064"", ""10.4138/1608"", ""10.1130/GSATG24A.1"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1994)022<0617:CBISAT>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1016/0301-9268(91)90005-U"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(02)00187-7"", ""10.1144/SP297.17"", ""10.1144/SP327.12"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2009.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.gsf.2011.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2012.12.026"", ""10.1144/0016-764903-083"", ""10.1144/0016-76492006-023"", ""10.1007/BF00212415"", ""10.1007/s005310050019"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030<0039:ROTCMI>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1093/petrology/25.4.956"", ""10.1007/BF00384745"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(99)00235-8"", ""10.1007/BF00381441"", ""10.1007/s00710-016-0427-5"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-0666-1"", ""10.1007/BF01828768"", ""10.1093/petrology/egt015"", ""10.1007/s00531-016-1416-y"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(75)90088-6"", ""10.1017/S0016756818000031"", ""10.1144/0016-76492006-014"", ""10.1007/BF01820841"", ""10.1080/11035892609455322"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.1989.042.01.19"", ""10.1007/s005310050165"", ""10.18814/epiiugs/1999/v22i3/004"", ""10.1007/s00531-009-0498-1"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(00)00312-5"", ""10.1016/j.gsf.2018.04.001"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(03)00015-5"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2017.02.002"", ""10.1111/j.1751-908X.1995.tb00147.x"", ""10.1144/jgs2012-152"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(02)00344-X"", ""10.1144/GSL.MEM.2006.032.01.19"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(86)90236-2"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2013.11.010"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2014.06.011""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],"['Geophysics', 'Geochemistry and Petrology']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)], [('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.7485), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7296)]]"

Scholars taking this approach have explored distinctive genres of steles to transform our understanding of north China under Mongol rule. Through a case study, I show how a set of steles installed in the fifteenth-century rural world of north China transmitted authority and power not just through the content of their inscriptions but also through other written and unwritten information they stored.

10.1093/pastj/gtaa027,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,"THE RISE OF THE PARISH WELFARE STATE IN ENGLAND, c.1600-1800","Abstract: The world’s first nationwide, publicly funded welfare system emerged and solidified in England over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Its influence on society and economy during this period was profound, but this article is the first attempt to determine the scale of its impact by examining the amount of money annually spent on relief across the whole period. Drawing on data from 184 widely dispersed parishes over more than two centuries and a new estimate for spending in c.1600, it shows that poor relief experienced alternating phases of rapid expansion, relative stability and occasionally outright retrenchment. Levels of redistribution were pushed higher by both ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ factors. Specifically, trends in relief spending are compared to other indices such as population, economic expansion, central government revenues, labourers’ wages and inflation to show how the growth of poor relief related to wider demographic and economic changes. Such comparisons make it possible to think more clearly about causation: how much of the growth in spending can be attributed to such developments? While law, demography, inflation and other well-attested factors certainly contributed to the rise of this early modern welfare system, the poor themselves may well have played an important role.","[{""name"": ""Brodie Waddell"", ""affiliation"": [""Birkbeck, University of London""]}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

This article explores the sensory history of the revolution through ego-documents like diaries and memoirs. It tracks in detail how people of various backgrounds in Petrograd and Moscow lived the olfactory class struggles after February and the taste excesses of the post-October “wine pogroms,” how they expressed a new experience of time in a sensory idiom, and how they ultimately became habituated to the new sounds and sights of revolutionary Russia. Historiography is at a propitious moment to move beyond a dichotomy of discourse versus “raw” experience: conjoining the histories of experience, the senses, and the emotions, the article probes what is to be gained from interpreting a world-historical event with a concept of experience as an integrated, multimodal, simultaneous sensory-emotional-cognitive process. Avant-garde artists, contemporaries of the Russian Revolution, foreshadowed such a holistic concept of experience by a century.","[{""name"": ""Jan Plamper"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Between the 1780s and 1820s, a safety revolution occurred that saw shipping losses and insurance rates on oceanic routes almost halved thanks to steady improvements in shipbuilding and navigation. Copper sheathing, iron reinforcing, and flush decks were the major innovations in shipbuilding. Navigation improved, not through chronometers, which remained too expensive and unreliable for general use, but through radically improved charts, accessible manuals of basic navigational techniques, and improved shore-based navigational aids.“Curse thee, thou quadrant!” dashing it to the deck, “no longer will I guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship’s compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by log and by line; these shall conduct me, and show me my place on the sea.”Captain Ahab inMoby Dick,Ch.

Despite recent progress in developing verification methods for specifications such as local adversarial robustness in deep neural networks (DNNs) in terms of scalability, precision, and applicability to different network architectures, layers, and activation functions, robustness verification of semantic segmentation has not yet been considered. We address this limitation by developing and applying new robustness analysis methods for several segmentation neural network architectures, specifically by addressing reachability analysis of up-sampling layers, such as transposed convolution and dilated convolution. We consider several definitions of robustness for segmentation, such as the percentage of pixels in the output that can be proven robust under different adversarial perturbations, and a robust variant of intersection-over-union (IoU), the typical performance evaluation measure for segmentation tasks. Our approach is based on a new relaxed reachability method, allowing users to select the percentage of a number of linear programming problems (LPs) to solve when constructing the reachable set, through a relaxation factor percentage. The approach is implemented within NNV, then applied and evaluated on segmentation datasets, such as a multi-digit variant of MNIST known as M2NIST. Thorough experiments show that by using transposed convolution for up-sampling and average-pooling for down-sampling, combined with minimizing the number of ReLU layers in the SSNs, we can obtain SSNs with not only high accuracy (IoU), but also that are more robust to adversarial attacks and amenable to verification. Additionally, using our new relaxed reachability method, we can significantly reduce the verification time for neural networks whose ReLU layers dominate the total analysis time, even in classification tasks.","[{""name"": ""Hoang-Dung Tran"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Neelanjana Pal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Patrick Musau"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Diego Manzanas Lopez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nathaniel Hamilton"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiaodong Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stanley Bak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Taylor T.

Particular attention is given to Hebrew translations produced by members of the Jewish religious elite during the long eighteenth century, which have hitherto been viewed as original Jewish works. The article argues that translation was perfectly suited to the combination of attraction and anxiety with which many early modern Jews, particularly members of the Jewish religious elite, observed the cultural developments of their time. These authors acknowledged (what they viewed as) their own cultural inferiority, but feared the potential hazards of direct exposure to non-Jewish texts and ideas. Jewish translators thus became cultural gatekeepers rather than passive recipients of non-Jewish culture. They mistranslated both deliberately and accidentally, added and omitted, gave new meanings to texts and ideas, and harnessed their sources to meet their own agendas. The works of these translators reveal a form of cultural transfer that relied on the mindful adaptation and reformulation of new ideas by discreet, almost inadvertent innovators.","[{""name"": ""Iris Idelson-Shein"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we generated synthetic 2D echocardiograms and trained a neural network for segmenting the left ventricle and left atrium. The performance of the network trained on exclusively synthetic images was evaluated on an unseen dataset of real images and yielded mean Dice scores of $$88.6 \pm 4.91$$ 88.6 ± 4.91 , $$91.9 \pm 4.22$$ 91.9 ± 4.22 , $$85.2 \pm 4.83$$ 85.2 ± 4.83 % for left ventricular endocardium, epicardium and left atrial segmentation respectively. This represents a relative increase of 9.2, 3.3 and 13.9% in Dice scores compared to the previous state-of-the-art. The proposed pipeline has potential for application to a wide range of other tasks across various medical imaging modalities.","[{""name"": ""David Stojanovski"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Uxio Hermida"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pablo Lamata"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Arian Beqiri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alberto Gomez"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.23919/EUSIPCO.2019.8902799"", ""10.1111/echo.12832"", ""10.1109/TMI.2021.3051806"", ""10.1109/TMI.2019.2900516"", ""10.1038/s41586-020-2145-8"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-18576-2_12"", ""10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008851"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-16902-1_9"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.244""]",['Computer Science'],['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)]]"

Despite its wide adoption, its potential applicability beyond relational databases was swiftly explored. As a result, several extensions and new mapping languages were proposed to tackle the limitations that surfaced as R2RML was applied in real-world use cases. Over the years, one of these languages, the RDF Mapping Language (RML), has gathered a large community of contributors, users, and compliant tools. So far, there has been no well-defined set of features for the mapping language, nor was there a consensus-marking ontology. Consequently, it has become challenging for non-experts to fully comprehend and utilize the full range of the language’s capabilities. After three years of work, the W3C Community Group on Knowledge Graph Construction proposes a new specification for RML. This paper presents the new modular RML ontology and the accompanying SHACL shapes that complement the specification. We discuss the motivations and challenges that emerged when extending R2RML, the methodology we followed to design the new ontology while ensuring its backward compatibility with R2RML, and the novel features which increase its expressiveness. The new ontology consolidates the potential of RML, empowers practitioners to define mapping rules for constructing RDF graphs that were previously unattainable, and allows developers to implement systems in adherence with [R2]RML.Resource type: Ontology/License: CC BY 4.0 InternationalDOI: 10.5281/zenodo.7918478/URL: http://w3id.org/rml/portal/","[{""name"": ""Ana Iglesias-Molina"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dylan Van Assche"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julián Arenas-Guerrero"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ben De Meester"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christophe Debruyne"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Samaneh Jozashoori"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pano Maria"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Franck Michel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Chaves-Fraga"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anastasia Dimou"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3233/SW-223294"", ""10.3233/SW-223135"", ""10.1145/3555312"", ""10.1109/COINS54846.2022.9854999"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7907172"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-33246-4_43"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7898764"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2020.100596"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-06981-9_20"", ""10.1145/3366424.3383528"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-47602-5_10"", ""10.1016/j.future.2019.10.006"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7919856"", ""10.1145/3442442.3458608"", ""10.3390/app112411932"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-67008-9_42"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7919852"", ""10.1145/2814864.2814873"", ""10.7717/peerj-cs.318"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68204-4_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-19433-7_43"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98192-5_40"", ""10.1145/3340531.3412881"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7918478"", ""10.3233/sw-223224"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7919845"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-62419-4_16"", ""10.1145/3011141.3011152"", ""10.1609/aimag.v36i1.2565"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2018.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.ejsobi.2023.103497"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-58068-5_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59833-4_6"", ""10.3233/SSW210045"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-67008-9_55"", ""10.5220/0005448304430454"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-62466-8_19"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7749949"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-17105-5_11"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2022.104755"", ""10.4018/ijswis.2014040102"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-88361-4_38"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2022.100760"", ""10.3233/SW-210442"", ""10.14778/3551793.3551818"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2022.100753"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-74296-6_26"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7919848"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7919850"", ""10.1145/3269206.3274275"", ""10.1145/3360901.3364449""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']","['Molecular Biology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

NNV is a formal verification software tool for deep learning models and cyber-physical systems with neural network components. NNV was first introduced as a verification framework for feedforward and convolutional neural networks, as well as for neural network control systems. Since then, numerous works have made significant improvements in the verification of new deep learning models, as well as tackling some of the scalability issues that may arise when verifying complex models. In this new version of NNV, we introduce verification support for multiple deep learning models, including neural ordinary differential equations, semantic segmentation networks and recurrent neural networks, as well as a collection of reachability methods that aim to reduce the computation cost of reachability analysis of complex neural networks. We have also added direct support for standard input verification formats in the community such as VNNLIB (verification properties), and ONNX (neural networks) formats. We present a collection of experiments in which NNV verifies safety and robustness properties of feedforward, convolutional, semantic segmentation and recurrent neural networks, as well as neural ordinary differential equations and neural network control systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of NNV against a commercially available product in a collection of benchmarks from control systems, semantic segmentation, image classification, and time-series data.","[{""name"": ""Diego Manzanas Lopez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sung Woo Choi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hoang-Dung Tran"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Taylor T.

Ranking supermartingales (RSMs) prove that probabilistic programs halt, in expectation, within a finite number of steps. While previously RSMs were directly synthesised from source code, our method learns them from sampled execution traces. We introduce theneural ranking supermartingale: we let a neural network fit an RSM over execution traces and then we verify it over the source code using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT); if the latter step produces a counterexample, we generate from it new sample traces and repeat learning in a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis loop, until the SMT solver confirms the validity of the RSM. The result is thus a sound witness of probabilistic termination. Our learning strategy is agnostic to the source code and its verification counterpart supports the widest range of probabilistic single-loop programs that any existing tool can handle to date. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method over a range of benchmarks that include linear and polynomial programs with discrete, continuous, state-dependent, multi-variate, hierarchical distributions, and distributions with undefined moments.","[{""name"": ""Alessandro Abate"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mirco Giacobbe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Diptarko Roy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/LCSYS.2020.3005328"", ""10.1145/3158122"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15769-1_8"", ""10.1109/FMCAD.2013.6679385"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2019.102338"", ""10.1145/3428240"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89884-1_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-32033-3_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_15"", ""10.1017/9781108770750.008"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_1"", ""10.1145/3174800"", ""10.1145/3093333.3009873"", ""10.1017/9781108770750.002"", ""10.1145/2775051.2677001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-11245-5_22"", ""10.1145/3554332"", ""10.1145/2593882.2593900"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_53"", ""10.1145/3360555"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31365-3_27"", ""10.1007/s00236-018-0321-1"", ""10.1145/2562059.2562139"", ""10.1016/0022-0000(81)90036-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_4"", ""10.1145/3428257"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31424-7_12"", ""10.1145/3371084"", ""10.1145/3158123"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41540-6_7"", ""10.1145/1059816.1059824"", ""10.1145/3158121"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72016-2_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72019-3_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1145/3296979.3192394"", ""10.1145/2491411.2491413"", ""10.1145/1168917.1168907"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_4""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"
10.1017/S147924432200052X,MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Informal Empire: The Origin and Significance of a Key Term,"Ever since the publication of “The Imperialism of Free Trade” by John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson in 1953, “informal empire” has been a key term for historians. It has, however, always been contentious. The central issue was whether imperial historians were prepared to accept a new concept of empire. This article explains the paradox of informal empire by creating a stronger provenance for the term. Since the early nineteenth century, imperial metaphors have been used to characterize Britain's position in the world economy. Gallagher and Robinson—like their immediate predecessors, Charles Fay and Keith Hancock—wanted to understand British imperialism in the broader context of European expansion while also formulating an alternative to the radical liberal and neo-Marxist interpretations widely current after World War I. Ultimately, the difficulty of using “empire” as a single category led Gallagher and one of his most influential successors to choose an alternative term.","[{""name"": ""Bernard Attard"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/03086534.2017.1332132"", ""10.1086/ahr.117.3.772"", ""10.1093/past/73.1.100"", ""10.1080/03086534.2019.1677341"", ""10.1353/book.75905"", ""10.1525/9780520938618"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198204237.001.0001"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtz021"", ""10.1080/03086534.2018.1431433"", ""10.1080/03086534.2019.1677337"", ""10.1080/03086534.2018.1438965"", ""10.1017/S0022216X00023440"", ""10.1017/S1740022807002343"", ""10.1080/03086537308582369"", ""10.2307/2590147"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511760495"", ""10.1080/03086539008582819"", ""10.4324/9781315677798"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511523847"", ""10.1080/14490854.2016.1156115"", ""10.1515/9781400834709"", ""10.2307/2591017"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511635526""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

There have been many such theories in recent years which equip a type theory with quantitative dataflow tracking, usually via a semiring-like structure which provides analysis on variables (often called ‘quantitative’ or ‘coeffect’ theories). We present Graded Modal Dependent Type Theory (Grttfor short), which equips a dependent type theory with a general, parameterizable analysis of the flow of data, both in and between computational terms and types. In this theory, it is possible to study, restrict, and reason about data use in programs and types, enabling, for example, parametric quantifiers and linearity to be captured in a dependent setting. We proposeGrtt, study its metatheory, and explore various case studies of its use in reasoning about programs and studying other type theories. We have implemented the theory and highlight the interesting details, including showing an application of grading to optimising the type checking procedure itself.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Moon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Harley Eades III"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dominic Orchard"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/292540.292555"", ""10.1145/3408972"", ""10.2168/LMCS-8(1:29)2012"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.TYPES.2017.1"", ""10.1145/3209108.3209189"", ""10.1145/2535838.2535852"", ""10.1145/3158093"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24849-1_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_19"", ""10.1145/6041.6042"", ""10.1109/LICS.1996.561339"", ""10.1145/3434331"", ""10.1109/LICS.2011.22"", ""10.1145/2746325.2746335"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-85373-2_12"", ""10.1145/3290322"", ""10.1145/964001.964025"", ""10.1145/2429069.2429113"", ""10.1145/2951913.2951939"", ""10.1007/3-540-60579-7_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_18"", ""10.1016/S0049-237X(08)70843-7"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(87)90045-4"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(92)90386-T"", ""10.1145/3341711"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1104.003.0005"", ""10.1006/inco.1994.1036"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511526619.004"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.292.4"", ""10.1145/2535838.2535846"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.CSL.2013.432"", ""10.1145/2775051.2676969"", ""10.1016/0890-5401(91)90053-5"", ""10.1016/S0049-237X(08)71945-1"", ""10.1016/S0049-237X(09)70189-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-30936-1_12"", ""10.1145/3110276"", ""10.1145/3341714"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198501275.003.0012"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39212-2_35"", ""10.1145/2628136.2628160"", ""10.1109/LICS.2001.932499"", ""10.1007/10930755_16"", ""10.1007/3-540-06859-7_148"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2012.09.005"", ""10.1006/inco.1996.2613"", ""10.1145/1926385.1926436"", ""10.1145/99370.99404"", ""10.1145/2699407"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1104.003.0003"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-78089-0_9""]",['Computer Science'],"['Hardware and Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

It focuses on the Board of Trade's dispatch of “Instructions” and “Queries” to governors in the American colonies, arguing that it was through the circulation of these documents and the use of archives that the board sought to enforce constitutional norms of bureaucratic conduct and the authority of central institutions of imperial administration. In the absence of a singular, codified written constitution, the British state relied upon a variety of different kinds of documents to forge the imperial Atlantic into a governed space. The article concludes by pointing to the continuing centrality of documents and archives to the bureaucratic manifestation of the imperial constitution in the immediate aftermath of the American Revolution.","[{""name"": ""Asheesh Kapur Siddique"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/698925"", ""10.33137/cal.v1i1.21057"", ""10.1017/9780511812552"", ""10.2307/1835665"", ""10.1017/S0018246X1700022X"", ""10.4159/9780674972780"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199640355.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-09851-1"", ""10.1057/9780230339675"", ""10.9783/9780812201758"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316273227"", ""10.9783/9780812201215"", ""10.1017/S0018246X1000021X"", ""10.1086/383353"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226675183.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1919127"", ""10.1007/BF02435632"", ""10.2307/1920836"", ""10.1111/j.1747-4469.2001.tb00181.x"", ""10.2307/2865342"", ""10.2307/1952788"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511819766"", ""10.1017/S002187580001313X"", ""10.4159/9780674736030"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139096744.008"", ""10.2307/2936901"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107360297"", ""10.7560/709812"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtw033"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921599"", ""10.1017/S0738248013000801"", ""10.1093/past/184.1.33"", ""10.1007/s10502-010-9128-8"", ""10.1086/669774"", ""10.1057/9780230603653_3"", ""10.4159/9780674985995"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtu003"", ""10.7312/russ94110"", ""10.1007/s10502-010-9122-1"", ""10.2307/1918542"", ""10.3998/mpub.9394529"", ""10.1080/00033799700200211"", ""10.7312/cock94056"", ""10.1353/book.98245"", ""10.4324/9781315840376-4"", ""10.3138/9781487579715"", ""10.2307/1918518"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2281.1996.tb01840.x"", ""10.1093/ehr/LIV.CCXIII.38"", ""10.5325/j.ctv14gpfx3"", ""10.1093/jsh/shr136"", ""10.2307/1915650"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511802836"", ""10.1215/9780822391616"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtx029"", ""10.1515/9781400858750"", ""10.1017/9781316676776"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2281.1989.tb00517.x"", ""10.1080/03086538708582732"", ""10.9783/9780812292251"", ""10.1163/15700658-12342604"", ""10.2307/1832836""]","['Social Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Anthropology', 'Marketing', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The Beacon Chain is mission-critical and any bug in it could compromise the whole network. The Beacon Chain reference implementation developed by the Ethereum Foundation is written in Python, and provides a detailed operational description of the state machine each Beacon Chain’s network participant (node) must implement. We have formally specified and verified the absence of runtime errors in (a large and critical part of) the Beacon Chain reference implementation using the verification-friendly language Dafny. During the course of this work, we have uncovered several issues, proposed verified fixes. We have also synthesised functional correctness specifications that enable us to provide guarantees beyond runtime errors.

It is well-known that combinations of verifiers via portfolio and selection approaches can help to combine the strengths. In this paper, we investigate (a) how to easily compose such combinations fromexisting, ‘off-the-shelf’ verification tools without changing them and (b) how much performance improvement easy combinations can yield, regarding the effectiveness (number of solved problems) and efficiency (consumed resources). First, we contribute a method to systematically and conveniently construct verifier combinations from existing tools, using the composition frameworkCoVeriTeam. We consider sequential portfolios, parallel portfolios, and algorithm selections. Second, we perform a large experiment on 8 883 verification tasks to show that combinations can improve the verification resultswithoutadditional computational resources. All combinations are constructed from off-the-shelf verifiers, that is, we use them as published. The result of our work suggests that users of verification tools can achieve a significant improvement at a negligible cost (only configure our composition scripts).","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sudeep Kanav"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cedric Richter"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-31424-7_48"", ""10.1145/503272.503274"", ""10.1109/MIS.2014.3"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_43"", ""10.5281/zenodo.4458215"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03421-4_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16722-6_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58768-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58768-0_8"", ""10.1145/3180155.3180259"", ""10.18420/se2019-46"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99524-9_31"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5812021"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_31"", ""10.1002/spe.2949"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_32"", ""10.1007/s10703-016-0264-5"", ""10.1109/FMCAD.2013.6679414"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-37036-6_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_30"", ""10.1145/602382.602403"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49052-6_13"", ""10.1126/science.275.5296.51"", ""10.1145/1592434.1592438"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-11486-1_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_66"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-50137-6_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-19084-6_1"", ""10.1007/BF00143877"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_30"", ""10.1016/S0065-2458(08)60520-3"", ""10.1007/s10515-020-00270-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_19"", ""10.1145/3324884.3416633"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_45"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-74970-7_49"", ""10.1613/jair.2490"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-34413-8_23""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Software', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

The peculiarity of Azerbaijani nation-building is that the debates on how to build a nation and define national identity were nourished by two discourses: Azerbaijanism (Azerbaycançılıq) and Turkism (Tűrkçűlűk). The article focuses firstly on the discourses on national identity and nation-building in the pre-independence period while elaborating on the roots and premises of the nationalist independence movement. Secondly, it highlights the discourses of nation-building in the post-independence period while discussing the meanings attributed to national identity and nationhood. It shows how these two discourses shaped the existing identity formation in Azerbaijan with a particular emphasis on citizenship identity, marked by multiculturalism, hospitality, tolerance, and patriotism. Yet one can still categorize the country as having an incomplete nation-building process, due the violation of territorial integrity as a result of the Karabakh conflict.","[{""name"": ""Ayça Ergun"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00210862.2013.784521"", ""10.1080/01419870.1997.9993966"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511559242"", ""10.1080/01436598908420139"", ""10.1057/9780230508965_2"", ""10.1057/9780230508965_4"", ""10.1080/02634938808400647"", ""10.18574/nyu/9780814770825.001.0001"", ""10.1080/02634938408400462"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-49095-7_7"", ""10.1093/jcs/csz085"", ""10.7312/alts70456"", ""10.1080/09668139408412202"", ""10.1080/00905992.2012.742990"", ""10.1080/00905992.2018.1488826"", ""10.1016/0039-3592(86)90025-6"", ""10.4324/9781315625119"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558764"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1542868"", ""10.1080/10758216.2015.1082124"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598876"", ""10.1080/00905999708408494"", ""10.1080/13602004.2012.694668"", ""10.1080/14683857.2018.1556417"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4967.1999.tb00348.x"", ""10.1080/14616740600793010"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511559204.004"", ""10.1080/713656170"", ""10.1080/714004708"", ""10.1080/17467586.2012.742954""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

10.1017/S0010417522000196,COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN SOCIETY AND HISTORY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,Toward Early Modern Archivality: The Perils of History in the Age of Neo-Eurocentrism,"AbstractThis essay addresses the revival of culturalist assumptions in historical archival studies and suggests an alternative framework. Rather than provenance, it privileges textual circulation; rather than civilizational divides between supposedly distinct “European” and “Islamic” archivalities, it highlights mutability and commensurability as defining elements of a broadly shared, if inherently dynamic, internally complex, and transactionally defined early modern archivality. We first show how the historiography on early modern archives has inadvertently perpetuated a myopic Eurocentric view of the centralized archive as a key aspect of European archivality. We analyze how the construct “Islamic archivality,” when proffered as a comparative counterpoint to such European archivality, not only promotes an outdated understanding of “Islam” (and, indeed “Europe”) as a discrete, transhistorical phenomenon, but rests on a limited set of mostly pre-Ottoman, medieval examples. By positing “Islam” as fundamentally premodern, this historiography sidesteps significant shared late antique genealogies of textual practices and mobilities across a vast early modern region that traverses modern continental/civilizational configurations. In lieu of the prevalent comparative mode, which juxtaposes civilizational blocs and then selectively contrasts specific archival institutions and practices, we suggest concentrating on intersections and circulations of documents and practices across ethnolinguistic, territorial, and juridical boundaries. Drawing on examples from our research in Ottoman diplomatic archives, we challenge scholars of early modern archivality to move beyond fixed notions of “European,” and “non-European,” “centralized” and “decentralized” archives, and “original” and “copy,” as primary indices of comparison, and attend to the social life of documents and their mutability through circulation.","[{""name"": ""Guy Burak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E.

To achieve this, it addresses a variety of sub-problems related to monitoring of systems: These range from the appropriate design of a specification language over efficient monitor generation as hardware and software monitors to solutions for instrumenting the monitored system, preferably in a non-intrusive way. Further aspects play a role for the usability of a runtime verification toolchain, e.g. availability, sufficient documentation and the existence of a developer community. In this paper we present the TeSSLa ecosystem, a runtime verification framework built around the stream runtime verification language TeSSLa: It provides a rich toolchain of mostly freely available compilers for monitor generation on different hardware and software backends, as well as instrumentation mechanisms for various runtime verification requirements. Additionally, we highlight how the online resources and supporting tools of the community-driven project enable the productive usage of stream runtime verification.","[{""name"": ""Hannes Kallwies"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Leucker"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Malte Schmitz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Albert Schulz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Thoma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexander Weiss"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jlap.2008.08.004"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03769-7_16"", ""10.1145/3167132.3167338"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03044-5_10"", ""10.1109/CGO53902.2022.9741275"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-70848-5_12"", ""10.1109/MC.2020.3029975"", ""10.23919/DATE.2018.8342124"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03769-7_5"", ""10.1145/367845.368070"", ""10.1007/3-540-45337-7_18"", ""10.1145/3534879.3534898"", ""10.3233/FAIA210336"", ""10.1007/s11219-019-09493-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-10363-6_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-92124-8_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-32079-9_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-87348-6_6""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Hardware and Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

However, applying inprocessing frequently can still be a bottle neck, i.e., for hard or large formulas. In this work, we introduce the first attempt to parallelize inprocessing on GPU architectures. As memory is a scarce resource in GPUs, we present new space-efficient data structures and devise a data-parallel garbage collector. It runs in parallel on the GPU to reduce memory consumption and improves memory access locality. Our new parallel variable elimination algorithm is twice as fast as previous work. In experiments our new solver ParaFROST solves many benchmarks faster on the GPU than its sequential counterparts.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Osama"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anton Wijs"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Armin Biere"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/2968455.2968520"", ""10.1007/s10462-016-9530-6"", ""10.1007/3-540-49059-0_14"", ""10.3233/FAIA336"", ""10.5281/zenodo.4500928"", ""10.1145/1572769.1572795"", ""10.1109/PDMC-HiBi.2010.11"", ""10.1186/1471-2105-13-281"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-18275-4_7"", ""10.1007/s10817-013-9283-8"", ""10.1007/11499107_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24605-3_37"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-40942-4_6"", ""10.1109/DAC.2007.375231"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-16242-8_26"", ""10.1007/s10817-011-9239-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31365-3_28"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2004.06.062"", ""10.1016/S0166-218X(99)00037-2"", ""10.1145/2426642.2259002"", ""10.1145/307418.307477"", ""10.1109/12.769433"", ""10.1109/TII.2017.2723960"", ""10.1109/ICTAI50040.2020.00035"", ""10.1007/s10836-018-5747-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17462-0_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-34968-4_29"", ""10.1007/3-540-46135-3_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-24258-9_26"", ""10.1145/3315573.3329979"", ""10.1109/43.536723"", ""10.1007/11527695_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48989-6_42"", ""10.1109/PDP.2015.59""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"
10.1017/ssh.2023.37,SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY,0603 World History,Reverberations of Empire: How the Colonial Past Shapes the Present,"AbstractModern colonialism from the eighteenth century onward encompassed most of the world’s surface. Today, the world is different. In theory at least, nation-states rather than empires and colonies are the global norm. The sorts of colonial conquests that mark earlier centuries appear to have ended. But does this mean colonialism in the past is not relevant for the present? Scholarly and popular discussions allude to the idea that past colonialism impacts the present, using a variety of terms like “legacies,” “imprints,” “vestiges,” “ruins,” or “afterlives.” Yet existing scholarship has yet to fully clarify and catalog the specific processes and mechanisms that connect colonial history with its putative legacies. This essay, based upon the 2022 Presidential Address to the Social Science History Association, identifies and discusses four such processes and mechanisms or “modes of reverberation”: (1) continued colonialism through simple reproduction, (2) the persistence of power through formal and informal institutionalization, (3) path dependent historical trajectories (or “colonial institutionalism”), and (4) colonialism’s archive of meaning.","[{""name"": ""Julian Go"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1354066110383997"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139047777"", ""10.1515/9780691237435"", ""10.1177/00905917231193107"", ""10.3998/mpub.11747103"", ""10.1086/708464"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12993"", ""10.2307/j.ctv123x6t0.6"", ""10.1017/ssh.2018.1"", ""10.2307/2010449"", ""10.1515/9781503634138"", ""10.1525/9780520918085"", ""10.1086/499510"", ""10.1177/2332649214560440"", ""10.1086/229967"", ""10.1080/00380253.2019.1580550"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316271674"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226470702.001.0001"", ""10.1126/science.abe4943"", ""10.1177/0011392117750212"", ""10.1093/oso/9780197673027.001.0001"", ""10.1017/ssh.2020.2"", ""10.1177/1368431012462448"", ""10.1257/aer.20131311"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316271674.007"", ""10.1177/0022343317747955"", ""10.1177/0002716214543899"", ""10.1177/2332649218799369"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043131"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316271674.002"", ""10.1111/roie.12288"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1324169"", ""10.1093/dh/dhw009"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511996559"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9020.2009.00232.x"", ""10.4159/9780674249998"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195304596.001.0001"", ""10.7765/9781526163455"", ""10.1017/ssh.2015.5"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2010.01.002"", ""10.1215/9780822381167"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.051508.214538"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511750328"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511801938.008"", ""10.1017/9781009199100"", ""10.7312/erik18434"", ""10.1086/723107"", ""10.1093/jae/ejs001"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.2010.01194.x""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

PAYNT enables the synthesis of finite-state probabilistic programs from a program sketch representing a finite family of program candidates. A tight interaction between inductive oracle-guided methods with state-of-the-art probabilistic model checking is at the heart of PAYNT. These oracle-guided methods effectively reason about all possible candidates and synthesise programs that meet a given specification formulated as a conjunction of temporal logic constraints and possibly including an optimising objective. We demonstrate the performance and usefulness of PAYNT using several case studies from different application domains; e.g., we find the optimal randomized protocol for network stabilisation among 3M potential programs within minutes, whereas alternative approaches would need days to do so.","[{""name"": ""Roman Andriushchenko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Milan Češka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Junges"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joost-Pieter Katoen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Šimon Stupinský"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-07317-0_3"", ""10.1109/FMCAD.2013.6679385"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72016-2_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-19835-9_30"", ""10.1109/43.766730"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_9"", ""10.1016/j.jss.2018.05.013"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66335-7_20"", ""10.1007/s00236-016-0265-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30942-8_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17465-1_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30806-3_7"", ""10.1007/s00165-017-0432-4"", ""10.1007/s10009-012-0234-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-31862-0_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11936-6_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_31"", ""10.1145/361179.361202"", ""10.1109/ASE.2015.22"", ""10.1007/s10515-018-0235-8"", ""10.1016/j.infsof.2012.07.017"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_5"", ""10.1007/s10009-010-0146-x"", ""10.1145/2379776.2379787"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_51"", ""10.1016/0020-0190(90)90107-9"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.256.2"", ""10.1145/1806799.1806833"", ""10.1007/s00236-017-0294-5"", ""10.1016/S0004-3702(98)00023-X"", ""10.1007/s00165-012-0227-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_47"", ""10.1016/j.infsof.2017.10.001"", ""10.1145/288197.581195"", ""10.1145/1712605.1712624"", ""10.1145/2813885.2737982"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46520-3_4"", ""10.1145/3290350"", ""10.1145/1064978.1065045"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95582-7_19"", ""10.2168/LMCS-11(1:15)2015""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

The tool is able to generate significant loads to reveal edge case behaviour that may only emerge when the monitoring system is pushed to its limit. We evaluate our framework in two ways. First, we conduct sanity checks to assess the precision of the measurement mechanisms used, the repeatability of the results obtained, and the veracity of the behaviour emulated by our synthetic benchmark.

That work has generally emphasised program correctness, i.e., proving the absence of bugs. Recently, Incorrectness Logic (IL) has been advanced as a formalism for the dual problem: proving the presence of bugs. IL is intended to underpin the use of logic in program testing and static bug finding. Here, we use a Kleene algebra with diamond operators and countable joins of tests, which embeds IL, and which also is complete for reasoning about the image of the embedding. Next to embedding IL, the algebra is able to embed HL, and allows making connections between IL and HL specifications. In this sense, it unifies correctness and incorrectness reasoning in one formalism.","[{""name"": ""Bernhard Möller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter O’Hearn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tony Hoare"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/357146.357150"", ""10.1145/3453483.3454076"", ""10.1017/S096012950000030X"", ""10.1007/11513988_8"", ""10.1007/BFb0054287"", ""10.1145/2984450.2984457"", ""10.1109/LICS52264.2021.9470608"", ""10.1145/2408776.2408795"", ""10.1007/BF00288686"", ""10.1145/512950.512973"", ""10.1145/1183278.1183285"", ""10.1090/psapm/019/0235771"", ""10.1145/1190215.1190226"", ""10.1007/3-540-09237-4"", ""10.1145/363235.363259"", ""10.1145/1562764.1562779"", ""10.1016/j.jlap.2011.04.005"", ""10.1007/s00165-012-0249-0"", ""10.1023/A:1008271805106"", ""10.1006/inco.1994.1037"", ""10.1145/343369.343378"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2005.09.069"", ""10.1145/3211968"", ""10.1145/3371078"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-24690-6_12""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

The article contextualizes this body of scholarship within larger recent and older trends in the discipline. Recently, historians and other scholars have predominantly analyzed port cities as “nodal points” or “hubs” within global networks. The article argues that these perspectives project spatial patterns defined by the imaginary of globalization today into the past, failing to acknowledge how tightly interwoven globalization and urbanization were in port cities during the age of steam. However, port cities can provide concrete narrative focal points to develop empirically‐grounded global histories, and remind us of the various efforts to control, limit, or prevent unsolicited forms of mobility and entanglement in the sites where these were moored or fixed. Finally, port cities can render the labor of the urban masses visible that facilitated the making of steam age connectivity and a globality anchored in the urban space of the ports.","[{""name"": ""Lasse Heerten"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The resulting shift away from this child labor–intensive crop lowered the opportunity cost of school attendance. We investigate the insect’s long-run effect on educational attainment using a sample of adults from the 1940 census linked back to their childhood census records. Both white and black children who were young (ages 4 to 9) when the weevil arrived saw increased educational attainment by 0.24 to 0.36 years.

Set against the background of decolonizing South and Southeast Asia in the aftermath of World War Two, it follows the judgment in a little-known suit for recovery of debt, filed at a district-level civil court in Madras in British India, which escaped the attention of local legal practitioners, but made its way into an international law treatise compiled and written in Utrecht, twenty years later. Instead of using it to trace how South Asian judiciaries interpreted international law, the Article looks at why claims to international law were made by ordinary litigants like Chettiar women in everyday cases like debt settlements, and how they became “evidence” of state practice for international law. These intertwined itineraries of law, that take place against the Japanese occupation of Burma and the Dutch East Indies and the postwar reconstruction efforts in Rangoon, Madras and Batavia, show how jurisdictional claims made by ordinary litigants form an underappreciated archive for histories of international law. In talking about the creation and circulation of legal knowledges, this Article argues that this involves thinking about and writing from footnotes, postscripts and marginalia - and the lives that are intertwined in them.","[{""name"": ""Kalyani Ramnath"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S092215650999032X"", ""10.1017/9781316659083"", ""10.4159/9780674986275"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107256545"", ""10.1525/9780520376533"", ""10.1017/S0738248014000467"", ""10.1017/S0738248000002583"", ""10.1017/S0738248017000256"", ""10.1017/S0022463400008432"", ""10.1177/002088176100300305"", ""10.1017/S0922156518000237""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S1479244321000196,MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Globalizing Racism and De-provincializing Muslim Africa,"One of the paradoxes of history is that it took Africa's contact with the Arab world to make the Black people of Africa realize that they were black in description, but not necessarily in status … On the other hand, it took European conceptualization and cartography to turn Africa into a continent.Ali A. Mazrui, “The Re-invention of Africa: Edward Said, V. Y. Mudimbe, and Beyond,”Research in African Literatures36/3 (2005), 68–82, at 70Historians of Africa can no longer overlook race. To scholars of African-diaspora studies (who often work under the rubric of Africana studies, black studies, and African American studies), the recognition of this fact is long overdue. With the rise of the area-studies paradigm in the 1950s, North American scholars of Africa became preoccupied with the rise of nationalism and the writing or critique of national histories. The future was defined by national development, while the study of the past was centered on the search for a pristine precolonial identity. Consequently, a world of nations took precedence in scholarly writing over concerns about the management of empires, colonies and, strikingly, races. Even as Africanist scholars came to reevaluate the successes and failures of the postcolonial experience across Africa in the 1970s, they frequently lamented the persistence of ethnic conflict, but not of ongoing forms of racial hierarchy. Race, insofar as it was treated at all, tended to be confined to the “colonial episode” and to settler states, like South Africa.","[{""name"": ""Alden Young"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Keren Weitzberg"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780195067743.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77krt"", ""10.1525/california/9780520273818.001.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520929364-004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511575457"", ""10.2307/2657316"", ""10.1017/S0021853708003915"", ""10.1163/9789047413349"", ""10.1017/S002185371400070X"", ""10.4159/9780674258143"", ""10.3406/outre.2002.3990"", ""10.2307/2953315"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511997594"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195180817.001.0001"", ""10.1353/jsh.2003.0143"", ""10.1017/S0010417599001875"", ""10.9783/9780812295498"", ""10.1017/S0041977X14000512"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511810480"", ""10.1017/S0001972020000091"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226923048.001.0001"", ""10.2979/RAL.2005.36.3.68"", ""10.1080/13629395.2018.1564508"", ""10.1017/S0021853700016741"", ""10.1080/00064246.2000.11431064"", ""10.1515/9781626373310"", ""10.4159/9780674969377"", ""10.1163/157006600X00627"", ""10.2307/523773"", ""10.1353/dsp.1991.0023"", ""10.2307/525389"", ""10.2979/reseafrilite.2011.42.1.1"", ""10.1017/S1740022807002045"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976766""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article proposes to consider it instead as a “heuristic formula” within the “lexical architecture” of thePrison Notebooks. Based upon a diachronic and contextualist analysis of the usage of the formula, I argue that Gramsci's research on passive revolution emerged as a critical element within the development of his own distinctive conception of the “sublation” and “actualization” of the slogan of “the revolution in permanence.” Attending to this dialectical relationship allows the political and strategic dimensions of passive revolution to be highlighted, and suggests new paths of research for the debate about its analytic fertility and contemporary relevance.","[{""name"": ""PETER D.

It argues that coercion and the prospect of coercion play important roles in policing the contours of everyday nationalism. The state is able to infuse nationalism and authoritarian control into everyday life, but the “success” of its efforts has limits. This is due to social changes and the ways that material failures nurtured doubts about the legitimacy of the government among some citizens. It draws on data from North Korean state media, secondary historical literature, and 58 semi-structured interviews with North Koreans living in South Korea.","[{""name"": ""Alexander Dukalskis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Junhyoung Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0192512115616830"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1154137"", ""10.4324/9781315455532"", ""10.1080/13569775.2019.1570424"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12188"", ""10.1017/S1537592718004024"", ""10.1080/13563460902826005"", ""10.1177/0010414011434295"", ""10.1080/14672715.2019.1611462"", ""10.2753/PPC1075-8216590301"", ""10.1080/13569775.2017.1304322"", ""10.1080/09512748.2016.1201134"", ""10.5129/001041512798838021"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12065"", ""10.1017/S1537592717002183"", ""10.1017/gov.2018.40"", ""10.5129/001041512800078977"", ""10.1080/10758216.2016.1145065"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2007.10.003"", ""10.1080/13569775.2017.1304320"", ""10.1080/13569317.2018.1419448"", ""10.5509/200881153"", ""10.1515/9780804768016"", ""10.1177/2057891118760403"", ""10.1080/03085140903424618"", ""10.1353/apr.2002.0018"", ""10.1177/1468796808088925"", ""10.1080/09512748.2013.846931"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139021692"", ""10.5771/9781442215771"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2014.04.003"", ""10.1017/gov.2018.17"", ""10.1080/14742837.2019.1597698"", ""10.17789/discou.2012.15.4.004"", ""10.1086/703209"", ""10.1080/14690760500317743"", ""10.1080/13510347.2013.738860"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00002"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2009.09.009"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2014.04.002""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S1053837220000115,JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF ECONOMIC THOUGHT,0603 World History,ELLEN RICHARDS'S HOME ECONOMICS MOVEMENT AND THE BIRTH OF THE ECONOMICS OF CONSUMPTION,"In 1899, MIT chemist Ellen H. Richards (1842–1911) instigated a series of annual “Lake Placid Conferences” (1899–1908) that became known as the foundation of the home economics movement. Richards’s first interest was in improving the household’s well-being by using sanitary and nutrition sciences, an objective that was passed on to the movement. However, by the 1920s, home economists rather identified their field of expertise as the “science of consumption,” emphasizing the idea of “rational consumption.” My aim in this article is to give an account of how this shift in focus came about, by telling the story of the home economics movement founded by Richards. I examine how the movement problematized consumption by highlighting its relationship, and perception of itself, regarding economics. I argue that the concept of consumption was central to the structuring of the movement from its beginning and allowed home economists to claim it as their field of expertise because, as they believed, economists were not addressing the issue.","[{""name"": ""David Philippy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S1053837212000375"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226505435.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781118923849"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-95121-5_2760-1"", ""10.1353/lac.2004.0058"", ""10.2307/1052482"", ""10.5962/bhl.title.109079"", ""10.2307/2711568"", ""10.1080/13545709610001707746"", ""10.1215/00182702-1997-suppl_1014"", ""10.2307/2712458"", ""10.1515/9781400822522"", ""10.1215/15476715-1-2-89"", ""10.2307/25094959"", ""10.1353/wsq.2011.0066"", ""10.1515/9781400873302"", ""10.1002/9780470999059.ch15"", ""10.5040/9798400641503"", ""10.1017/S1537781419000288"", ""10.4324/9781315723570-14"", ""10.7591/9781501729942"", ""10.1086/250665"", ""10.4324/9780203882320"", ""10.1080/09672567.2014.881899"", ""10.1080/13545700110111136"", ""10.7591/9781501729942"", ""10.5149/9780807872383_goldstein"", ""10.7591/9781501729942""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Conservation'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

In this paper, we study verification and interpretability problems for Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs), the 1-bit quantization of general real-numbered neural networks. Our approach is to encode BNNs into Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), which is done by exploiting the internal structure of the BNNs. In particular, we translate the input-output relation of blocks in BNNs to cardinality constraints which are in turn encoded by BDDs. Based on the encoding, we develop a quantitative framework for BNNs where precise and comprehensive analysis of BNNs can be performed. We demonstrate the application of our framework by providing quantitative robustness analysis and interpretability for BNNs. We implement a prototype tool and carry out extensive experiments, confirming the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","[{""name"": ""Yedi Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhe Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guangke Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fu Song"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Taolue Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.26226/morressier.604907f41a80aac83ca25cda"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314614"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_5"", ""10.1109/ICSE-Companion52605.2021.00115"", ""10.1145/3319535.3354245"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-51074-9_2"", ""10.1007/3-540-36577-X_28"", ""10.1109/TC.1986.1676819"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03592-1_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-77935-5_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_3"", ""10.1109/SP.2018.00058"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_5"", ""10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16496"", ""10.1016/j.cosrev.2020.100270"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2016.09.010"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26"", ""10.4271/2019-01-0123"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94144-8_27"", ""10.1007/s11265-017-1255-5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-32304-2_15"", ""10.1145/3368089.3417918"", ""10.1007/s11390-020-0546-7"", ""10.1023/A:1008643722423"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-65965-3_28"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2005.05.003"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/811"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.12206"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-24258-9_19"", ""10.1145/3052973.3053009"", ""10.1109/EuroSP.2016.36"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46493-0_32"", ""10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071516-044442"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-24258-9_25"", ""10.1145/3290354"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30942-8_39"", ""10.26226/morressier.604907f41a80aac83ca25cfb"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00642"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_8""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

Such properties are becoming increasingly important and naturally occur, e.g., in information-flow control, robustness, mutation testing, path planning, and causality checking. Thus far, complete model checking tools for HyperLTL have been limited to alternation-free formulas, i.e., formulas that use only universal or only existential trace quantification. Properties involving quantifier alternations could only be handled in an incomplete way, i.e., the verification might fail even though the property holds. In this paper, we present , an explicit-state automata-based model checker that supports full HyperLTL and is complete for properties with arbitrary quantifier alternations. We show that language inclusion checks can be integrated into HyperLTL verification, which allows to benefit from a range of existing inclusion-checking tools. We evaluate on a broad set of benchmarks drawn from different areas in the literature and compare it with existing (incomplete) methods for HyperLTL verification.","[{""name"": ""Raven Beutner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bernd Finkbeiner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_31"", ""10.1017/S0960129511000193"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7309986"", ""10.1145/3531130.3533369"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.CONCUR.2021.24"", ""10.1109/CSF54842.2022.00030"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-13185-1_17"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2301.11229"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2203.07283"", ""10.1007/3-540-49059-0_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_5"", ""10.1007/3-540-45657-0_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24622-0_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_15"", ""10.1109/CSF.2008.7"", ""10.23638/LMCS-15(1:12)2019"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-19992-9_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_7"", ""10.1007/3-540-44585-4_43"", ""10.1007/BF00121128"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54434-1_4"", ""10.1145/1007912.1007945"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-13188-2_6"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.CONCUR.2021.3"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-13188-2_9"", ""10.1007/s10270-020-00850-1"", ""10.1080/10618600.2012.738106"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_3"", ""10.1145/78969.78972"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72016-2_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-29963-6_10"", ""10.1145/361082.361093"", ""10.1109/SECPRI.1988.8110"", ""10.2168/LMCS-3(3:5)2007"", ""10.1145/268946.268975"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_62"", ""10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196874""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

A nested and integrative approach is developed that draws on a wide range of spatially extensive datasets to outline meaningful trends in settlement, water management and regional defensive systems during the Bronze and Iron Ages. The significance of the regional centre of Türkmen-Karahöyük for a reconstruction of early state polities between the 13th and eighth centuries BCE is addressed. In light of this regional analysis, it is tentatively suggested that, during the Late Bronze Age, Türkmen-Karahöyük was the location of the city of Tarḫuntašša, briefly the Hittite capital during the reign of Muwatalli II. More assuredly, based on the analysis of the newly discovered Middle Iron Age TÜRKMEN-KARAHÖYÜK 1 inscription, it is proposed that Türkmen-Karahöyük was the seat of a kingdom during the eighth century BCE that likely encompassed the Konya and Karaman plains.","[{""name"": ""Michele Massa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christoph Bachhuber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fatma Şahin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hüseyin Erpehlivan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Osborne"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anthony J.

It is also the exemplar of how that regime became a site for the establishment of postcolonial sovereignty, globally. Tunisia and Morocco, newly independent, requested UNHCR’s help in assisting hundreds of thousands of Algerian refugees: interacting with the refugee regime allowed them to establish their credentials as independent states while asserting sovereignty over their own territories. In Algeria, the 1951 Refugee Convention applied before the war started, and UNHCR worked there to support ‘old’ refugees. During the war, the Front de Libération Nationale asserted itself as a state-in-waiting by engaging with UNHCR outside Algeria as the agency coordinated a vast relief operation. After the war, as refugees returned to a landscape riven by mass displacement, interacting with the refugee regime helped the new state assert sovereignty over Algeria’s territory, and Algerian bodies.","[{""name"": ""Malika Rahal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benjamin Thomas White"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The agency of Asian and North African activists in this programme remains largely unknown, and their wartime collaboration in Germany is an under-researched topic in the histories of anti-colonial activism. This article explores the collaboration between the three committees, highlighting their strategic relationships with German officials and with each other. Criticizing the Eurocentric framings still present in studies of wartime strategy, it contributes to a growing historiography on the war as a global conflict. It argues that the independence committees were central actors in Germany’s programme, that the transnationalism of the pre-1914 anti-colonial movements both imprinted Germany’s programme and was furthered by it, and that only a comparative perspective exploring the interactions of its anti-colonial activists fully grasps the global scope of this topic.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Jenkins"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Heike Liebau"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Larissa Schmid"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00263206.2011.553898"", ""10.1080/02619280802442589"", ""10.1163/9789004310018_003"", ""10.1177/0968344510393596"", ""10.1017/S1740022807002318"", ""10.56021/9780801888243"", ""10.1057/9780230604285_8"", ""10.1515/9783112400494"", ""10.1093/ahr/117.5.1461"", ""10.1017/9781316471487"", ""10.1080/19472498.2013.824684"", ""10.13109/gege.2010.36.4.523"", ""10.5871/jba/004.001"", ""10.1215/1089201X-24-2-145"", ""10.1057/9780230339514"", ""10.2307/1432596"", ""10.1177/0022009412472713"", ""10.1080/19436149.2014.905080"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674726314"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_605452"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004185456.i-618.33"", ""10.1080/19472498.2011.605295"", ""10.1017/S1740022815000236""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

In this article, I study a key dimension of this preoccupation with population trends: the quantity of the Jewish population, that is, the number of Jews. I show the centrality of this dimension in shaping a cluster of anxious discourses and interventionist engagements directed toward stemming numerical decline. Analyzing this policy world in terms of a “Jewish biopolitics,” I assess how the voluntary nature of American Jewry has shaped a distinct biopolitical field, reliant on “making Jews” by both biological and cultural reproduction, enmeshing dimensions of quantity and quality. Juxtaposing this Jewish biopolitical engagement with the one exercised by the Israeli state, I flesh out broader considerations and contributions, and introduce the exploratory concept of “minority community biopolitics.” The article is grounded in an anthropological study of policy, including fieldwork, interviews, and a review of the flurry of archival and public materials related to the topic.","[{""name"": ""Michal Kravel-Tovi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01419870020036701d"", ""10.1525/9780520943704"", ""10.1023/A:1011084821700"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199311071.001.0001"", ""10.18574/nyu/9780814757307.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190258900.001.0001"", ""10.7312/krav18324"", ""10.1111/mepo.12406"", ""10.26812/9781584656319"", ""10.26812/9781584656357"", ""10.1093/ahr/122.5.1459"", ""10.1215/9780822378204"", ""10.1017/S0010417500020119"", ""10.1017/S0010417507000448"", ""10.1558/sols.v4i1.1"", ""10.1515/9780804767217"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300216882.001.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520937130"", ""10.1111/aman.13123"", ""10.1177/0363199018759650"", ""10.1353/ajh.2018.0050"", ""10.36019/9780813562933"", ""10.1080/13648470.2012.675050"", ""10.1016/S0277-5395(97)00055-1"", ""10.1515/ijsl-2018-0015"", ""10.1515/ijsl-2018-0012"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2303.2012.00611.x"", ""10.3167/9780857451163"", ""10.26812/9781584654605"", ""10.1007/s12397-010-9058-z"", ""10.1515/9780691207285"", ""10.1080/01419870.2011.588338"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5cg8hr"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01368.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctv102bgbt.11"", ""10.18574/nyu/9780814748169.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"
10.1017/ssh.2020.44,SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY,0603 World History,The Revival of Quantification: Reflections on Old New Histories,"AbstractQuantitative historical analysis in the United States surged in three distinct waves. The first quantitative wave occurred as part of the “New History” that blossomed in the early twentieth century and disappeared in the 1940s and 1950s with the rise of consensus history. The second wave thrived from the 1960s to the 1980s during the ascendance of the New Economic History, the New Political History, and the New Social History, and died out during the “cultural turn” of the late twentieth century. The third wave of historical quantification—which I call the revival of quantification—emerged in the second decade of the twenty-first century and is still underway. I describe characteristics of each wave and discuss the historiographical context of the ebb and flow of quantification in history.","[{""name"": ""Steven Ruggles"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/05775132.2001.11034124"", ""10.1017/S0022050700079882"", ""10.2307/2090404"", ""10.1126/science.1199644"", ""10.1017/S0145553200022586"", ""10.2307/2598489"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511816345"", ""10.1093/hwj/7.1.66"", ""10.2307/2504170"", ""10.1017/ssh.2016.22"", ""10.2307/286263"", ""10.2307/204919"", ""10.1086/ahr.113.2.393"", ""10.1353/jsh/10.2.205"", ""10.1177/002200946800300101"", ""10.1353/ajh.2014.0031"", ""10.2307/1838208"", ""10.1353/jsh/9.1.99"", ""10.2307/1920847"", ""10.1162/JINH_a_01160"", ""10.1017/S014555320001587X"", ""10.1017/9780511862489.002"", ""10.2307/1839356"", ""10.1162/JINH_a_01159"", ""10.2307/3660526"", ""10.17723/aarc.17.1.g944vnq5236h4r01"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.62147-5"", ""10.7312/ware93274-038"", ""10.1016/0014-4983(75)90021-2"", ""10.1080/01615449809601196"", ""10.1177/002200948602100202"", ""10.2307/1833685"", ""10.1177/002200946800300202"", ""10.1177/000276427702100203"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226676319.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-229X.1966.tb01174.x"", ""10.1257/jep.9.2.191"", ""10.4324/9781315734736-3"", ""10.2307/1840442"", ""10.2307/2590261"", ""10.2307/1904534"", ""10.2307/1862991"", ""10.1016/0014-4983(75)90020-0"", ""10.1093/past/65.1.75"", ""10.1016/0014-4983(75)90019-4"", ""10.2307/1836730"", ""10.1111/1468-2303.00247"", ""10.3138/jsp.44.3.002"", ""10.2307/2599988"", ""10.1017/S0022050700079092""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

Traditional approaches cover individual aspects, like data exchange formats and published interfaces. They may adhere to some standard, however they hardly cover the production of the integration layer, which is implemented as bespoke glue code that is hard to produce and even harder to maintain. Therefore, the traditional integration approach often leads to poor code quality, further increasing the time and cost and reducing the agility, and a high reliance on the individual development skills. We are instead tackling the interoperability challenge by building a model driven/low-code Digital Thread platform that 1) systematizes the integration methodology, 2) provides methods and techniques for the individual integrations based on a layered Domain Specific Languages (DSL) approach, 3) through the DSLs it covers the integration space domain by domain, technology by technology, and is thus highly generalizable and reusable, 4) showcases a first collection of examples from the domains of robotics, IoT, data analytics, AI/ML and web applications, 5) brings cohesiveness to the aforementioned heterogeneous platform, and 6) is easier to understand and maintain, even by not specialized programmers. We showcase the power, versatility and the potential of the Digital Thread platform on four interoperability case studies: the generic extension to REST services, to robotics through the UR family of robots, to the integration of various external databases (for data integration) and to the provision of data analytics capabilities in R.","[{""name"": ""Tiziana Margaria"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hafiz Ahmad Awais Chaudhary"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ivan Guevara"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephen Ryan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexander Schieweck"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/JSYST.2020.3041259"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-89159-6_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31646-4_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-47169-3_60"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2020.01.083"", ""10.15514/ISPRAS-2021-33(4)-2"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2966919"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-89159-6_16"", ""10.1109/IEEM45057.2020.9309952"", ""10.1109/TII.2016.2596101"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-89159-6_10"", ""10.1109/FDL53530.2021.9568378"", ""10.1109/EASE.2007.17"", ""10.1109/EASE.2007.17"", ""10.1109/IOT.2015.7356548"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.206"", ""10.3390/fi11020036"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-89159-6_14"", ""10.1109/MC.2006.355"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-72496-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-04930-9_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-34968-4_1"", ""10.1007/BFb0053591"", ""10.4018/978-1-60566-288-6.ch001"", ""10.1109/MC.2010.177"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-2297-5_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-10576-1_208"", ""10.1109/MS.2003.1231145"", ""10.3233/jid-2013-0008"", ""10.1016/j.future.2019.11.028"", ""10.1016/j.jmsy.2020.01.007"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0453-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-45234-9_5"", ""10.1109/INDIN.2018.8471971"", ""10.1007/s10209-020-00751-6"", ""10.3390/app11031097"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31646-4_7"", ""10.1109/IECON43393.2020.9254274"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-33933-7"", ""10.1080/0951192X.2020.1775295"", ""10.3390/app10010012"", ""10.1016/j.simpat.2020.102126"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91908-9_17"", ""10.1007/s10009-014-0339-9"", ""10.1007/3-540-48092-7_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-70889-6_7"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.10.060"", ""10.1145/2465449.2465469"", ""10.1002/sres.2705"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007206"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16722-6_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-89159-6_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-89159-6_27""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Information Systems', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

This paper presents municipal and state information on wages and prices in order to build welfare ratios for skilled and unskilled workers between 1912 and 1940. Despite the significant differences in nominal wages and costs of living throughout the country, real wage differentials remained lower than those estimated by earlier studies. Williamson (1999) argued that real wages in the Southeast were approximately six times higher than in the Northeast during the 1930s. The new evidence in this paper suggests that wages were on average only 1.5 times higher.","[{""name"": ""Thales Augusto Zamberlan Pereira"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2139/ssrn.3128189"", ""10.1017/S0212610900002287"", ""10.1006/exeh.1995.1006"", ""10.1080/00220388308421855"", ""10.1590/S0104-59702007000100010"", ""10.1590/S0102-311X2009000500001"", ""10.2307/2060436"", ""10.3386/w8778"", ""10.1086/450136"", ""10.1590/0101-416146128aaa"", ""10.1590/S0074-02761916000300001"", ""10.1086/450061"", ""10.2307/1880562"", ""10.1016/B978-85-352-4839-5.50010-7"", ""10.1108/S0363-326820180000034001"", ""10.1515/9781400882977"", ""10.2307/1884117"", ""10.1590/S0101-31572009000400005"", ""10.1257/aer.20161080"", ""10.1086/450438"", ""10.1006/exeh.2001.0775"", ""10.1080/00220388308421866"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtt020"", ""10.1590/S0034-89101986000200002"", ""10.1080/13547860500291562"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00566.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817649"", ""10.1017/S021261091500004X"", ""10.61673/ren.2012.253"", ""10.1007/s10109-009-0094-8"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00515.x""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Improving the training experience in such complex contexts requires ecological validity of virtual training. To achieve this, VR systems need to be capable of simulating the complex experiences of police officers ‘in the field.’ One way to do this is to add stressors into training simulations to induce stress similar to the stress experienced in real-life situations, particularly in situations where this is difficult (e.g., dangerous or resource-intensive) to achieve with traditional training. To include stressors in VR, this paper thus presents the concept of so-called ‘stress cues’ for operationalizing stressors to augment training in VR simulations for the context of police work. Considering the level of complexity of police work and training, a co-creation process that allows for creative collaboration and mitigation of power imbalances was chosen to access the police officers’ knowledge and experience. We assert that stress cues can improve the training experience from the trainer’s perspective as they provide novel interaction design possibilities for trainers to control the training experience. E.g., by actively intervening in training and dynamically changing the interaction space for trainees which also improves the trainee’s experience. Stress cues can also improve the trainee’s experience by enabling personalizable and customizable training based on real-time stress measurements and supplementing information for improved training feedback.","[{""name"": ""Quynh Nguyen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emma Jaspaert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Markus Murtinger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Helmut Schrom-Feiertag"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Egger-Lampl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Manfred Tscheligi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1300/J158v02n02_01"", ""10.1177/0011000083112010"", ""10.1089/cyber.2009.0336"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2021.586553"", ""10.1145/1621995.1622032"", ""10.1145/1878537.1878571"", ""10.1145/3328020.3353938"", ""10.30773/pi.2017.08.17"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.033"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2017.00626a"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-9803-9.ch007"", ""10.18280/ijsse.110402"", ""10.1186/s13102-018-0094-4"", ""10.1080/00140139.2019.1677948"", ""10.3357/AMHP.4596.2016"", ""10.1007/s11896-007-9012-5"", ""10.1080/15710882.2011.563314"", ""10.1145/1226969.1226993"", ""10.1080/15710880500135987"", ""10.1145/3340764.3349525""]","['Psychology', 'Computer Science']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Social Psychology', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

While decolonization is often presented as the ‘success story’ of international organizations, these bodies have also been condemned as instruments of neocolonialism. This introduction and special issue moves beyond this binary and investigates the multifaceted roles that international organizations have played in decolonizing countries and how the dissolution of European empires has in turn affected the development of international organizations. International organizations were neither straightforward tools of empire or neocolonialism, nor natural instruments for ‘Third World’ liberation. Rather, the contributions collected here underline a history of decolonization that defies any teleological framing and emphasizes diverse trajectories of global interaction facilitated through international organizations. The introduction offers an overview of recent literature on the topic and discusses promising avenues for further research.","[{""name"": ""Eva-Maria Muschik"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['History'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

Taking rats as my primary historical actors, I show how humans attempted to prevent the movement of these animals between ports across three periods. Firstly, the mid- to- late-nineteenth century, where few attempts were made to prevent rats from boarding ships, and where a multiplicity of human/rat relationships can be located. Secondly, the 1890s–1920s, in which port authorities erected anti-rat borders to lock these animals on land or at sea. Finally, the 1920s–50s, where ships were reconstructed to eliminate all possibilities of rodent inhabitation and to interrupt their transit between ports. Ship rats, I argue, not only demonstrate the fragility of historical rodent-control efforts, but also encourage oceanic historians to consider how animals have negotiated and shaped boundaries between spheres of land and sea.","[{""name"": ""Jules Skotnes-Brown"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Geography, Planning and Development', 'Food Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)]]"
10.1017/S1479244321000032,MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Putting Neoliberalism in Its Place,"Neoliberalism is an ideal subject for intellectual historians. It is an ideological movement that has been both theoretically sophisticatedandinfluential, ensuring that excursions along the highways and byways of neoliberal thought can always be justified practically, as disclosing the ideas that have shaped contemporary politics. There is also no shortage of source material, as the voluble characters who generated neoliberal ideology wrote innumerable books and articles and left behind extensive archival collections that preserve their correspondence, drafts and records of meetings. Furthermore, there is abundant evidence of the collaboration (and tensions) between the key neoliberal thinkers, since they worked together in their long years in the wilderness as members of the Mont Pèlerin Society (MPS), the invitation-only discussion group formed by Friedrich Hayek in 1947 to restate the case for market liberalism, and with various associated think tanks scattered across the globe. Given all this, it is surprising that more historical research hadn't focused on neoliberalism earlier, but the field was largely left clear for philosophers and social scientists until the 2000s. Much of this work was in any case historicist in character, notably the influential lectures of Michel Foucault, delivered in 1979 but only published in French in 2004 and in English in 2008, which scrutinized certain key texts of neoliberal theory some time before other scholars had focused on them. The years around the 2008–9 financial crisis—by a mixture of accident and design—marked the point at which intellectual historians (and social scientists with an interest in the history of ideas) followed Foucault by diving more systematically into tracing the origins and trajectory of neoliberal thought. Much of this research has concentrated on the MPS, although the MPS itself is probably best understood as a useful entry point for exploring several distinct strands of market liberalism that emerged in different places in the 1930s and 1940s before being woven together into a broader transnational movement of ideas in the course of the 1950s and 1960s. In spite of skeptical voices claiming either that “neoliberalism” does not exist, or that if it does exist it is best analyzed as the assertion of class interests rather than as an ideology, this work has cumulatively demonstrated that tracing the history of neoliberal thought is an indispensable exercise if we are to understand how we have reached the present conjuncture.","[{""name"": ""Ben Jackson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4159/harvard.9780674067431"", ""10.1353/cap.2020.0001"", ""10.1017/S0018246X09990392"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1qft0n6"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195324877.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108697262"", ""10.1215/17432197-7725521"", ""10.1080/01916599.2017.1365745"", ""10.1017/S1479244313000425"", ""10.1515/9783828260184"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000625"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc775rf"", ""10.1515/9781400885237-006""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"
10.1017/S0010417519000392,COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN SOCIETY AND HISTORY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,Outside Caste? The Enclosure of Caste and Claims to Castelessness in India and the United Kingdom,"AbstractCaste has always generated political and scholarly controversy, but the forms that this takes today newly combine anti-caste activism with counter-claims that caste is irrelevant or non-existent, or claims to castelessness. Claims to castelessness are, in turn, viewed by some as a new disguise for caste power and privilege, while castlessness is also an aspiration for people subject to caste-based discrimination. This article looks at elite claims to “enclose” caste within religion, specifically Hinduism, and the Indian nation so as to restrict the field of social policy that caste applies to, to exempt caste-based discrimination from the law, and to limit the social politics of caste. It does so through a comparative analysis of two cases. The first is the exclusion of Christian and Muslim Dalits—members of castes subordinated as “untouchable”—from provisions and protections as Scheduled Castes in India. The other case is that of responses to the introduction of caste into anti-discrimination law in the UK. While Hindu organizations in the UK reject “caste” as a colonial and racist term and deploy postcolonial scholarship to deny caste discrimination, Dalit organizations, representing its potential victims, turn to scholarly discourse on caste, race, or human rights to support their cause. These are epistemological disputes about categories of description and how “the social” is made available for public debate, and especially for law. Such disputes engage with anthropology, whose analytical terms animate and change the social world that is their subject.","[{""name"": ""David Mosse"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/187489209X437008"", ""10.1080/01419870.2013.858174"", ""10.1525/california/9780520253162.001.0001"", ""10.4135/9781446201077.n9"", ""10.1080/014198700328944"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-57119-9"", ""10.22582/am.v18i1.496"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198082965.001.0001"", ""10.1163/157181110X495926"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226152882.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jaarel/lfw031"", ""10.1017/S0010417512000606"", ""10.3138/9781442694934"", ""10.1177/0262728016663793"", ""10.1017/S1356186315000486"", ""10.1080/09584935.2018.1498453"", ""10.3167/fcl.2016.740109"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198099765.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1358229116655654"", ""10.1017/S0026749X15000037"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198524021.003.0012"", ""10.1163/9789004378865"", ""10.1017/S0010417515000043"", ""10.1177/0032329218776940"", ""10.1093/hrlr/ngu012"", ""10.1080/09584935.2017.1353587"", ""10.1146/annurev.anthro.34.081804.120649"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-38761-1"", ""10.1057/9781137501950_9"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.06.003"", ""10.1525/california/9780520288812.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0026749X20000414"", ""10.1525/9780520341630""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Anthropology', 'Philosophy', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1007/s11698-021-00237-2,CLIOMETRICA,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,On the origins of the demographic transition: rethinking the European marriage pattern,"AbstractWhy did France experience the demographic transition first? This question remains one of the greatest puzzles of economics, demography, and economic history. The French pattern is hard to reconcile with elucidations of the process as found in other countries. The present analysis goes back to the roots of the process and offers novel ways of explaining why people started to control their fertility in France and how they did so. In this paper, I track the evolution of marriage patterns to a point before the premises of the demographic transition. I identify two distinct phases. Next, I rely on exploratory methods to classify French counties based on their discriminatory features. Five profiles emerge. I discuss these profiles through the lens of the French Revolution, one of the greatest events that ever occurred in French history, which irretrievably altered its society. In particular, the results show that the fertility transition was not as linear, but more complex than previous research had argued. They show the importance of accounting for cultural factors and for individuals’ predispositions to adapt more or less quickly to societal changes. Yet cultural factors are not all. They can help to explain the timing of the transition and the choice of methods used to control fertility, but modernity and gender equality are also needed to describe the mechanisms in play behind the process.","[{""name"": ""Faustine Perrin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3406/ahrf.2005.2750"", ""10.2307/1859051"", ""10.1007/s10887-010-9052-z"", ""10.1257/jel.53.4.898"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt005"", ""10.1177/036319909101600101"", ""10.1017/S1365100509090403"", ""10.1353/dem.2006.0030"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99480-2_6"", ""10.2307/1972899"", ""10.1162/003355300554953"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3702670"", ""10.3406/adh.1998.2145"", ""10.1007/s11698-017-0166-9"", ""10.1080/00324728.1966.10406092"", ""10.1016/j.hisfam.2011.08.002"", ""10.1017/S0022050716000474"", ""10.1108/S0363-3268(2013)0000029005"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198286592.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2012.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.07.001"", ""10.1007/s10887-019-09170-6"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00483.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99480-2_7"", ""10.1017/S0022050714000564"", ""10.1016/S1081-602X(96)90003-2"", ""10.3406/ahrf.1977.1007"", ""10.1484/M.CORN-EB.4.00125"", ""10.1257/aer.103.3.545"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-44651-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99480-2_2"", ""10.1093/ereh/hex008"", ""10.7202/1011925ar"", ""10.1080/20780389.2015.1109440"", ""10.1111/j.1944-8287.2008.01002.x"", ""10.3406/ahrf.2006.2905"", ""10.4000/lrf.1071"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2011.01.002"", ""10.1023/A:1006032332021"", ""10.1162/003355302320935007"", ""10.1257/aer.90.4.806"", ""10.1111/j.1467-937X.2008.00506.x"", ""10.3917/puf.dupaq.1988.01.0117"", ""10.4000/books.pupo.2901"", ""10.3917/arco.godin.2015.01"", ""10.1257/000282806777212602"", ""10.2307/203725"", ""10.2307/1972376"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2011.07.001"", ""10.2307/1531717"", ""10.2307/1531570"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2016.03.001"", ""10.3406/adh.1996.1926"", ""10.1016/B978-044452701-1.00064-8"", ""10.4000/lrf.1458"", ""10.2307/3349375"", ""10.3406/adh.1989.1705"", ""10.1017/dem.2020.34"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99480-2_9"", ""10.3406/ahess.1979.294052"", ""10.1007/s11698-011-0071-6"", ""10.1093/qje/qjv025"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99480-2_5"", ""10.4324/9780203643297"", ""10.3406/comm.1986.1653"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190847883.001.0001"", ""10.4000/eps.5666"", ""10.1007/s10887-006-9007-6"", ""10.1257/aer.103.6.2227"", ""10.1080/03071027708567400"", ""10.1017/S0022050700031351""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

In the context of colonial Northern Nigeria, this sacred-secular entanglement, which took the form of the co-option of Islam for the colonial ‘secular’ enterprise, did not leave Islam unchanged. Co-opting Islam for the colonial project necessitated the making of an Islamic Law amenable to the colonial state. With a focus on criminal law, this article narrates the making of a British Colonial Islamic law in Northern Nigeria through the unprecedented expansion of siyasa. Departing from orthodox accounts of Islamic law's reification in colonial Northern Nigeria and heterodox assertions of its erosion by the colonial state, this article argues that neither the reification nor the erosion accounts illuminates the relationship between the colonial state and Islamic law. To show how the colonial state could assert secularism while co-opting Islam, this article presents a narrative of reform that foregrounds the following questions: Who had (and exercised) the power to decide what Islamic law was? How was the exercise of this power justified? How did the exercise of this power fit with the broader colonial project of governing religious difference? What were the consequences of these processes for Islamic law, institutions and colonial subjects?","[{""name"": ""Rabiat Akande"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0010417510000289"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226248646.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020743813001542"", ""10.1017/S0738248014000479"", ""10.1017/S0026749X01002013"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139013413"", ""10.1525/california/9780520293779.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199995431.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226323480.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315032719"", ""10.1515/9781400843480"", ""10.1017/S0738248014000467"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77k82"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691165158.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400835072"", ""10.1093/iclq/51.4.817"", ""10.1111/j.1749-8171.2010.00246.x"", ""10.1525/california/9780520205406.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9780804783095"", ""10.3167/sa.2009.530112"", ""10.1515/9781400842605"", ""10.1111/j.1747-4469.2001.tb00180.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226369174.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139199247"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190697624.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0041977X00124061"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2230.1961.tb02191.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2230.1961.tb02193.x"", ""10.1017/S0010417500003558"", ""10.1515/9780748637942-007"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511610677"", ""10.2307/1051107""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

This article places Locke's intervention in the context of the postrevolutionary English state at war and reads his monetary pamphlets as an integral, if largely neglected, part of his political philosophy. Instead of taking Locke's insistence on “intrinsick value” itself at face value, I argue that it was precisely money's fragile conventionality that threatened its role as a societal bond of trust. In response to this fragility and corruptibility, Locke tied money by fiat to an initially arbitrary but unalterable quantity of metal. While Locke's argument contributed to the modern naturalization of money, it arose from a paradoxical political act of monetary depoliticization.","[{""name"": ""STEFAN EICH"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4159/9780674972728-006"", ""10.2307/1915650"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521383714.002"", ""10.1515/9781400851621"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226577036.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139644587"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190637293.003.0003"", ""10.1017/S0265052500004477"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558641"", ""10.4159/9780674286177"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511810268.011"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226480473.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1747-4469.2005.tb00345.x"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674062665"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199589777.001.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520957572"", ""10.1017/9781316160800"", ""10.1017/S1479244311000588"", ""10.1080/09608780701604971"", ""10.1017/S0034670510000859"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198279679.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511621994.006"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511810251"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625077"", ""10.1215/00182702-1504086"", ""10.1093/past/71.1.43"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490484"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625534.015"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2010.00878.x"", ""10.1163/9789004353671_007"", ""10.4159/9780674970342"", ""10.1017/S0007680517001064"", ""10.1515/9781400827701"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190211615.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139171144"", ""10.1177/0090591704267122"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598531""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

While much research has focused on the socioeconomic integration of immigrants there has been less interest in their demographic integration, even though this can tell us as much about the way immigrants fare in their new home country. In this article we study the disparities in infant and child mortality across nativity groups and generations, using new, high-density census data. In addition to describing differentials and trends in child mortality among 14 immigrant groups relative to the native-born white population of native parentage, we focus special attention on the association between child mortality, immigrant assimilation, and the community-level context of where immigrants lived. Our findings indicate substantial nativity differences in child mortality, but also that factors related to the societal integration of immigrants explains a substantial part of these differentials. Our results also point to the importance of spatial patterns and contextual variables in understanding nativity differentials in child mortality.","[{""name"": ""Martin Dribe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J.

In Ukraine, the Holodomor (death by hunger) occupies a prominent place in the public sphere and is remembered most frequently as a genocidal policy against the Ukrainian nation. In Kazakhstan, the famine takes up little space in the public arena, and officials remain reluctant to call it a genocide. This article explores these differences using two models explaining variation in the politics of memory: one emphasizing the instrumental calculations of political elites and the other emphasizing the historical and cultural constraints that frame contemporary debates. These two models complement each other rather than compete. The contest over the famine in Ukraine was in part a consequence of eastern and western Ukraine’s differing histories, but it intensified when governing politicians deployed the memory of the famine instrumentally in the 2000s. In Kazakhstan, political calculations led the regime to emphasize unity and stability over divisive debates about the past, but historical factors made depoliticizing the famine feasible.","[{""name"": ""James Richter"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4159/harvard.9780674061262"", ""10.1353/kri.2013.0025"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801453915.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9786155211355"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801452192.001.0001"", ""10.21226/T2T59X"", ""10.1080/00905992.2016.1158157"", ""10.1515/9786155211188"", ""10.1057/9780230116429_5"", ""10.1080/00905992.2017.1288204"", ""10.1080/1464936042000252778"", ""10.1080/13600820903432027"", ""10.1080/00905990802373603"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199375134.001.0001"", ""10.1353/wp.2007.0015"", ""10.4324/9780203014899"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1452181"", ""10.3138/9781442621435"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-19386-8"", ""10.1080/00085006.2011.11092673"", ""10.1177/0888325410387646"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1451232"", ""10.1093/0199241198.001.0001"", ""10.7591/9781501713323"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199375134.003.0008"", ""10.1080/14608944.2011.591373""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Ebola in 2014–15 drew international response, but was contained within the Upper West African region. COVID-19 reached Sierra Leone in April 2020 as part of a global pandemic. Local social knowledge has been an important factor in shaping responses to both diseases. In the case of Ebola, infection was concentrated in families, and responders needed a good knowledge of family interactional dynamics. COVID-19 is a more public disease. Responders have to assess risk factors in workplaces, markets, and places of worship. Comparing and contrasting the two cases also draws attention to different aspects of the historical context. Ebola response indexes Sierra Leone’s history as a humanitarian project associated with the abolition of the slave trade. The pandemic challenge of COVID-19 draws attention to Sierra Leone’s nodal position within a global diaspora rooted in Atlantic slavery and emancipation. Responders are forced to consider the ways in which the two infections articulate different aspects of calls for global social justice.","[{""name"": ""Paul Richards"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Medicine', 'Mathematics', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Modeling and Simulation']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)]]"

Roughly, the idea is to generalize binary state assertions to real-valued expectations, which can measure expected values of probabilistic program quantities. While loop-free programs can be analyzed by mechanically transforming expectations, verifying loops usually requires finding an invariant expectation, a difficult task.We propose a new view of invariant expectation synthesis as a regression problem: given an input state, predict the average value of the post-expectation in the output distribution. Guided by this perspective, we develop the first data-driven invariant synthesis method for probabilistic programs. Unlike prior work on probabilistic invariant inference, our approach can learn piecewise continuous invariants without relying on template expectations. We also develop a data-driven approach to learn sub-invariants from data, which can be used to upper- or lower-bound expected values. We implement our approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of benchmarks from the probabilistic programming literature.","[{""name"": ""Jialu Bao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nitesh Trivedi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Drashti Pathak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Justin Hsu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Subhajit Roy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_1"", ""10.1145/3434333"", ""10.1145/3158146"", ""10.1007/3-540-63165-8_199"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31784-3_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_28"", ""10.1145/3434320"", ""10.1145/2509136.2509546"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10936-7_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_1"", ""10.1145/2837614.2837639"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_44"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_31"", ""10.1007/3-540-07994-7_51"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2007.01.015"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_26"", ""10.1007/3-540-45251-6_29"", ""10.1145/2914770.2837664"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-40196-1_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49498-1_15"", ""10.5555/3329995.3330088"", ""10.1016/0022-0000(81)90036-2"", ""10.1016/0022-0000(85)90012-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17465-1_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_47"", ""10.1145/3533767.3534381"", ""10.1007/b138392"", ""10.1145/3158121"", ""10.1145/3385412.3385967"", ""10.1145/229542.229547"", ""10.1109/SP40001.2021.00060"", ""10.5555/3327757.3327873"", ""10.1145/3290352"", ""10.1007/s10009-012-0249-7"", ""10.1145/3453483.3454062"", ""10.1145/3192366.3192408""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

Mainstream approaches in this space suffer from various limitations, some stemming from the fact that they treat resources as undifferentiated entities grouped into resource pools. These approaches assume that all resources in a pool have the same performance and share the same availability calendars. Previous studies have acknowledged these assumptions, without quantifying their impact on simulation model accuracy. This paper addresses this gap in the context of simulation models automatically discovered from event logs. The paper proposes a simulation approach and a method for discovering simulation models, wherein each resource is treated as an individual entity, with its own performance and availability calendar. An evaluation shows that simulation models with differentiated resources more closely replicate the distributions of cycle times and the work rhythm in a process than models with undifferentiated resources.","[{""name"": ""Orlenys López-Pintado"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marlon Dumas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-45100-3_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-00416-2_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-93931-5_15"", ""10.1016/S0925-7721(98)00028-5"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2020.113284"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-07472-1_4"", ""10.1016/j.datak.2021.101897"", ""10.1007/3-540-45244-3_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-42887-1_21"", ""10.1007/s12599-015-0410-4"", ""10.1016/j.is.2019.101463"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31069-0_31"", ""10.1016/j.is.2008.09.002"", ""10.1007/11431855_16""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Management Information Systems', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

Evidence from 60 Million English Death and Probate Records, 1892-1992","This article analyzes a newly constructed individual level dataset of every English death and probate from 1892–1992. This analysis shows that the twentieth century’s “Great Equalization” of wealth stalled in mid-century. The probate rate, which captures the proportion of English holding any significant wealth at death rose from 10 percent in the 1890s to 40 percent by 1950 and has stagnated to 1992. Despite the large declines in the wealth share of the top 1 percent, from 73 to 20 percent, the median English individual died with almost nothing throughout. All changes in inequality after 1950 involve a reshuffling of wealth within the top 30 percent.

The CHERI project has proposed extending conventional architectures with hardware-supported capabilities to enable fine-grained memory protection and scalable compartmentalisation, allowing historically memory-unsafe C and C++ to be adapted to deterministically mitigate large classes of vulnerabilities, while requiring only minor changes to existing system software sources. Arm is currently designing and building Morello, a CHERI-enabled prototype architecture, processor, SoC, and board, extending the high-performance Neoverse N1, to enable industrial evaluation of CHERI and pave the way for potential mass-market adoption. However, for such a major new security-oriented architecture feature, it is important to establish high confidence that it does provide the intended protections, and that cannot be done with conventional engineering techniques.In this paper we put the Morello architecture on a solid mathematical footing from the outset. We define the fundamental security property that Morello aims to provide, reachable capability monotonicity, and prove that the architecture definition satisfies it. This proof is mechanised in Isabelle/HOL, and applies to a translation of the official Arm specification of the Morello instruction-set architecture (ISA) into Isabelle. The main challenge is handling the complexity and scale of a production architecture: 62,000 lines of specification, translated to 210,000 lines of Isabelle. We do so by factoring the proof via a narrow abstraction capturing essential properties of arbitrary CHERI ISAs, expressed above a monadic intra-instruction semantics. We also develop a model-based test generator, which generates instruction-sequence tests that give good specification coverage, used in early testing of the Morello implementation and in Morello QEMU development, and we use Arm’s internal test suite to validate our model.This gives us machine-checked mathematical proofs of whole-ISA security properties of a full-scale industry architecture, at design-time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that that is feasible, and it significantly increases confidence in Morello.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Bauereiss"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Brian Campbell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas Sewell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alasdair Armstrong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lawrence Esswood"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ian Stark"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Graeme Barnes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Robert N.

Politicians stressed the importance of a shared historical memory to Russian national identity, rendering the interpretation of history a question of patriotism. The government and state-supportive media then used “patriotic” historical memories to legitimize government policies. Through framing analysis of three significant episodes—namely, the Ukraine Crisis, imposition of sanctions, and Russian intervention in Syria—I outline how the government and state-supportive media conflated these events with supposed historical precedents. This conflation made “patriotic” (or government-approved) history an everyday topic of discussion, but it also confused supporting government policy with celebrating historical triumph (or condemning historical tragedy). In this way, the government co-opted the emotional power of the history they invoked for the purposes of legitimizing their policies. This was compounded by the government and state-supportive media using and citing images and descriptions of ordinary people performing their patriotism in a manner that simultaneously demonstrated awareness of Russian history and support for the government.","[{""name"": ""Jade McGlynn"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/2451-8921-00104005"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2015.07.006"", ""10.4324/9780429426773"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2016.1200797"", ""10.1057/9780230353893"", ""10.1080/00905992.2015.1013527"", ""10.4324/9780429318931"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-78589-9_3"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474433853.003.0012"", ""10.1353/imp.2013.0000"", ""10.1177/089443939701500403"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2015.1076959"", ""10.1080/00905992.2017.1339678"", ""10.1111/j.1467-954X.2012.02073.x"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0006"", ""10.1016/j.euras.2012.03.004"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474433853.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203846643"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12188"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2017.1355716"", ""10.1080/00905992.2014.917075"", ""10.1177/0010414016688005"", ""10.1177/0020702017692609"", ""10.1163/187633211X591175"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7_7"", ""10.1016/j.ruslit.2018.05.009"", ""10.1080/15205436.2015.1068811"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-43201-4"", ""10.21825/snm.85398"", ""10.1080/09668136.2017.1374353"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0069""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

By comparing previous cases of removals of pro-Kurdish mayors to post-2016 practices, it argues that the discursive shift in legitimizing recent anti-democratic governmental practices should be read in relation to authoritarian neoliberalism in Turkey. To this end, it analyzes a Twitter account dedicated to promoting public services of trustee-ran municipalities (oluyor.net) and 89 YouTube videos that feature the trustees themselves. By demonstrating the ways in which the trustees themselves promote their work in Kurdish-populated cities, it underlines the dangers of authoritarian neoliberalism in subordinating democratic mechanisms to economic development and providing better public services. However, by studying the results of the following 2019 local elections in these 89 trustee-appointed municipalities, this article shows that the local people mostly continue supporting democratic mechanisms by electing pro-Kurdish candidates even in unfair electoral conditions.","[{""name"": ""Serhat Tutkal"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0896920516668386"", ""10.2307/3540539"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1712455"", ""10.1080/19448953.2018.1497755"", ""10.1080/2158379X.2017.1335838"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01108-6_7"", ""10.1177/0010414020926199"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0066"", ""10.1111/nana.12383"", ""10.1080/03056244.2014.988698"", ""10.1080/13510347.2020.1751615"", ""10.1080/13510347.2020.1803841"", ""10.1080/14683857.2016.1242891"", ""10.1080/19448953.2020.1801245"", ""10.1057/9780230103320_2"", ""10.5129/001041517820201378"", ""10.1111/jssr.12652"", ""10.1515/9781400826872.37"", ""10.1080/02723638.2018.1440125"", ""10.1080/02666959108716214"", ""10.2202/1938-2545.1002"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000253"", ""10.1080/08935696.2013.843250"", ""10.1525/001c.11872"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226320519.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020743800057123"", ""10.1017/gov.2016.41"", ""10.7312/brow19384"", ""10.1177/002200947100600105"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1330486"", ""10.1080/2201473X.2016.1199826"", ""10.1080/13530194.2019.1634394"", ""10.1080/17526272.2017.1315702"", ""10.1177/1354068820923722"", ""10.1177/1078087420957736"", ""10.1017/S1537592719000434"", ""10.1017/S1537592718003377"", ""10.1111/anti.12651"", ""10.33182/ks.v7i1.507"", ""10.1163/157181399400838968"", ""10.2307/3540782"", ""10.33182/ks.v3i1.390"", ""10.1080/13608746.2014.979031"", ""10.1080/14747731.2018.1502494"", ""10.1080/13608746.2018.1480332"", ""10.1007/s10624-013-9297-y"", ""10.1177/0304375419854599"", ""10.1017/S1537592717002183"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.1995.tb01375.x"", ""10.1080/19436149.2016.1218162"", ""10.1177/1750635220925844"", ""10.1080/17449057.2017.1339425"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-78346-8_4"", ""10.33182/ks.v5i2.441"", ""10.1080/13608746.2018.1479945"", ""10.1080/13510347.2019.1658744"", ""10.1080/13608746.2019.1691318"", ""10.1080/00472336.2018.1446546""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

In such systems, every state may be associated with a risk, e.g., the probability of an imminent crash. During runtime, we obtain partial information about the system state in form of observations. The monitor uses this information to estimate the risk of the (unobservable) current system state. Our results are threefold. First, we show that extensions of state estimation approaches do not scale due the combination of nondeterminism and probabilities. While exploiting a geometric interpretation of the state estimates improves the practical runtime, this cannot prevent an exponential memory blowup. Second, we present a tractable algorithm based on model checking conditional reachability probabilities.

It argues that in becoming a nation-state Belarus has faced challenges similar to the other post-Soviet nations but has proved an exception in the choice of strategies it used to address them. The paper examines how, on the eve of independence, the nationalist elites devised policies aimed at consolidating statehood around the national revival in opposition to the Soviet past. It explores the role played by linguistic policy and historical memory as the two main arenas for implementing their visions of Belarusian identity. The paper then maps a shift in this trajectory from Lukashenka’s rise to power to a national project based on reappropriation of Soviet legacy. Up until 2020, the state effectively navigated a geopolitical environment and adjusted its sociocultural parameters to preempt the society’s shifting expectations. Finally, the paper reflects on how protests in 2020 demonstrated both the lack of support for Lukashenka and his reliance on the violent repression and external support for remaining in power. The war in Ukraine revealed limits of Belarus’s sovereignty, while the society’s ability to consolidate for its defense has been seriously undermined by the repression.","[{""name"": ""Nelly Bekus"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/03058298050330031701"", ""10.1515/9786155225475"", ""10.1080/0955757042000245924"", ""10.4324/9780203737910"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190457204.003.0019"", ""10.1017/nps.2021.33"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558764"", ""10.1177/1354066196002002001"", ""10.5612/slavicreview.71.3.0619"", ""10.1017/slr.2021.21"", ""10.1017/slr.2021.28"", ""10.2747/1539-7216.53.5.553"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12620"", ""10.1177/2336825X20984340"", ""10.1080/09668136.2018.1555796"", ""10.1177/0888325417741343"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8675.2009.00527.x"", ""10.1057/9781137376343"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtq021"", ""10.1080/09668136.2017.1350259"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66523-8"", ""10.1017/slr.2021.25"", ""10.2307/2928520"", ""10.2307/2096461"", ""10.2307/j.ctv8pzbhw.18"", ""10.2307/3032805"", ""10.1177/0888325418791725""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

However, there are properties that cannot be immediately proved by means of logical relations, for instance program continuity and differentiability in higher-order languages extended with real-valued functions. Informally, the problem stems from the fact that these properties are naturally expressed on terms of non-ground type (or, equivalently, on open terms of base type), and there is no apparent good definition for a base case (i.e. for closed terms of ground types). To overcome this issue, we study a generalization of the concept of a logical relation, calledopen logical relation, and prove that it can be fruitfully applied in several contexts in which the property of interest is about expressions of first-order type. Our setting is a simply-typed$$\lambda $$λ-calculus enriched with real numbers and real-valued first-order functions from a given set, such as the one of continuous or differentiable functions. We first prove a containment theorem stating that for any collection of real-valued first-order functions including projection functions and closed under function composition, any well-typed term of first-order type denotes a function belonging to that collection. Then, we show by way of open logical relations the correctness of the core of a recently published algorithm for forward automatic differentiation. Finally, we define a refinement-based type system for local continuity in an extension of our calculus with conditionals, and prove the soundness of the type system using open logical relations.","[{""name"": ""Gilles Barthe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raphaëlle Crubillé"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ugo Dal Lago"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Francesco Gavazzo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3371106"", ""10.1007/11693024_6"", ""10.1145/504709.504712"", ""10.1145/1190215.1190235"", ""10.1016/S0377-0427(00)00422-2"", ""10.1145/2578855.2535869"", ""10.1145/3158096"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2016.04.003"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46678-0_18"", ""10.1145/2858949.2784733"", ""10.1145/3371132"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.23.3"", ""10.1145/1707801.1706308"", ""10.1145/2240236.2240262"", ""10.1145/2025113.2025131"", ""10.1112/plms/s1-4.1.381"", ""10.1109/SFCS.1989.63471"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2007.02.010"", ""10.1017/S095679681200024X"", ""10.1016/S1571-0661(05)80040-4"", ""10.1145/3236765"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2008.12.003"", ""10.1145/571157.571161"", ""10.1145/113445.113468"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-37075-5_22"", ""10.1016/S0049-237X(08)70843-7"", ""10.1007/3-540-45793-3_37"", ""10.1137/1.9780898717761"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45231-5_17"", ""10.1145/3371127"", ""10.1007/BFb0037110"", ""10.1137/S0097539794263452"", ""10.1017/S095679681900008X"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49498-1_23"", ""10.1145/1190215.1190242"", ""10.1145/1330017.1330018"", ""10.1007/3-540-57182-5_8"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4943.003.0042"", ""10.1145/3341701"", ""10.1007/s10990-008-9037-1"", ""10.1145/2933575.2935313"", ""10.2307/2271658"", ""10.1007/BFb0064875"", ""10.1145/2480359.2429111"", ""10.1109/12.57047"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-56999-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-17164-2_24""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Decisive for its successful implementation were two factors: the growing scale of mass violence against civilians during the Second World War, and the strong support and advocacy of “peripheral actors,” jurists forced into exile in London by the war. These jurists included representatives of smaller Allied countries from around the world, who used the commission's work to push for a codification of international law, which finally materialized during the London Conference of August 1945. This article studies the process of mediation and the emergence of legal concepts. It thereby introduces the concept of “legal flows” to highlight the different strands and older traditions of humanitarian law involved in coining new law. The experience of exile is shown to have had a significant constitutive function in the globalization of a concept (that of “crimes against humanity”).","[{""name"": ""KERSTIN VON LINGEN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9780230604285"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139236980"", ""10.13109/9783666101458.187"", ""10.1080/14623520500349902"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199653072.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ehr/CVII.423.323"", ""10.7312/moyn16048"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976537"", ""10.1524/9783486713701"", ""10.4000/monderusse.9133"", ""10.1525/9780520936126"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195176155.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2555232"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139032940"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139015424"", ""10.1080/14623528.2013.821224"", ""10.9783/9780812207781"", ""10.1007/s10609-014-9225-0"", ""10.2307/2187932"", ""10.1515/9781400831661"", ""10.56021/9780801854576"", ""10.30965/9783657763993"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490439.007"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199660285.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511723278"", ""10.1086/ahr.113.3.701"", ""10.1017/S0960777305002730""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Due to advances in research and strong demand for solvers, there are many SMT solvers available. Since different implementations have different strengths, it is often desirable to be able to substitute one solver by another. Unfortunately, the solvers have vastly different APIs and it is not easy to switch to a different solver (lock-in effect). To tackle this problem, we developed JavaSMT, which is a solver-independent framework that unifies the API for using a set of SMT solvers. This paper describes version 3 of JavaSMT, which now supports eight SMT solvers and offers a simpler build and update process. Our feature comparisons and experiments show that different SMT solvers significantly differ in terms of feature support and performance characteristics. A unifying Java API for SMT solvers is important to make the SMT technology accessible for software developers. Similar APIs exist for other programming languages.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Baier"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karlheinz Friedberger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5281/zenodo.4708050"", ""10.5281/zenodo.4865175"", ""10.1007/3-540-45319-9_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_11"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2004.1317455"", ""10.1109/FMCAD.2009.5351147"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_42"", ""10.1007/s10817-017-9432-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16"", ""10.3233/SAT190039"", ""10.1007/3-540-49059-0_14"", ""10.1016/S0065-2458(03)58003-2"", ""10.1145/3136000.3136004"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31759-0_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-20398-5_36"", ""10.2307/2963593"", ""10.1109/ICTAI.2019.00013"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-23702-7_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_49"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24605-3_37"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_19"", ""10.1007/3-540-63166-6_10"", ""10.1145/964001.964021"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106983"", ""10.1145/1592434.1592438"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_15"", ""10.1145/3331076.3331105"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48869-1_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.3233/sat190101"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_32"", ""10.1007/3-540-45949-9"", ""10.1007/s10009-016-0426-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-89439-1_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_27"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02777-2_24"", ""10.1145/3377024.3377036""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

Members of the Cambridge school eschewed the term “capitalism” as an anachronistic description of the contexts that informed early modern politico-economic thought, preferring instead the ostensibly more neutral “commercial society.” But Hont's understanding of the latter was nevertheless quite present-minded and politically charged. Hont drove nineteenth- and twentieth-century economic theory back into eighteenth-century models, and his view of the economy that gave rise to them was informed by concerns in the 1980s and 1990s over the competitiveness of advanced capitalist nations in the face of low-cost insurgents such as China. More deliberate choices of recent economic theory can produce more accurate alternatives to the supposedly neutral “commercial society” depicted by Hont. World systems and dependency theory may help us to better understand the economic thought produced in and about the specifically capitalist world economy of the early modern period.","[{""name"": ""Paul Cheney"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2589870"", ""10.1017/9781108241410"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674063235"", ""10.1093/past/103.1.131"", ""10.4159/9780674243095"", ""10.1017/S1740022818000372"", ""10.1017/S0022050710000598"", ""10.1017/S0022050716000553"", ""10.2307/j.ctt227274m"", ""10.4159/9780674286177"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-3936-7"", ""10.1080/095023898335627"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-86082-1"", ""10.1086/683036"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511735073"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00540.x"", ""10.1017/S0047160700008751"", ""10.1093/ahr/122.5.1431"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490705"", ""10.1017/S1361491602000023"", ""10.2307/2650569"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226651866.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ahr/120.2.564"", ""10.1093/past/108.1.133"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511607882""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

This precludes many real protocols to be represented by MPST. To overcome these bottlenecks of MPST, we explore a new technique using weak bisimilarity between global types and endpoint types, which guarantees deadlock-freedom and absence of protocol violations. Based on a process algebraic framework, we present well-formed conditions for global types that guarantee weak bisimilarity between a global type and its endpoint types and prove their check is decidable. Our main practical result, obtained through benchmarks, is that our well-formedness conditions can be checked orders of magnitude faster than directly checking weak bisimilarity using a state-of-the-art model checker.","[{""name"": ""Sung-Shik Jongmans"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nobuko Yoshida"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1561/2500000031"", ""10.1017/S0960129508007111"", ""10.1016/B978-044482830-9/50023-0"", ""10.1016/S0019-9958(84)80025-X"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-67113-0_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-44584-6_29"", ""10.1145/322374.322380"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2017.07.010"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17465-1_2"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2014.07.005"", ""10.1017/S0960129514000619"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15375-4_17"", ""10.1145/2480359.2429101"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-01918-0_5"", ""10.2168/LMCS-8(1:24)2012"", ""10.1007/s00165-016-0381-3"", ""10.1145/3290342"", ""10.1017/S0960129514000188"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_15"", ""10.1145/3158661"", ""10.1145/1925844.1926435"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28869-2_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39212-2_18"", ""10.2168/LMCS-8(4:6)2012"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-27705-4_21"", ""10.1007/s00450-016-0334-3"", ""10.1145/3060140"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9946.001.0001"", ""10.26226/morressier.604907f51a80aac83ca25d9e"", ""10.1145/2807591.2807644"", ""10.1007/BFb0057019"", ""10.1145/1328897.1328472"", ""10.1145/2827695"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49665-7_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54494-5_7"", ""10.1145/2873052"", ""10.26226/morressier.604907f41a80aac83ca25d47"", ""10.1145/3180155.3180157"", ""10.1145/2775051.2676964"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54458-7_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-00590-9_23"", ""10.1007/s00165-017-0420-8"", ""10.1145/3178372.3179495"", ""10.1145/3033019.3033031"", ""10.1007/s11761-014-0172-8"", ""10.1145/3290343"", ""10.1145/3337932.3338812"", ""10.1145/3314221.3322484""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"
10.1017/jbr.2021.185,JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES,0603 World History,"Colonial Petitions, Colonial Petitioners, and the Imperial Parliament, ca. 1780-1918","AbstractPetitioning was a common form of protest, request, or expression across the British Empire, and historians of colonial rule and resistance have often drawn on petitions as sources to investigate particular controversies. This article assesses the significance, variety, and context of petitioning to the Imperial Parliament from both the British Isles and the colonies. To do so, we present new data drawn from more than one million petitions sent to the House of Commons in the period from 1780 to 1918, alongside qualitative research into a wider range of petitions to other metropolitan sources of authority. This range permits us to assess how colonial subjects across the empire demanded attention from Westminster and what the practice of petitioning reveals about the British self-image of parliamentary scrutiny and equality before the law.","[{""name"": ""Richard Huzzey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henry Miller"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199233014.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316104392"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00012166"", ""10.1080/03086534.2012.697612"", ""10.1017/ssh.2019.23"", ""10.1017/ssh.2019.17"", ""10.4159/9780674972780"", ""10.2307/4129041"", ""10.1017/ssh.2019.19"", ""10.1080/03086530802561040"", ""10.1515/9780773568457"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139022026"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511635526.003"", ""10.1017/S0010417506000260"", ""10.1017/S0022278X00018590"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801451089.003.0006"", ""10.1177/0376983613499681"", ""10.9783/9780812202427"", ""10.1093/pa/gss005"", ""10.1111/1750-0206.12449"", ""10.1017/jbr.2015.176"", ""10.1017/9781107337787"", ""10.1017/9781316027035"", ""10.1093/hwj/54.1.24"", ""10.2307/3172106"", ""10.1017/S0026749X17000944"", ""10.2307/743602"", ""10.1017/jbr.2013.210"", ""10.1017/jbr.2013.211"", ""10.1111/1468-229X.13103"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199584734.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805363"", ""10.1080/03057070500202162"", ""10.3138/9781442688544"", ""10.1080/03086530801889400"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199551941.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1479244306001028"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77c6d"", ""10.1080/0144039X.2019.1614324"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300214246.001.0001"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719097010.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0026749X17001135"", ""10.17159/2309-8392/2018/v63n1a1"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtz061"", ""10.1017/jbr.2013.213"", ""10.1080/03086534.2012.730835""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

We provide a framework to systematically increase the precision of clustered relational analyses by splitting control locations based on abstractions of local traces. As one instance, we obtain an analysis of dynamic thread creation and joining. Interestingly, tracking less relational information for globals may result in higher precision. We consider the class of 2-decomposable domains that encompasses many weakly relational domains (e.g., Octagons). For these domains, we prove that maximal precision is attained already for clusters of globals of sizes at most 2.","[{""name"": ""Michael Schwarz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simmo Saan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Helmut Seidl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julian Erhard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vesal Vojdani"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/1229428.1229471"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-30793-5_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-48288-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-35182-2_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-94583-1_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69330-7_11"", ""10.1145/781131.781153"", ""10.1145/267896.267921"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52234-0_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10936-7_7"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.129.19"", ""10.1145/567752.567778"", ""10.1007/s10703-009-0089-6"", ""10.1145/3290355"", ""10.1145/512760.512770"", ""10.1109/ICPP.2015.98"", ""10.1145/195274.195295"", ""10.1145/2103656.2103693"", ""10.1016/j.jlap.2004.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2010.09.006"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(98)00194-7"", ""10.1007/s10703-006-0013-2"", ""10.1007/3-540-44898-5_20"", ""10.1007/3-540-49727-7_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-53413-7_12"", ""10.1145/567446.567454"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-04761-9_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02658-4_52"", ""10.1007/BF00268497"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950291"", ""10.1145/3106237.3106243"", ""10.1145/1363686.1363736"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-31987-0_2"", ""10.1007/3-540-44978-7_10"", ""10.1109/WCRE.2001.957836"", ""10.1007/s10990-006-8609-1"", ""10.2168/LMCS-8(1:26)2012"", ""10.2168/LMCS-8(1:26)2012"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52234-0_21"", ""10.1145/3453483.3454057"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66706-5_13"", ""10.1007/3-540-48166-4_21"", ""10.1145/2590811"", ""10.1145/2821504"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69738-1_20"", ""10.1145/1275497.1275501"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-88806-0_18"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7505428"", ""10.1017/S0960129521000499"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-88806-0_19"", ""10.1007/3-540-45013-0_7"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009885"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_12"", ""10.1145/3158143"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02768-1_6"", ""10.1145/2970276.2970337"", ""10.1145/3168813""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

We perform these measurements from the homes of 2,693 participating panelists in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Measuring Broadband America program. We found that clients do not have to trade DNS performance for privacy. For certain resolvers, DoT was able to perform faster than DNS in median response times, even as latency increased. We also found significant variation in DoH performance across recursive resolvers. Based on these results, we recommend that DNS clients (e.g., web browsers) should periodically conduct simple latency and response time measurements to determine which protocol and resolver a client should use. No single DNS protocol nor resolver performed the best for all clients.","[{""name"": ""Austin Hounsel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paul Schmitt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kevin Borgolte"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nick Feamster"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3419394.3423659"", ""10.17487/RFC7626"", ""10.1145/3355369.3355575"", ""10.17487/RFC8484"", ""10.1145/3366423.3380139"", ""10.17487/RFC7858"", ""10.1145/1879141.1879173"", ""10.14722/ndss.2019.23386"", ""10.1145/3355369.3355580"", ""10.1145/2398776.2398831"", ""10.1145/2504730.2504741"", ""10.1109/sp.2015.18""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

The Long-Run Impact of Early Agriculture,"In this article we document a reversal of fortune within the Western agricultural core, showing that regions which made early transition to Neolithic agriculture are now poorer than regions that made the transition later. The finding contrasts recent influential works emphasizing the beneficial role of early transition. Using data from a large number of carbon-dated Neolithic sites throughout the Western agricultural area, we determine approximate transition dates for about 60 countries, 280 medium-sized regions, and 1,400 small regions. Our empirical analysis shows that there is a robust negative, reduced-form relationship between years since transition to agriculture and contemporary levels of income both across and within countries. Our results further indicate that the reversal had started to emerge already before the era of European colonization.","[{""name"": ""Ola Olsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Paik"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv1bvnfk9"", ""10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00084-0"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00461"", ""10.1111/0022-1082.00115"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000096"", ""10.1086/261959"", ""10.1515/9781400823499"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808678"", ""10.1126/science.169.3947.733"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2011.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2003.08.010"", ""10.1111/j.0950-0804.2005.00259.x"", ""10.1371/journal.pbio.0030410"", ""10.1111/j.1542-4774.2010.tb00511.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0335.2007.00652.x"", ""10.1162/qjec.2010.125.4.1627"", ""10.1257/0002828054201305"", ""10.1515/9781400853113"", ""10.1073/pnas.1002470107"", ""10.1017/9781139568272"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000561"", ""10.1016/j.jedc.2016.04.001"", ""10.1017/S0022050700009451"", ""10.1073/pnas.1212149110"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-023141"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-043014-105648"", ""10.1257/aer.101.5.2003"", ""10.1017/S0022050717000729"", ""10.1257/jel.51.2.325"", ""10.1093/restud/rds034"", ""10.1007/s10887-017-9152-0"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00284"", ""10.1353/wp.2006.0002"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.05.003"", ""10.1257/aer.103.1.1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Paleontology', 'Demography', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7076), ('0709 地质学', 0.7071)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1007/s11698-020-00201-6,CLIOMETRICA,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,"A ""Silent Revolution"": school reforms and Italy's educational gender gap in the Liberal Age (1861-1921)","AbstractThis paper explores the evolution of the human capital gender gap in Liberal Italy (1871–1921). First, we show that Italy lagged some 50 years behind more advanced countries like France, Prussia and the UK, and that the regional divide in gendered literacy was unparalleled in the rest of Europe. Next, we test whether the shift to primary-school centralization in 1911 (the Daneo-Credaro Reform) brought about a decisive improvement in female literacy. We rely on a brand new, cross-sectional micro (municipal)-dataset of literacy rates in 1911 and 1921, as well as their potential determinants around 1911. Such data, combined with propensity score matching to improve identification, show that primary-school centralization increased the average annual growth of female literacy by 0.78 percentage points. Thus, even though the Reform did not aim at girls specifically, it brought about the unintended consequences of more rapid human capital accumulation for women and—ceteris paribus—a reduced educational gender gap. We briefly discuss why this “Silent Revolution” likely had important implications for Italy’s economic history.","[{""name"": ""Gabriele Cappelli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michelangelo Vasta"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/pst.433"", ""10.2307/2937943"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199379231.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jeg/lbx033"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9442.2008.00561.x"", ""10.1080/01615440.2013.852370"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2015.09.002"", ""10.1257/aer.90.5.1160"", ""10.1007/s11698-015-0133-2"", ""10.1093/ereh/hev020"", ""10.1162/JINH_a_01014"", ""10.1111/ehr.12877"", ""10.1093/ereh/hey014"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99480-2_3"", ""10.1515/9781400827817"", ""10.3386/w18477"", ""10.2304/rcie.2006.1.1.3"", ""10.1257/aer.103.3.545"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99480-2_2"", ""10.1093/ereh/hex008"", ""10.1257/jel.50.4.1051"", ""10.3386/w9259"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000712"", ""10.1007/s11698-011-0076-1"", ""10.1093/ereh/heu018"", ""10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01004-X"", ""10.1016/j.ihe.2017.02.001"", ""10.3917/redp.276.1083"", ""10.1093/wber/lhf004"", ""10.1257/jel.39.4.1101"", ""10.1016/0304-3932(88)90168-7"", ""10.2307/2118477"", ""10.1007/s11698-018-0172-6"", ""10.1111/ehr.12087"", ""10.1093/ereh/hex006"", ""10.1111/roiw.12104"", ""10.1086/261725"", ""10.1093/biomet/70.1.41"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(00)00018-8"", ""10.1111/ehr.12101"", ""10.3368/jhr.50.2.301"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190847883.001.0001"", ""10.1371/annotation/5fa9cfb4-9964-4586-845d-d8205f318d68"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198287735.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/ssh.2021.16,SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY,0603 World History,Varieties of Social Democracy and Cooperativism: Explaining the Historical Divergence between Housing Regimes in Nordic and German-Speaking Countries,"AbstractThe historical-comparative study of social democracy and cooperative organization are the foster children of historical sociology. This article offers a first account of systematic ideological differences in social-democratic ideology regarding private ownership and different cooperative traditions in the housing sphere of Northern European and continental German-speaking countries. The long-run trajectory of housing welfare regimes in these two country groups has been one of divergence: Nordic countries have moved to Anglo-Saxon levels of high homeownership, high levels of mortgage indebtedness, and house price increases, whereas private tenancy, lower indebtedness, and lower price increases still characterize their German counterparts. Based on historical case studies of Germany and Norway, we argue that the divergence in these two countries can be understood by the different social-democratic and cooperative solutions to the urban housing question from the 1920s onward. Supported by a pro-ownership social democracy, Norway started to develop housing cooperatives of the owner cooperative type, whereas German social democracy was in favor of associations of the tenant cooperative type. The differential growth of these two types of cooperatives and disparities in social democratic party ideology contributed to the urban housing divergence between the two country groups that has been observed ever since. We argue, more generally, that varieties of social democracy and welfare-anticipating cooperative organizations are important in helping us understand the welfare differences between countries.","[{""name"": ""Sebastian Kohl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jardar Sørvoll"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1525/9780520312586"", ""10.1080/19491247.2017.1336876"", ""10.1080/02815737.1992.10801444"", ""10.7577/nova/temahefte/2006/1"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139237208"", ""10.1023/A:1007781600434"", ""10.1007/s10901-013-9383-0"", ""10.18261/issn.2535-5988-2019-02-02"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.2010.00906.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2867r6"", ""10.1177/009614427700400101"", ""10.4337/9781785360961.00012"", ""10.4324/9780203308554"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-17570-2"", ""10.1080/02815737.1992.10801445"", ""10.1057/cep.2008.13"", ""10.1080/02673039608720847"", ""10.1080/14036090510032727"", ""10.1177/000169930004300411"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1596421"", ""10.1177/0951692890002002001"", ""10.5040/9780755692682"", ""10.1093/epolic/eiv017"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511626784.002"", ""10.18261/issn.2464-3076-2017-01-03"", ""10.1257/aer.20150501"", ""10.1080/14036090903326437"", ""10.1177/0308275X18761960"", ""10.1080/02673030500290985"", ""10.1080/14616718.2013.872949"", ""10.1007/s10901-009-9177-6"", ""10.1080/14036096.2018.1467341"", ""10.6027/9789289341066-7-en"", ""10.1080/00420989320081861"", ""10.1017/S0003975615000132"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199216352.001.0001"", ""10.1080/02673037.2021.1900796"", ""10.1111/0018-2656.751999075"", ""10.18261/ISSN1504-3045-2013-04-05-07"", ""10.1515/9781400839124"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511586378"", ""10.1515/9781400835669"", ""10.1080/03468759108579218"", ""10.1080/02815737.1992.10801447"", ""10.1080/14616718.2016.1162078"", ""10.1017/S0003975605000044"", ""10.1080/10835547.2015.12092104"", ""10.1093/ser/mwy030"", ""10.1080/02673037.2015.1061107"", ""10.13109/9783666359675"", ""10.4324/9780203182260-14"", ""10.1080/03585522.2016.1182581"", ""10.4324/9781315628455"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-081715-074333"", ""10.1080/10511482.2020.1789889"", ""10.1080/14036090500375373""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"

Using new data, we characterize Pinochet’s privatizations in Chile and find that some firms were sold underpriced to politically connected buyers. These newly private firms benefited financially from the Pinochet regime. Once democracy arrived, they formed connections with the new government, financed political campaigns, and were more likely to appear in the Panama Papers. These findings reveal how dictatorships can influence young democracies using privatization reforms.","[{""name"": ""Felipe González"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mounu Prem"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Francisco Urzúa I"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2139/ssrn.2931602"", ""10.1111/1467-842X.00156"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2006.11.003"", ""10.1111/j.1741-6248.2007.00087.x"", ""10.1093/jleo/ewu003"", ""10.1162/003355399556250"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00473.x"", ""10.1016/j.jmoneco.2014.05.005"", ""10.1515/1935-1682.3272"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.01000.x"", ""10.1257/aer.102.7.3731"", ""10.1017/S0022109013000173"", ""10.2307/2556024"", ""10.1162/003465305775098224"", ""10.1111/jeea.12001"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2004.05.005"", ""10.1111/jofi.12483"", ""10.1016/0304-405X(94)90006-X"", ""10.1257/aer.98.1.267"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226092904.003.0003"", ""10.1257/jel.47.3.699"", ""10.1596/0-8213-2976-6"", ""10.1086/262042"", ""10.1093/qje/qjr030"", ""10.1162/003355300554836"", ""10.56021/9780801851575"", ""10.1093/restud/rdu001"", ""10.1257/aer.91.4.1095"", ""10.2307/1229501"", ""10.1111/1540-6261.00511"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2002.10.002"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000124"", ""10.1086/426036"", ""10.1007/s10887-020-09176-5"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhq072"", ""10.1093/afraf/100.398.117"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt012"", ""10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1403"", ""10.5040/9798400604959"", ""10.3982/ECTA14125"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2015.10.001"", ""10.1257/jel.39.2.321"", ""10.1162/qjec.2008.123.1.101"", ""10.2307/2235248"", ""10.1093/biomet/asn055"", ""10.1080/07350015.2016.1227711"", ""10.1007/BF00572515"", ""10.1093/rof/rfs039"", ""10.1257/jep.31.3.113"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2018.08.024"", ""10.1111/1467-9868.00293"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2017.11.005"", ""10.1093/qje/qju004"", ""10.1162/003355399556241"", ""10.1257/aer.20131031"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2014.08.006"", ""10.1515/9781400830213"", ""10.1162/003355305775097524"", ""10.2307/1556395"", ""10.1257/aer.104.4.1244"", ""10.1111/j.1542-4774.2010.01008.x"", ""10.1111/0022-1082.00150""]","['Social Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Accounting']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)]]"

One is the symbolic executor Slowbeast, which newly supports backward symbolic execution including its extension called loop folding. This technique can infer inductive invariants from backward symbolic execution states. Thanks to these invariants, Symbiotic 9 is able to produce non-trivial correctness witnesses, which is a feature that is missing in previous versions of Symbiotic. We have also extended forward symbolic execution in Slowbeast with a basic support for parallel programs. The second component with significant improvements is the instrumentation module. In particular, we have extended the static analysis of accesses to arrays with features designed for programs that manipulate C strings.Symbiotic 9 is the Overall winner of SV-COMP 2022. Moreover, it won also the categories MemSafety and SoftwareSystems, and placed third in FalsificationOverall.","[{""name"": ""Marek Chalupa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vincent Mihalkovič"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anna Řechtáčková"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lukáš Zaoral"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Strejček"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5959149"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58768-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_33"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5947909"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-88806-0_3"", ""10.1145/1542476.1542517"", ""10.1109/CGO.2004.1281665"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Software', 'Signal Processing']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7598), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7575)]]"

Scott. In the case of the early Chinese empires of Qin (221–207 BCE) and Han (202 BCE–220 CE), state-induced migration and settlement were key instruments of military control, administrative incorporation, economic intensification, and other processes connected with spatial distribution of state power. This article combines insights from transmitted texts, excavated documents, and archaeological evidence to explore factors and effects of migration in early Chinese empires, discussing the interconnection between state-organized resettlement and private migration as well as their embeddedness in the local geography. As the situation varies according to location, the present article introduces the approach and tests it on a case study, the Guanzhong metropolitan region.","[{""name"": ""Maxim Korolkov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anke Hein"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/156852080X00078"", ""10.1007/s12520-019-00938-w"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139034852.011"", ""10.2307/4135008"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0003275"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1bvnfk9.10"", ""10.1080/02549948.2003.11731400""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

In the same provinces, we observe larger investments in labor-saving machines, the entry of more firms into the industrial sector, and a larger expansion of the industrial and service workforces.","[{""name"": ""Nicola Bianchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michela Giorcelli"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1162/REST_a_00565"", ""10.3886/E167821V1"", ""10.1353/jhr.2014.0021"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_342371"", ""10.1214/aoms/1177730090"", ""10.2307/1344512"", ""10.1257/aer.20141707"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2010.07.004"", ""10.2307/2235566"", ""10.1093/qje/qjx037"", ""10.1257/000282802762024502"", ""10.1080/00401706.2013.806694"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511583728"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080218-025643"", ""10.1257/aer.20170619"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000216"", ""10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00084-0""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"
10.1017/S1479244318000537,MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY,0603 World History,"RAYMOND WILLIAMS'S ""STRUCTURE OF FEELING"" AND THE PROBLEM OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES IN BRITAIN, 1938-1961","This article traces a history of the literary critic and theorist Raymond Williams’s idea of the “structure of feeling”, the formation of which is situated within debates about the place of artistic and moral values in democratic politics during the 1940s and 1950s. It demonstrates that the “structure of feeling” was intended to circumvent an equation of collective normative legislation with totalitarianism in the early cultural Cold War, by conceiving the definition of values as a process upon which all individuals in a society were always, necessarily, engaged. In articulating this quasi-democratic account of the production of artistic and moral standards, Williams also sought to escape the various theories of “minority culture” that dominated literary and cultural criticism in mid-century Britain. However, his concept of the “structure of feeling” required him to maintain a privileged role for artistic and intellectual arbiters, which constrained his vision of a properly democratic culture. In conclusion, the article argues that the problem of “democratic values” that Williams addressed in his work of the 1950s was a major factor in the marginalization or exclusion of moral criticism from political argument in Britain after 1945, and suggests that this passage of intellectual history may therefore be of considerable importance to contemporary debates about the lineages and reform of, in a broad sense, neoliberal political economy.","[{""name"": ""STUART MIDDLETON"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199587650.001.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520939790"", ""10.1038/148270a0"", ""10.1017/S1479244314000596"", ""10.1515/9783110365481"", ""10.1057/9780230596894"", ""10.4324/9780203408629_chapter_9"", ""10.7312/will93760"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199249084.001.0001"", ""10.1086/599554"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199695171.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc772hq"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511802072"", ""10.1080/0007131032000080203"", ""10.1111/1467-6494.696165"", ""10.1086/386134"", ""10.1093/ehr/ceu004"", ""10.4159/9780674984806"", ""10.1093/eic/III.3.239"", ""10.1007/s10767-006-9006-9"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198201731.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13619462.2014.962909"", ""10.7312/will93760"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300187854.001.0001"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbm071""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

In this paper we show how inductive datatypes may be added to the quantum programming language QPL. We construct a sound categorical model for the language and by doing so we provide the first detailed semantic treatment of user-defined inductive datatypes in quantum programming. We also show our denotational interpretation is invariant with respect to big-step reduction, thereby establishing another novel result for quantum programming. Compared to classical programming, this property is considerably more difficult to prove and we demonstrate its usefulness by showing how it immediately implies computational adequacy at all types. To further cement our results, our semantics is entirely based on a physically natural model of von Neumann algebras, which are mathematical structures used by physicists to study quantum mechanics.","[{""name"": ""Romain Péchoux"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simon Perdrix"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mathys Rennela"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vladimir Zamdzhiev"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/LICS.1996.561324"", ""10.1007/s00354-016-0204-3"", ""10.1145/3290345"", ""10.1017/S0960129506005378"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502"", ""10.1016/j.apal.2016.10.010"", ""10.1109/LICS.2017.8005095"", ""10.1142/S0129167X17500859"", ""10.1145/3341715"", ""10.1145/3209108.3209196"", ""10.4230/DagRep.8.9.112"", ""10.1145/2535838.2535879"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69166-2_18"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2018.03.027"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.266.11"", ""10.1017/S0960129504004256"", ""10.1137/S0036144598347011"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-10453-8"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.236.14"", ""10.1038/299802a0""]","['Computer Science', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7711), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7598)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Given an SMT formula $$\mathcal {I}$$ I as input, MachSMT leverages these learnt models to output a ranking of solvers based on predicted run time on the formula $$\mathcal {I}$$ I . We evaluate MachSMT on the solvers, benchmarks, and data obtained from SMT-COMP 2019 and 2020. We observe MachSMT frequently improves on competition winners, winning $$54$$ 54 divisions outright and up to a $$198.4$$ 198.4 % improvement in PAR-2 score, notably in logics that have broad applications (e.g., BV, LIA, NRA, etc.) in verification, program analysis, and software engineering. The MachSMT tool is designed to be easily tuned and extended to any suitable solver application by users. MachSMT is not a replacement for SMT solvers by any means. Instead, it is a tool that enables users to leverage the collective strength of the diverse set of algorithms implemented as part of these sophisticated solvers.","[{""name"": ""Joseph Scott"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aina Niemetz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mathias Preiner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Saeed Nejati"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vijay Ganesh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.220"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2004.12.002"", ""10.1017/S1471068414000179"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8602994"", ""10.3233/FAIA201017"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_14"", ""10.1007/11513988_4"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2017.8102235"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03421-4_11"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.SNAPL.2017.1"", ""10.1007/s10703-013-0203-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17462-0_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17462-0_5"", ""10.1145/1455518.1455522"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_49"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41540-6_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73368-3_52"", ""10.3233/978-1-60750-606-5-873"", ""10.1145/2093548.2093564"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-24690-6_28"", ""10.1136/bmj.i1981"", ""10.1137/090771806"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.240.2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-07046-9_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.1016/b978-1-55860-247-2.50037-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-50137-6_7"", ""10.1007/s10586-017-1117-8"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39634-2_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-40970-2_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11230-5"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58475-7_52"", ""10.3233/sat190101"", ""10.1007/s10009-009-0118-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-74970-7_41"", ""10.1016/S0065-2458(08)60520-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_19"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2009.187"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-20652-9_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08587-6_28"", ""10.1007/s10817-017-9407-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-19084-6_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-71070-7_37"", ""10.3233/AIC-150671"", ""10.14722/bar.2019.23080"", ""10.1016/0169-7439(87)80084-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-74970-7_50"", ""10.1613/jair.2490"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31612-8_18"", ""10.1109/TNN.2005.845141""]",['Computer Science'],"['Software', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

He considered that it encouraged early and improvident marriage with unfortunate consequences. There have been a number of attempts to determine whether Malthus was justified in supposing that the old poor law had this effect, some concluding that he was correct in his assumption, others that he was mistaken. The information contained in the first four English censuses did not include a breakdown of the population by age, sex, and marital status, and therefore did not provide a basis for a definitive test of Malthus's assertion before the repeal of the old poor law in 1834. The 1851 census, however, did provide this breakdown for five-year age groups which makes it possible to compare marriage patterns in counties in which a large proportion of the male workforce were ‘peasants’ (Malthus's term for agricultural labourers), and the Speenhamland provisions were widely adopted, with other counties. The results show that Malthus was mistaken.","[{""name"": ""E. A.

We use new data on local governments, or “Native Authorities,” to present the first quantitative comparison of African institutions under indirect rule in four colonies in 1948: Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Nyasaland, and Kenya. Tax data show that Native Authorities’ capacity varied within and between colonies, due to both underlying economic inequalities and African elites’ relations with the colonial government. Our findings suggest that Africans had a bigger hand in shaping British colonial institutions than often acknowledged.","[{""name"": ""Jutta Bolt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leigh Gardner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0021853702008320"", ""10.35188/UNU-WIDER/2015/974-9"", ""10.1017/S0043887111000104"", ""10.1017/S002205071500114X"", ""10.3982/ECTA9613"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-4474"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615597"", ""10.1257/jel.46.2.285"", ""10.1017/S0022050715000637"", ""10.1080/00220388.2010.500660"", ""10.1080/01440399808575237"", ""10.1017/S002185371400036X"", ""10.1080/13600818.2017.1416072"", ""10.1257/aer.101.5.2003"", ""10.2307/3866272"", ""10.1080/20780389.2017.1327807"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2013.01.003"", ""10.1093/envhis/10.2.314"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00540"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.11.009"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000128"", ""10.3886/E120581V1"", ""10.1017/S0212610915000348"", ""10.1017/S0022050712000630"", ""10.1093/ereh/hex010"", ""10.5089/9781455263431.001"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a098213"", ""10.1007/s101010100032"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316422335"", ""10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.02.046"", ""10.1017/S0022381609990569"", ""10.2307/1159747"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2003.12.001"", ""10.5089/9781451852943.001"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a097201"", ""10.2307/3772751"", ""10.1002/jid.1113"", ""10.1007/BF02686334"", ""10.1017/S0022050706000398"", ""10.1093/jae/ejq030"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2016.11.002"", ""10.1007/s10887-016-9130-y"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000312"", ""10.1257/089533002320951037"", ""10.1086/685410"", ""10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00195-7"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511800375"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a097197"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199661527.001.0001"", ""10.1111/gove.12129"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000049"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2010.10.002"", ""10.1111/jeea.12042"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674061293"", ""10.1111/ehr.12377"", ""10.1017/S0022050710000550"", ""10.1162/qjec.2008.123.1.139"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt029"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.04.014"", ""10.1111/ecoj.12347"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00023"", ""10.1086/499510"", ""10.1007/s10887-007-9017-z"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139013345"", ""10.1017/S0021853700008380"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.12041""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Demography', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

The micro-level analysis uses the family reconstitution method for ten rural Spanish localities. The husband's socio-economic level is regarded as an indicator of the family's socio-economic status. According to the available data, human agency between 1801 and 1909 resulted in a negative fertility response among all farm groups, with this negative response being especially strong among the landless and semi-landless.

The current standard for moving in VR is using a controller. Recently, VR Head Mounted Displays integrate new input modalities such as hand tracking which allows the investigation of different techniques to move in VR. This work explores different techniques for bare-handed locomotion since it could offer a promising alternative to existing freehand techniques. The presented techniques enable continuous movement through an immersive virtual environment. The proposed techniques are compared to each other in terms of efficiency, usability, perceived workload, and user preference.","[{""name"": ""Alexander Schäfer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gerd Reis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Didier Stricker"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/TVCG.2018.2887379"", ""10.1145/3282894.3282932"", ""10.1145/3206098.3206108"", ""10.1145/2983310.2985763"", ""10.1145/2967934.2968105"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-40477-1_23"", ""10.1109/TVCG.2019.2928304"", ""10.1080/10447318.2020.1785151"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-22888-4_29"", ""10.1145/2993369.2996327"", ""10.1016/j.cag.2019.09.005"", ""10.1145/3359996.3364722"", ""10.1145/2983298.2983307"", ""10.1145/2931002.2931018"", ""10.1109/VR51125.2022.00035"", ""10.1177/154193120605000909"", ""10.1016/S0166-4115(08)62386-9"", ""10.3724/SP.J.2096-5796.2018.0007"", ""10.1109/VR46266.2020.00047"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-85412-8_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-13544-6_6"", ""10.1145/3234253.3234291"", ""10.1109/VRW52623.2021.00080"", ""10.1109/MCG.2018.111125628"", ""10.1145/3180658"", ""10.1145/3543758.3543766"", ""10.1089/109493101300117884"", ""10.3390/electronics10060715"", ""10.1109/VRW55335.2022.00220"", ""10.1162/105474699566512"", ""10.1109/ICIS.2017.7960051"", ""10.1109/3DUI.2016.7460040"", ""10.1109/VR46266.2020.00060""]","['Computer Science', 'Neuroscience', 'Engineering']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

Using the example of the 1918 influenza pandemic, two factors that were central to the evolving pattern of global pandemic waves, connectivity and seasonality, are explored. Examples of the influences of these factors on pandemic waves in different locations are presented. Viewing the 1918 pandemic through the lens of compartmental models of infectious diseases, our analysis suggests that connectivity played a dominant role in the initial stages. With the passage of time and the progressive infection and consequent immunization of more and more people, however, the role of seasonality increased in importance, ultimately becoming the driving force behind the emergence of future waves of infection. Implications of these observations for pandemics caused by novel viruses such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Siddharth Chandra"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julia Christensen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shimon Likhtman"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Medicine', 'Mathematics']","['Epidemiology', 'Modeling and Simulation', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7618), ('1001 基础医学', 0.732)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"

It uses recently opened archives to reignite the debate over how far these years marked a radical break with past practices towards market-oriented approaches. The first part explains why inner cities became such a central issue for the Conservative party, running through all areas of domestic policy and taking up a vast amount of legislative time. The second part details some of the transatlantic neo-liberal ideas that blamed inner-city ills on government intervention, which were increasingly influential amongst senior Conservatives. The third section shows how little free market ideology actually succeeded in directing government policy, which more often than not saw an expansion of the role of the state. Antagonism with local authorities is revealed to have been a much more important and influential factor.

This article argues that the legal and political discourses of decentralization, autonomism, and federalism that circulated at the time of the imperial crisis between the Revolution of 1905 and the adoption of the Soviet Constitution in 1924 contributed to the formation of an ethno-national federation in place of the Russian Empire, despite both the efforts of the Bolsheviks to create a unitary state, and the expectations of a different future among contemporary observers. At the same time, the postimperial institutional framework became a product of political conjunctures rather than the legal discourse. Its weakness before the consolidating party dictatorship made the Soviet Union a showcase of sham federalism and autonomism.","[{""name"": ""IVAN SABLIN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""ALEXANDER SEMYONOV"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780195176155.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199769230.003.0012"", ""10.1515/9780804779265"", ""10.4324/9781315667713"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004175716.i-280"", ""10.3998/mpub.93113"", ""10.1353/imp.2016.0023"", ""10.1515/9781400831661""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Highlighting the value and importance of African archives in the construction of postcolonial African histories, I first reject what I call ‘postcolonial African archival pessimism’: the argument that postcolonial African archives are too disorganized or ill-kept to be of much, if any, value in configuring postcolonial African histories. Second, primarily through petition and complaint letters, I examine how Ghanaian workers protested racist and abusive workplace environments, government malfeasance, stagnating wages, and unfair dismissals in Kwame Nkrumah's Ghana. These archival gems illuminate how workers made claims to and performances of citizenship and reminded the state of their importance, politically and practically, to building the Ghanaian project. From Ghanaian and British archives, I seek to complement histories that highlight the centrality of African workers — through their letters and feet — in articulating the contradictions and aspirations of postcolonial African states.","[{""name"": ""Nana Osei-Opare"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0021853712000047"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511584091"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558863"", ""10.1017/S0021853700015073"", ""10.2307/138765"", ""10.2307/j.ctt2250vk9"", ""10.1017/hia.2015.7"", ""10.2307/j.ctv224tw6r"", ""10.1017/S0021853719000331"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511759604"", ""10.1080/03086534.2013.790226"", ""10.1017/S0020859014000339"", ""10.1017/S0020859017000189"", ""10.2307/25140091""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/jbr.2019.291,JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES,0603 World History,"""The People Who Write to Us Are the People Who Don't Like Us"": Class, Gender, and Citizenship in the Survey of Sickness, 1943-1952","AbstractThe Second World War and the rise of social medicine in 1940s Britain reframed population health as a social problem in need of state investigation. The resulting government inquiry, the Survey of Sickness, sampled the whole adult population of England and Wales, engaging a broad and diverse cross-section in public health research for the first time. Complaints made against the Survey of Sickness reveal a complex set of relationships between different sections of the public and the British state. This article situates complaints about privacy, liberty, and wasted resources, as well as challenges to the authority of survey fieldworkers, in the context of wider resistance to postwar controls. By viewing these protests and criticisms in light of the material circumstances of the people who made them, this article argues that, for those with social, economic, and political capital, the role of the public in public health was up for negotiation in postwar Britain. The everyday politics of the survey's doorstep encounters were heavily influenced by gendered notions of home and citizenship. This exploration of how different sections of the public were constructed by public health and how they responded to that construction describes the hierarchies of expertise under formation while illuminating how class and gender informed contemporary understandings of citizenship in the emerging postwar British state.","[{""name"": ""Daisy Payling"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199588459.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10408340308518291"", ""10.1017/S096077730000504X"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwq016"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199587650.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1t8928t"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199260300.001.0001"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwl009"", ""10.1086/386134"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719086076.001.0001"", ""10.2307/4049474"", ""10.1080/13688804.2012.721644"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(58)90828-6"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbt030"", ""10.1093/shm/1.1.39"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511557873.013"", ""10.1080/14490854.2016.1156211"", ""10.1080/03071022.2014.983680"", ""10.2307/2981213"", ""10.1525/california/9780520290341.001.0001"", ""10.2105/AJPH.92.5.722"", ""10.2752/147800413X13591373275411"", ""10.1086/590170"", ""10.4159/9780674038943"", ""10.1111/j.1468-4446.1999.00367.x"", ""10.1080/13619462.2016.1162157"", ""10.1136/jech.51.1.2"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3336.001.0001"", ""10.51952/9781447342281"", ""10.5040/9781474211161"", ""10.1080/713999468"", ""10.1179/174581808X279136"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6443.1996.tb00182.x"", ""10.1057/9781137284501_11"", ""10.1177/0022009405051556"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtn006"", ""10.1093/tcbh/5.2.129"", ""10.1017/S0018246X11000380"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719088049.003.0002"", ""10.1093/hwj/38.1.129"", ""10.1017/S0018246X00012462"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199267361.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09612020300200372"", ""10.1515/9781400843589"", ""10.1017/S0025727300066734"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(50)91828-9""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

10.1017/S0020859022000050,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Women's Rights and Global Socialism: Gendering Socialist Internationalism during the Cold War,"AbstractThis Special Issue explores the complicated relationship between women's rights and global socialism during the Cold War. This Introduction describes how the articles deal with this relationship in three, partly overlapping, periods. The first set of articles looks at how the ethos of the Popular Front resonated among women's movements in Asia, Latin America, and Europe, and examines the connections between interwar anti-fascist and anti-imperialist feminisms and those that re-emerged after World War II. The second set of articles focuses on the role and development of the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF) and its model of internationalism in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and China in the early Cold War. The final articles centre on the challenges faced by the WIDF from the 1960s, exploring issues such as the anti-apartheid struggles in South Africa, the Portuguese wars of decolonization, and the United Nations Decade for Women (1976–1985). Together with this process of decolonization, this Special Issue also examines how the consequences of postsocialism, in particular for women's rights (the loss of social rights, material security, and substantial challenges to reproductive freedoms), have triggered renewed debates about the history and legacies of communist women's liberation movements in the former socialist world.","[{""name"": ""Celia Donert"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780195327687.001.0001"", ""10.7312/trav17942""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Despite different starting points, all three countries pursued similar strategies in attempting to mobilize hydroelectricity for the war effort. The different access to and use of hydro in these states produced a vital economic and ultimately military advantage or disadvantage. The global dimensions of hydroelectric development during the war, moreover, demonstrate that this conflict was a turning point in the history of electrification.","[{""name"": ""Julie Cohn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthew Evenden"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marc Landry"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1524/9783486703672"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1prsrmh"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198202905.001.0001"", ""10.3138/9781442617117"", ""10.1111/hic3.12236"", ""10.59962/9780774826457-006"", ""10.56021/9780801828737"", ""10.1017/S0018246X00001680"", ""10.1109/EE.1948.6444051"", ""10.2307/jj.13944246"", ""10.1515/9789048521203"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-53423-1_6"", ""10.1017/S0960777318000115"", ""10.1109/T-AIEE.1942.5058451"", ""10.1515/9780773590977"", ""10.1080/02722010409481198"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511512131""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

However, recent research has shown that DNNs can be brittle to even slight variations of the input data. Therefore, rigorous testing of DNNs has gained widespread attention.While DNN robustness under norm-bound perturbation got significant attention over the past few years, our knowledge is still limited when natural variants of the input images come. These natural variants, e.g., a rotated or a rainy version of the original input, are especially concerning as they can occur naturally in the field without any active adversary and may lead to undesirable consequences. Thus, it is important to identify the inputs whose small variations may lead to erroneous DNN behaviors. The very few studies that looked at DNN’s robustness under natural variants, however, focus on estimating the overall robustness of DNNs across all the test data rather than localizing such error-producing points. This work aims to bridge this gap.To this end, we study the local per-input robustness properties of the DNNs and leverage those properties to build a white-box (DeepRobust-W) and a black-box (DeepRobust-B) tool to automatically identify the non-robust points. Our evaluation of these methods on three DNN models spanning three widely used image classification datasets shows that they are effective in flagging points of poor robustness. In particular, DeepRobust-W and DeepRobust-B are able to achieve an F1 score of up to 91.4% and 99.1%, respectively. We further show that DeepRobust-W can be applied to a regression problem in a domain beyond image classification. Our evaluation on three self-driving car models demonstrates that DeepRobust-W is effective in identifying points of poor robustness with F1 score up to 78.9%.","[{""name"": ""Ziyuan Zhong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yuchi Tian"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Baishakhi Ray"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/ICSE-SEIP.2019.00042"", ""10.1109/AITest.2019.000-6"", ""10.1145/3338906.3338954"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16722-6_10"", ""10.1145/3377811.3380415"", ""10.1145/3377811.3380391"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_15"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.90"", ""10.1145/3377811.3380339"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1"", ""10.1145/3338906.3338955"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2019.00108"", ""10.1145/3338906.3338930"", ""10.1145/3238147.3238202"", ""10.1145/3236024.3236082"", ""10.1214/aoms/1177730491"", ""10.1109/EuroSP.2016.36"", ""10.1145/3132747.3132785"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2019.00107"", ""10.22237/jmasm/1257035100"", ""10.21236/ADA482657"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_2"", ""10.1038/nature16961"", ""10.1038/163688a0"", ""10.1145/3377811.3380353"", ""10.1145/3377811.3380353"", ""10.1145/3238147.3238172"", ""10.1145/3377811.3380400"", ""10.1109/ICST46399.2020.00060"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.683"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2019.00126"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/543"", ""10.5244/C.30.87"", ""10.1109/ASE.2019.00043"", ""10.1145/3377811.3380422""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Surface collections and newly discovered inscriptional evidence indicate that this city is the early first-millennium royal seat of ‘Great King Hartapu’, long known from the enigmatic monuments of nearby Kizildağ and Karadağ. In addition to demonstrating this Iron Age city's existence, supported principally by (1) the site's size at the time and (2) the discovery of a royal inscription authored by Hartapu himself, TISP has documented the site's existence from the Late Chalcolithic period until the late first millennium BCE, with a maximum size reached between the Late Bronze and Iron Age periods, suggesting that the city was at its greatest extent and the regional political centre from at least the late second to the mid-first millennium BCE.","[{""name"": ""James F.

Although recognized as an ethnic minority in adjacent jurisdictions, the Irish state persistently and explicitly denied recognizing Travellers’ separate ethnicity and pursued assimilationist policies designed to eradicate Travellers’ differences. However, in the late 1980s and 1990s, the state recognized the structural disadvantage and social stigma to which Travellers are subjected, naming them as a protected group in equality legislation, as well as laws addressing incitement to hatred. Through these interventions, the state afforded Travellers rights on the basis of their collective identity as Travellers, while continuing to deny their ethnicity. After sustained campaigning, Traveller ethnicity was recognized by the prime minister of Ireland in 2017. This article explores the reasoning behind, and legal significance of, that statement of recognition in Ireland.1 We outline the evidence in support of ethnic recognition as a prelude to addressing the question of whether recognition is likely to afford the community any additional rights. We conclude that this is unlikely given the protections afforded to the group prior to ethnic recognition, though we argue that recognition may give the community a firmer basis for arguing for the activation of these preexisting rights.","[{""name"": ""Amanda Haynes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sindy Joyce"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jennifer Schweppe"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/0033-0124.00309"", ""10.1080/00750770709555892"", ""10.2307/20521689"", ""10.17645/si.v3i5.232"", ""10.2307/3316736"", ""10.1080/03323315.2012.676234"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2230.1983.tb02550.x"", ""10.26504/bkmnext342"", ""10.1080/02673039982768"", ""10.1080/1070289X.2014.944183"", ""10.1177/S0038038599000073"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511621789"", ""10.1017/S1474746407004034"", ""10.26504/rs56""]","['Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Anthropology', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Nevertheless, much of the scholarly approach to migrant identity, with the partial exception of a largely separate literature on citizenship, has eschewed overt ties to nationalism studies. When us-versus-them language is used in relation to nationalism, the focus or nodal point is the identity of the seemingly homogenous “us” of the nation. However, when migrants are othered, the focus is not always the nation, and while othering migrants always creates exclusion, it is not always exclusion from a nation or identity group. This state of the field article analyzes the literature on populism, securitization, biopolitics, and other critical scholarship related to the issue of othering migrants. In each of these bodies of work, different sets of “us” are set against migrants, some of which evoke identity and others of which do not, elucidating the links (or the lack thereof) of each approach to the study of nationalism. In each of these frameworks, the migrant Other comes up against a different frame of reference, leaving migrants themselves (or any sense of migrant identity) somewhat lost amid the analytical frameworks, at continual risk of being re-othered as victims of circumstance without agency.","[{""name"": ""Caress Schenk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/eis.2018.3"", ""10.1080/07393148.2012.729744"", ""10.1080/13629395.2016.1145828"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1496816"", ""10.1080/01436597.2012.720831"", ""10.1068/d3110"", ""10.1080/13688790.2013.850041"", ""10.1080/14650045.2018.1499380"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131752"", ""10.1215/08992363-3644385"", ""10.1111/anti.12148"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2017.1348224"", ""10.1177/0093650215577859"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1528094"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083"", ""10.1017/S0260210517000110"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11smmv5"", ""10.1111/tran.12115"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2142"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1528099"", ""10.1177/0038038517702599"", ""10.4337/9781786436030.00008"", ""10.1080/10402659.2017.1272303"", ""10.1093/ejil/chy065"", ""10.1080/13621025.2016.1182682"", ""10.1177/1354066116668662"", ""10.1177/0735275118794982"", ""10.1177/0967010620907198"", ""10.1080/13621025.2011.534911"", ""10.1515/9780804764025"", ""10.1177/0967010614530459"", ""10.1080/01419870.2019.1599133"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.13"", ""10.1080/01419870.2014.936892"", ""10.1177/0967010620916153"", ""10.1177/0896920516645934"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2015.1126085"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1528101"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491252"", ""10.1111/anti.12325"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-9694-6_3"", ""10.4135/9781446270073"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2015.08.003"", ""10.1002/psp.1929"", ""10.1080/21624887.2019.1644050"", ""10.1057/s41304-018-0160-0"", ""10.1177/0267323114545709"", ""10.13060/25706578.2019.20.1.464"", ""10.1177/0020715217690434"", ""10.1057/s41296-017-0142-y"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2019.1584525"", ""10.1080/08865655.2017.1414623"", ""10.1515/9781474433877-015"", ""10.1075/jlp.17028.krz"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1528100"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1528104"", ""10.1093/jrs/fen042"", ""10.1080/13688790.2013.850043"", ""10.1075/jlp.17042.krz"", ""10.1086/657496"", ""10.1177/0308275X18775199"", ""10.1017/nps.2019.91"", ""10.1111/imre.12146"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226738901.001.0001"", ""10.1353/con.2017.0021"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogz057"", ""10.1177/0197918319879926"", ""10.1080/13600826.2016.1173018"", ""10.1080/0966369X.2018.1441141"", ""10.1057/s41304-017-0137-4"", ""10.1177/0306396818793582"", ""10.1111/j.1943-0787.2009.01145.x"", ""10.1177/2331502418821855"", ""10.1080/14767430.2017.1280283"", ""10.4324/9780203876794"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1550158"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2019.1691914"", ""10.4337/9781786436030.00030"", ""10.1111/j.1747-7379.2004.tb00223.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-081309-145847"", ""10.1080/1070289X.2014.950974"", ""10.1177/1440783318791761"", ""10.1093/migration/mnu023"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2019.1671181"", ""10.1177/0967010619830590"", ""10.1177/0011392117717294"", ""10.1177/0967010619862921"", ""10.1080/13621025.2014.886441"", ""10.1111/imig.12588"", ""10.1002/psp.635""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

It examines the institutional responses to the invasion on the part of the Indian Legislative Assembly, and a series of demonstrations, local meetings and boycotts whose implications reverberated in the local and international press as well as in the concerns of British colonial authorities.

Using newly rediscovered Inland Revenue income distribution estimates, we show that Britain had an unusually high concentration of personal incomes in 1911 compared to other industrial nations. We also find that Britain’s substantial inequality reduction over the next four decades was largely driven by a collapse in top capital incomes. This parallels findings for France, the United States, and other western countries, that reduced inequality was mainly caused by declining top unearned incomes, owing to economic shocks, policy responses, and non-market mechanisms associated with the retreat from globalization.","[{""name"": ""Peter Scott"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James T.

The analytical problem of identifying how private firms use legal regimes to take control of land—whether for mining, plantations, or Special Economic Zones—now animates a new body of research seeking the historical antecedents for contemporary land grabs. In the case of colonial South Asia, existing scholarship has often tended to suggest that the law precedes processes of capital accumulation, and that colonial capital operated within the confines of definable, even if legally plural, institutional regimes, such as property rights and commercial law. This perspective suggests, if only implicitly, that capitalist firms prefer to work within formal frameworks of legality. In this article, I outline a different understanding of the place of law in colonial South Asia, which follows the formation of property law for coal at the end of the nineteenth century. I argue that the discursive framing of coal's status as property emerged out of, rather than preceded, social and ecological displacements caused by a coal commodity boom after 1894. Reconstructing conflicts over coal-bearing agrarian land through civil court records and mining company property deeds, I demonstrate how the absence of coal property within the colonial legal archive was reassembled through a recursive conception of legality. This genealogy of law recovers the historical context for contemporary struggles over mining claims in India's coal region today.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Shutzer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-9655.2004.00211.x"", ""10.1017/S0010417518000087"", ""10.2307/j.ctvt1sj8f"", ""10.1177/096466399400300202"", ""10.1093/ahr/121.5.1567""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Building and Construction', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'General Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7446), ('0909 草学', 0.741)]]"
10.1017/ssh.2020.10,SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY,0603 World History,Sample-Selection Biases and the Historical Growth Pattern of Children,"ABSTRACTBodenhorn et al. (2017) have sparked considerable controversy by arguing that the fall in adult stature observed in military samples in the United States and Britain during industrialization was a figment of selection on unobservables in the samples. While subsequent papers have questioned the extent of the bias (Komlos and A’Hearn 2019; Zimran 2019), there is renewed concern about selection bias in historical anthropometric datasets. Therefore, this article extends Bodenhorn et al.’s discussion of selection bias on unobservables to sources of children’s growth, specifically focusing on biases that could distort the age pattern of growth. Understanding how the growth pattern of children has changed is important because these changes underpinned the secular increase in adult stature and are related to child stunting observed in developing countries today. However, there are significant sources of unobserved selection in historical datasets containing children’s and adolescents’ height and weight. This article highlights, among others, three common sources of bias: (1) positive selection of children into secondary school in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; (2) distorted height by age profiles created by age thresholds for enlistment in the military; and (3) changing institutional ecology that determines to which institutions children are sent. Accounting for these biases adjusts the literature in two ways: evidence of a strong pubertal growth spurt in the nineteenth century is weaker than formerly acknowledged and some long-run analyses of changes in children’s growth are too biased to be informative, especially for Japan.","[{""name"": ""Eric B.

It outlines the rise of debates on the idea of the governability of the global biosphere in late Soviet Russia (1970s–1980s), focusing particularly on the extension of Vladimir Vernadskii's famous theory of the biosphere and its governance (the stage of the noosphere) into computer modeling and systems analysis. As a result, a new notion of governance as guidance through milieu arose to conceptualize global governance of the biosphere. This conceptual innovation was part of Soviet scientists’ attempt to liberalize the centrally commanded Soviet governmental system.","[{""name"": ""EGLĖ RINDZEVIČIŪTĖ"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/02604027.1993.9972327"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107110069.016"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816693122.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3137.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2015.05.008"", ""10.1177/0263276410361499"", ""10.1353/book.40889"", ""10.1525/hsns.2016.46.5.633"", ""10.5612/slavicreview.75.1.52"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316534762"", ""10.1111/0033-0124.00337"", ""10.4324/9780203332320"", ""10.1111/j.1558-5646.1964.tb01674.x"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262035316.001.0001"", ""10.1086/667828"", ""10.1525/9780520928114"", ""10.1525/hsns.2016.46.5.592"", ""10.4324/9781315773810"", ""10.1080/14682745.2012.759560"", ""10.5751/ES-03180-140232"", ""10.1016/j.shpsa.2017.03.011"", ""10.4324/9780203815793"", ""10.1177/0967010611399616"", ""10.1126/science.1259855"", ""10.1162/152638101300138521"", ""10.2307/j.ctt5vm5bn"", ""10.1038/415023a"", ""10.1017/S0007087412000015"", ""10.5840/enviroethics19881023"", ""10.7591/cornell/9781501703188.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139021043"", ""10.1086/448747"", ""10.2307/1354445"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3336.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8417.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1053837215000772"", ""10.1515/9780822373605"", ""10.1215/9780822386421"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9800.001.0001"", ""10.2753/SOR1061-015433017"", ""10.1002/wcc.412"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262012720.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-1972-9"", ""10.1177/0306312709341598"", ""10.1080/714000556"", ""10.5699/slaveasteurorev2.93.1.0181"", ""10.1016/0959-3780(91)90017-N"", ""10.4324/9781315628059-2""]","['Social Sciences', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Astronomy and Astrophysics', 'Atmospheric Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7193), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7071)], [('0706 大气科学', 0.7502), ('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7343)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Tests that can nondeterministically pass or fail when run on the same code version are called flaky tests. These tests are a major problem because they can mislead developers to debug their recent code changes when the failures are unrelated to these changes. One prominent category of flaky tests is order-dependent (OD) tests, which can deterministically pass or fail depending on the order in which the set of tests are run. By detecting OD tests in advance, developers can fix these tests before they change their code. Due to the high cost required to explore all possible orders (n! permutations for n tests), prior work has developed tools that randomize orders to detect OD tests. Experiments have shown that randomization can detect many OD tests, and that most OD tests depend on just one other test to fail. However, there was no analysis of the probability that randomized orders detect OD tests. In this paper, we present the first such analysis and also present a simple change for sampling random test orders to increase the probability. We finally present a novel algorithm to systematically explore all consecutive pairs of tests, guaranteeing to detect all OD tests that depend on one other test, while running substantially fewer orders and tests than simply running all test pairs.","[{""name"": ""Anjiang Wei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pu Yi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tao Xie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Darko Marinov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wing Lam"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/2786805.2786823"", ""10.1109/ICST.2018.00011"", ""10.1145/2771783.2771793"", ""10.1109/SCAM.2018.00009"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2015.66"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2015.133"", ""10.1145/2635868.2635917"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2017.71"", ""10.1145/3377813.3381370"", ""10.1145/3293882.3330570"", ""10.1145/3377811.3381749"", ""10.1109/ICST.2019.00038"", ""10.1145/3395363.3397364"", ""10.1109/ISSRE5003.2020.00045"", ""10.1145/3428270"", ""10.1145/2635868.2635920"", ""10.1109/ICSE-SEIP.2017.16"", ""10.1145/2025113.2025202"", ""10.1145/1883612.1883618"", ""10.37236/30"", ""10.1145/3338906.3338925"", ""10.1016/0095-8956(80)90044-1"", ""10.1002/stv.430"", ""10.1109/32.988498"", ""10.1145/2610384.2610404"", ""10.1109/ICSE-SEIP.2017.13""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

Our implementation shows promise: It finds invariants for (in)finite-state programs, can beat state-of-the-art probabilistic model checkers, and is competitive with modern tools dedicated to invariant synthesis and expected runtime reasoning.","[{""name"": ""Kevin Batz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mingshuai Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Junges"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benjamin Lucien Kaminski"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joost-Pieter Katoen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christoph Matheja"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_1"", ""10.1145/3158122"", ""10.1007/3-540-46419-0_27"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72016-2_11"", ""10.1007/3-540-63165-8_199"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-13185-1_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31784-3_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_25"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7507921"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_27"", ""10.1145/3434320"", ""10.1007/s00165-021-00547-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_15"", ""10.1609/aaai.v30i1.10416"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_1"", ""10.1145/3093333.3009873"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-13185-1_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_44"", ""10.1007/s00236-017-0297-2"", ""10.1007/3-540-44804-7_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_26"", ""10.1145/2775051.2677001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-11245-5_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_4"", ""10.1145/3371105"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_26"", ""10.1007/3-540-58085-9_75"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00633-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_27"", ""10.1145/3428208"", ""10.1007/s00236-018-0321-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49498-1_15"", ""10.1145/3208102"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15769-1_24"", ""10.1145/1059816.1059824"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72019-3_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1145/3296979.3192394"", ""10.1002/9780470316887"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_37"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10696-0_30"", ""10.1145/3450967"", ""10.2140/pjm.1955.5.285""]",['Computer Science'],"['Hardware and Architecture', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

This article explores for the first time the day-to-day experience of the power and authority of workhouse masters, matrons, other officers of the workhouse, and its Board of Guardians, and the resistance and agency of resentful inmates. Despite new sets of regulations to guide workhouse officers in the uniform imposition of discipline on residents, there was a high degree of regional diversity not only in the types of offenses committed by paupers but also in welfare policy relating to the punishments inflicted for disorderly and refractory behavior. And while pauper agency was significant, it should not be overstated, given the disparity in power between inmates and workhouse officials.","[{""name"": ""Samantha Williams"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CHOL9780521257909.006"", ""10.1515/9781400843589"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495823"", ""10.1515/9781846151507"", ""10.35488/lps99.2017.66"", ""10.1017/S0956793308002574"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496059"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-08420-0"", ""10.1080/1031461X.2016.1208258"", ""10.1353/jsh.2005.0129"", ""10.1007/s10761-013-0249-7"", ""10.1080/03071020600562934"", ""10.1017/S0020859009000698""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Its main argument is that this group of thinkers and militants made decisive contributions, between the 1950s and 1970s, to the formulation and dissemination of the diagnosis of a global fisheries crisis threatening the planet's stocks. These warnings about a global fishing crisis paved the way for present-day concerns about a planetary decline of marine life. By assessing the role played by the neo-Malthusians, this article analyses the history of the post-Second World War debates on ocean productivity, ‘unconventional’ fisheries, and fisheries exhaustion, showing how they were marked by highly optimistic expectations regarding the exploitation of the ‘ocean frontier’. For the neo-Malthusians, it was crucial to discredit this cornucopian vision of the ocean as a horn of plenty, itself a result of contemporaneous euphoria in the world of industrial fishing. In conclusion, this article sheds new light on the history of debates about (over)population and world resources, and on the rise of an ‘environmentalism of the oceans’ in the second half of the twentieth century.","[{""name"": ""FABIEN LOCHER"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4159/9780674029835"", ""10.2307/213431"", ""10.1086/661272"", ""10.4159/9780674970731"", ""10.1017/S0010417507000448"", ""10.1177/2053019614564785"", ""10.1177/0306312701031002005"", ""10.2307/3984231"", ""10.1093/ahr/117.5.1411"", ""10.2307/j.ctt5hjdm1"", ""10.1016/0165-7836(95)00436-X"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226249681.001.0001"", ""10.1007/BF02582476"", ""10.4324/9781315717920-3"", ""10.1353/jwh.0.0017"", ""10.7312/columbia/9780231147668.003.0013"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511730382.012"", ""10.36019/9780813544236"", ""10.1093/envhis/ems020"", ""10.1177/0306312703335001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139939485"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674065062"", ""10.1177/0306312709341598"", ""10.4324/9781315628059"", ""10.1126/science.162.3859.1243"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7709.2008.00713.x"", ""10.1086/257497"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674067219"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511583681"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0015143"", ""10.3917/rhmc.601.0007"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139047470"", ""10.5950/0738-1360-26.1.75"", ""10.1163/9789004479081"", ""10.56021/9780801864919"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1789.003.0013"", ""10.5962/bhl.title.39273"", ""10.1126/science.166.3901.72""]","['Environmental Science', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

GIS mapping of the Ottoman censuses of Jerusalem illuminates these urban patterns and reveals the importance of scale when considering this question. Even the most “integrated” neighborhood on the aggregate level reveals “segregated” zones of clustering and concentration at the smaller scales of quadrant, street, and building. At the same time, the proximity and exposure of residents to each other reveals how very porous boundaries were in the neighborhood. In order to understand how and why the city developed such a complex spatial pattern, qualitative sources like newspapers, memoirs, and court records are a necessary supplement to demographic records. This approach allows for a comprehensive outlining of the economic, legal, religious, and cultural factors and forces contributing to both segregation and integration in an Ottoman city. It also points to a multidisciplinary reconstruction of the social space of an historic neighborhood.","[{""name"": ""Michelle U.

Although Friedman’s 1975 visit has been widely discussed, his 1981 visit has been largely neglected. However, this visit was particularly important as it preceded a severe currency and banking crisis, stemming from an overvalued fixed exchange rate. The crisis put at risk the influence of the “Chicago Boys” and the political and economic liberalization process. We analyze Friedman’s views regarding Chile’s pegged exchange rate strategy followed between 1979 and 1982, and his position on economic and political freedom.","[{""name"": ""Sebastian Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leonidas Montes"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139004077"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-38784-4"", ""10.17016/FEDS.2018.013"", ""10.1177/056943451005500112"", ""10.1215/00182702-7202548"", ""10.4159/9780674054264-010"", ""10.1080/05775132.1977.11470300"", ""10.1093/cje/bex052"", ""10.1017/S0010417519000239"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.1983.tb00033.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-10743-7_4"", ""10.1007/s11138-014-0290-8"", ""10.4337/roke.2018.04.06"", ""10.1080/01436597.2016.1268906"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-53255-4_2"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226184807.001.0001"", ""10.1080/1042771032000083318"", ""10.1177/0022009416685895"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8417.001.0001""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)]]"

These logics build on so-called separation algebras, which allow expressing properties of heap regions such that modifications to a region do not invalidate properties stated about the remainder of the heap. This concept is key to enabling modular reasoning and also extends to concurrency. While heaps are naturally related to mathematical graphs, many ubiquitous graph properties are non-local in character, such as reachability between nodes, path lengths, acyclicity and other structural invariants, as well as data invariants which combine with these notions. Reasoning modularly about such graph properties remains notoriously difficult, since a local modification can have side-effects on a global property that cannot be easily confined to a small region.In this paper, we address the question: What separation algebra can be used to avoid proof arguments reverting back to tedious global reasoning in such cases? To this end, we consider a general class of global graph properties expressed as fixpoints of algebraic equations over graphs. We present mathematical foundations for reasoning about this class of properties, imposing minimal requirements on the underlying theory that allow us to define a suitable separation algebra. Building on this theory, we develop a general proof technique for modular reasoning about global graph properties expressed over program heaps, in a way which can be directly integrated with existing separation logics. To demonstrate our approach, we present local proofs for two challenging examples: a priority inheritance protocol and the non-blocking concurrent Harris list.","[{""name"": ""Siddharth Krishna"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexander J.

During fieldwork carried out with Quechua-speaking farmers in Ayopaya between 2011 and 2012, I learned about people's enduring concerns with a recent hacienda past. Against governmental declarations that Bolivia's colonial past was dead or had passed, farmers meditated on the duration of earlier histories of colonial land dispossession and violations of indigenous sovereignty. Talk about the region's oppressive history here allowed people to assess deficient state aid and resources but also to oppose unwelcome state interventions pushing a legal model of bounded collectivity. I trace the ways that farmers and villagers mobilized the hacienda past to address inequitable land tenure, violated sovereignty, and women's marginalization from political life, and thereby raise new questions about the critical possibilities opened up by the re-politicization of this colonial history. Rural support for Bolivia's Movement Toward Socialism party government eroded nearly a decade ago, and this complicates both triumphalist and defeatist accounts of President Evo Morales’ 2019 resignation, which tend to paint Morales’ rural indigenous supporters as innocent and naïve.","[{""name"": ""Mareike Winchell"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9780691188058"", ""10.1057/9780230277946"", ""10.1017/S0023879100019531"", ""10.2307/3178066"", ""10.1215/9780822376781"", ""10.4236/ajps.2013.41009"", ""10.1215/9780822376903"", ""10.7560/713390"", ""10.14318/hau6.1.014"", ""10.1080/1369801X.2011.545575"", ""10.1177/0308275X14543393"", ""10.1215/00182168-3824065"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-5754-0_5"", ""10.1177/1463499618779735"", ""10.1515/9780804769884"", ""10.1111/j.1935-4940.2012.01249.x"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2012.03.002"", ""10.1215/9780822386230"", ""10.14506/ca31.1.04"", ""10.3798/tia.1937-0237.14028"", ""10.1080/13569329309361799"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-102313-030159"", ""10.14506/ca32.1.09"", ""10.1017/S0022216X06002069"", ""10.1215/9780822376361"", ""10.1080/10714839.2004.11724509"", ""10.1215/22011919-3615934"", ""10.2307/1341787"", ""10.4324/9780203450994_chapter_5"", ""10.1215/9780822379850"", ""10.5195/BSJ.2015.145"", ""10.1215/9780822391500"", ""10.1525/luminos.31"", ""10.1215/9781478007234"", ""10.1215/00382876-1472612"", ""10.1215/9780822386179"", ""10.1215/9780822377023"", ""10.1177/1463499616636269"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1360.2008.00007.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11cw07s"", ""10.1086/701117"", ""10.1111/amet.12558"", ""10.1080/17442222.2015.1034442"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2014.00239.x"", ""10.1080/03066150.2016.1229309"", ""10.2307/jj.11786289"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226175607.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Drawing upon prefectural distributions of the Jesuits and Chinese scientific works, this paper demonstrates that the Jesuits stimulated Confucian literati to study science. On average, the literati’s scientific works increased four times in prefectures with Jesuit scientists after 1580. But this effect shrank after the Jesuits were expelled by the emperor of China in 1723. Since China’s scholar-official system remained unchanged, the literati’s scientific research aimed to serve the needs of statecraft rather than translating into economic progress.","[{""name"": ""Chicheng Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139644594.021"", ""10.1093/qje/qjv004"", ""10.1093/qje/qjy024"", ""10.1111/jeea.12113"", ""10.1515/9781503618398"", ""10.1162/003355304772839588"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.07.009"", ""10.4159/9780674036475"", ""10.1007/s004070000033"", ""10.1093/qje/qju007"", ""10.1093/qje/qjs015"", ""10.1162/qjec.2009.124.2.531"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226735856.001.0001"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3449578"", ""10.1093/qje/qjx046"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2019.102382"", ""10.2307/2942281"", ""10.1257/aer.104.10.3222"", ""10.3886/E132821V1"", ""10.1257/aer.104.1.84"", ""10.1515/9781400882915"", ""10.1086/710534"", ""10.1093/qje/qjv025"", ""10.1257/aer.20170619"", ""10.3982/ECTA13448"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.12.010"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2016.11.003"", ""10.1086/452150"", ""10.1093/qje/qjr035"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3628953"", ""10.1086/655976"", ""10.1111/ecoj.12551"", ""10.1257/jep.20.2.3"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00458"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00565"", ""10.1525/9780520921474"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25417-9_3"", ""10.4159/9780674028814""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Demography', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0738248019000440,LAW AND HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0301 Law,In This Issue,"The early-Tudor English government oversaw the rise of various centralised courts offering the king's subjects access to extraordinary justice in their private suits. One such new arena was the ‘Court of Requests’, an early equity or conscience court long overshadowed in histories of the period by the better-known courts of Star Chamber and Chancery. This article analyses the little-studied Requests archives to ask who sued there and when/why the court became associated with specifically poor men's causes. Focusing on the formative decade of ‘popularisation’ between 1515 and 1525, it finds that whilst litigants appear to have been largely from the lower sectors of society compared to their counterparts in the other conciliar courts, most petitioners opted for imprecise, rhetorical and non-static descriptions of their relative poverty – defined not just economically, but also in terms of age, property, and kin – in comparison to their opponents, appealing to the specific interpretation of conscience in Requests. The article thus scrutinises the methodologies we use for uncovering the demography of early-modern central courts, and has implications for understanding litigants' legal strategies, recorded identification as distinct from self-identification, and the theory and practice behind commonly-held ideals about the provision of royal justice for the ‘poor’.","[{""name"": ""Laura Flannigan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv136c3vh.16"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511560385"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199600793.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511660207"", ""10.1080/00379817509514045"", ""10.1093/ehr/XCI.CCCLX.481"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511583124"", ""10.2307/743785"", ""10.1525/9780520345614"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511560262"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674184169"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511896408""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

These rebellions occurred for many different reasons, reflecting the diversity of context and history across colonial societies in Africa and Asia. Religion naturally played a strong role in most of the anti-colonial rebellions during the First World War, most prominently Islam. This article looks at the role Islam played in two key anti-colonial rebellions in North and West Africa: the rebellions in Batna, Algeria, and the Kaocen War in Niger, respectively. The article examines how Islam was instrumentalized by rebels, imperial collaborators, and French officers and administrators to further their own ends. Rebels called upon Islam to help inspire anti-colonial movements, to bind together diverse populations, and to contextualize their actions in wider socio-political conflicts. Imperial collaborators likewise called on religious authority to assist with European imperial recruitment efforts. French officers and administrators used Islam both as a justification and a target for collective punishment and repression after the rebellions were put down from 1917. This repression is still under-studied in a period usually portrayed as evidencing broad imperial harmony, rather than violent extraction and oppression.","[{""name"": ""JONATHAN KRAUSE"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctt16gz74b"", ""10.2307/120244"", ""10.56021/9780801888243"", ""10.14375/NP.9782951953970"", ""10.1525/9780520920378"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511523854"", ""10.4159/9780674977402"", ""10.1017/S0021853714000711"", ""10.1017/S0021853713000819"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511575457"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195176155.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv224tvv3"", ""10.1163/18725457-12341237"", ""10.3917/bouch.ager.2005.03"", ""10.4324/9780203327623"", ""10.1080/00358533.2014.898506"", ""10.1177/0968344510393596"", ""10.1093/0195063864.001.0001"", ""10.1108/S0198-871920170000033006"", ""10.1017/9781139029230"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198844044.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00003590""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Religious studies', 'History', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X20000230,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,INTIMACY IN MODERN BRITISH HISTORY,"AbstractRecent developments in the history of modern Britain have led to the emergence of a history of intimacy, whether or not it is recognized as such. This historiographical review argues that intimacy is a useful category of historical analysis. Thinking in terms of inter-relationships between different forms of intimacy allows us to think with greater conceptual clarity about these forms, as well as types of intimacy that are difficult to categorize. The first section reviews recent and significant contributions to the literature and seeks to draw out existing connections and crosscurrents between subfields. The second section turns to recent work on the histories of selfhood and the emotions and considers what thinking about intimacy might add to these fields; it then builds on this recent work to propose that one way to ‘do’ the history of intimacy is to think in terms of ‘intimate practices’.","[{""name"": ""GEORGE MORRIS"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780203070185"", ""10.1086/665387"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbi046"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-34117-4"", ""10.2307/1858841"", ""10.1017/9781108652834"", ""10.1525/9780520946194"", ""10.1080/13642529.2010.515806"", ""10.1086/665270"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226001753.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781139644310"", ""10.1086/432743"", ""10.1177/0952695116653305"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719084553.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822387992"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199677207.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226788272.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199677481.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400830855"", ""10.1086/204622"", ""10.1080/13555502.2015.1057390"", ""10.1515/9781400843589"", ""10.1215/10642684-2007-026"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199574667.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199572946.001.0001"", ""10.1093/shm/hkq008"", ""10.1093/ahr/120.2.543"", ""10.5406/illinois/9780252034930.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-34084-5"", ""10.5040/9781350045453"", ""10.1086/664956"", ""10.1093/ahr/rhy202"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2013.795491"", ""10.1080/09612025.2015.1123025"", ""10.1215/9780822381860"", ""10.1086/448612"", ""10.1080/03071022.2018.1472885"", ""10.1515/9780748691142"", ""10.1093/ahr/123.1.60"", ""10.1086/448875"", ""10.1057/9781137316073"", ""10.2307/j.ctt9qh0wr"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107295575"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511778353"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511512001"", ""10.1057/9781137470997"", ""10.1093/ahr/120.2.530"", ""10.1017/9781139381611"", ""10.2752/147800414X13893661072717"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbi006"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316027059"", ""10.1086/665396"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwy055"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226133294.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496097"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199252183.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781139923880"", ""10.1525/9780520957787"", ""10.1080/13619462.2018.1539828"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199267361.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350095946"", ""10.1093/jsh/shy118"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198725039.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13619462.2016.1226808"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226706283.001.0001"", ""10.1086/493203"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198823070.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199546480.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2303.2012.00621.x"", ""10.1080/13642529.2018.1511105""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Rereading ʿAflaq's most important texts is part of a broader reconsideration of the intellectual history of modern Syria between nationalism and liberalism, revolution and reaction. While recognizing the traces of nineteenth-century German idealist philosophy and Romantic nationalism in ʿAflaq's thought, this piece complicates the conventional understanding of his work by showing a striking resemblance with the left-personalism of Emmanuel Mounier and theEspritgroup. This unexplored connection constitutes a “missing link” in the intellectual genealogy of Baʿthism. As such, this article contributes to a more expansive and complicated global history of personalism. At the same time, this reconsideration of Michel ʿAflaq suggests a more compelling account of the making of modern Syria, a history with roots more tangled than historians have hitherto imagined.","[{""name"": ""MAX WEISS"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5040/9780755610082"", ""10.1017/S0020743811000079"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921667.007"", ""10.1163/9789047402695_036"", ""10.1017/S0020743800061158"", ""10.4324/9780203888568"", ""10.1515/9780804792608"", ""10.7560/757455"", ""10.1017/S0020743800030014"", ""10.1515/9781400858392"", ""10.1017/9781316479827"", ""10.1215/1089201x-2008-020"", ""10.1111/j.1478-1913.1959.tb02360.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226499888.001.0001"", ""10.3917/ving.102.0031"", ""10.1515/9780804774246"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226773858.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2708959"", ""10.2307/3012280"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511563522"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195114393.001.0001"", ""10.14321/frencolohist.17.1.0103"", ""10.5250/quiparle.17.1.125"", ""10.1111/j.1478-1913.1977.tb03332.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

We analyze why companies listed on these markets and how this changed over time. We find that the provincial exchanges had traditionally been complementary to London, providing a trading venue for smaller regional companies. However, they gradually lost their uniqueness and were increasingly competing with London by listing similar stocks. Much of this change can be explained by shifts in industrial composition, leading to more companies being headquartered and listed in the capital and many of the remaining regional firms cross-listing in London to achieve certification.","[{""name"": ""Meeghan Rogers"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gareth Campbell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""John Turner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/rfs/hhm030"", ""10.1179/ldn.1997.22.1.63"", ""10.1111/0022-1082.00137"", ""10.1111/0022-1082.00181"", ""10.1162/qjec.2008.123.4.1679"", ""10.1017/S0022109009090097"", ""10.1017/S0007680512000025"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01468.x"", ""10.1007/s10679-006-8278-2"", ""10.1111/ehr.12075"", ""10.1093/es/khr072"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2013.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2005.10.010"", ""10.1093/ereh/hew010"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00214"", ""10.1017/S0968565013000024"", ""10.1017/S0007680500001239"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00524.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00453.x"", ""10.1017/S1467222700006182"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhz020"", ""10.1111/ehr.12530"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2009.02346.x"", ""10.1080/00076791.2012.741969"", ""10.1017/S0022050714000874"", ""10.1080/00076790701295821"", ""10.1111/ehr.12620"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00632.x"", ""10.1093/0199242550.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00343409850119067"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00477.x""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Accounting', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Little has been written about either the role of consuls as middlemen or of Spanish participation in the traffic in treaty ports. Yet, several sources indicate that many officials at Spanish consulates in coastal China were intensely involved in the shipment of Chinese emigrants to Cuba and other coolie trade destinations, and were also at the centre of international scandals. These consular officers frequently used their authority to obtain a monopoly over the trade. In this article, I argue that the coolie trade was the main objective of Spain's consular deployment in China, and that the involvement of these consular officials was crucial in developing an abusive migratory system and sustaining the mistreatment of Chinese immigrant workers throughout the second half of the nineteenth century.","[{""name"": ""Mònica Ginés-Blasi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9781315655079"", ""10.1080/07075332.2015.1100130"", ""10.1080/13260219.2010.487511"", ""10.4324/9780203100387"", ""10.4324/9781315636856-9"", ""10.1215/9780822393573-004"", ""10.1163/9789004339637"", ""10.1387/hc.17724"", ""10.1017/S0026749X17000154"", ""10.3368/lbr.52.1.61"", ""10.1017/S0147547916000399"", ""10.1017/S0020859012000430"", ""10.1017/tam.2018.43"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtv018"", ""10.1177/009770047900500402"", ""10.3406/carav.1971.1787""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

It argues that the CCP's expanding cultural influence can be attributed to the Party's commercial acumen. Operating within a permissive colonial regulatory regime, the CCP expanded its control of local and regional markets for left-wing printed materials. The content of CCP literature was inevitably propagandistic – that is, shaped by the changing demands of the Chinese government's foreign policy and by a need to attract foreign remittances and accommodate socialist transformation at home. Hong Kong's emergence as a pivot in propaganda wars that were global in scope created tensions between the United States and Britain, and led governments in Southeast Asia to strengthen state controls on imported communist media. As such, this article makes an original contribution to Hong Kong colonial history and deepens our understanding of transnational dynamics within Southeast Asia.","[{""name"": ""Florence Mok"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/0308653042000329012"", ""10.1080/03086539708583002"", ""10.1093/pastj/gts032"", ""10.1017/S0305741008000076"", ""10.1177/0920203X8700200102"", ""10.2307/3035095"", ""10.1177/000271625127700121"", ""10.2307/3024635"", ""10.1080/07075332.2020.1762239"", ""10.2307/27516601"", ""10.1017/S0021911819000561"", ""10.1017/S0305741000042818""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Such growth in income per head as did occur was highly episodic, concentrated in a few decades and then followed by long periods of stagnation of income per head. Moreover, at no time before 1800 did the leading economies of northwestern Europe reach levels of income per capita much different from peak levels achieved hundreds of years earlier in the most developed regions of Italy and China. When the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, it was not preceded by patterns of pre-modern income growth that were in any way remarkable, neither by sustained prior growth in real incomes nor exceptional levels of income per head. The Great Divergence, seen as the onset of sustained increases in income per head despite strong population growth, and achievement of incomes beyond pre-modern peaks, was a late occurrence, arising only from 1800.","[{""name"": ""Jack A.

The technique relies on constructing two slightly different versions of the same program. It infers difference relations between the corresponding variables at key control points of the joint control-flow graph of the two program versions. The desired post-condition is then proved by inducting on the program parameter N, wherein the difference invariants are crucially used in the inductive step. This contrasts with classical techniques that rely on finding potentially complex loop invaraints for each loop in the program. Our synergistic combination of inductive reasoning and finding simple difference invariants helps prove properties of programs that cannot be proved even by the winner of Arrays sub-category in SV-COMP 2021. We have implemented a prototype tool called Diffy to demonstrate these ideas.

However, these graphs’ size is often entirely out of reach for algorithms using explicit state-space exploration, necessitating alternative approaches such as the symbolic one.Symbolic methods for BSCC detection often show impressive performance, but can sometimes take a long time to converge in large graphs. In this paper, we provide a symbolic state-space reduction method for labelled transition systems, calledinterleaved transition guided reduction(ITGR), which aims to alleviate current problems of BSCC detection by efficiently identifying large portions of the non-BSCC states.We evaluate the suggested heuristic on an extensive collection of 125 real-world biologically motivated systems. We show that ITGR can easily handle all these models while being either the only method to finish, or providing at least an order-of-magnitude speedup over existing state-of-the-art methods. We then use a set of synthetic benchmarks to demonstrate that the technique also consistently scales to graphs with more than$$2^{1000}$$21000vertices, which was not possible using previous methods.","[{""name"": ""Nikola Beneš"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luboš Brim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Samuel Pastva"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Šafránek"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/QEST.2010.13"", ""10.1093/bioinformatics/btz371"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17465-1_19"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0066031"", ""10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003306"", ""10.1007/3-540-40922-X_4"", ""10.1186/s12859-019-2798-1"", ""10.1016/j.sbi.2004.05.003"", ""10.1109/TC.1986.1676819"", ""10.1016/S1567-8326(02)00067-X"", ""10.1186/1752-0509-7-135"", ""10.1007/978-1-61779-361-5_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-12982-2_10"", ""10.1007/s11047-019-09748-4"", ""10.1137/1.9781611975031.151"", ""10.1016/j.cell.2012.02.031"", ""10.1186/s12918-016-0338-4"", ""10.1007/3-540-45319-9_23"", ""10.1007/s10009-005-0188-7"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.97.042308"", ""10.1109/TCYB.2020.3022430"", ""10.1038/s41598-020-60251-8"", ""10.1093/bioinformatics/btn336"", ""10.1126/science.238.4827.632"", ""10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003286"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0094258"", ""10.1186/1752-0509-6-96"", ""10.1016/j.semcdb.2009.07.003"", ""10.1016/0022-5193(69)90015-0"", ""10.1038/srep02223"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11520-7_59"", ""10.1007/s11047-015-9520-7"", ""10.1093/bioinformatics/btw682"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.72.055101"", ""10.1007/11590156_44"", ""10.1093/nar/gkj092"", ""10.1038/nrm2766"", ""10.1109/TCBB.2019.2914383"", ""10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110257"", ""10.3389/fphys.2018.01161"", ""10.1109/TCBB.2018.2850901"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-75140-3_16"", ""10.1142/S0218127408021816"", ""10.1038/s41597-019-0340-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31304-3_2"", ""10.1145/3233547.3233550"", ""10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006538"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_42"", ""10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.07.022"", ""10.1073/pnas.1810141115"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30446-1_20"", ""10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa752"", ""10.1016/0022-5193(73)90247-6"", ""10.1038/sj.embor.7400090"", ""10.1109/43.875347"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2019.05.001"", ""10.1007/s11334-011-0146-3""]","['Neuroscience', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']","['Molecular Biology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Formal analysis of these systems is particularly challenging due to the complexity of the perception DNNs, the sensors (cameras), and the environment conditions. We present a case study applying formal probabilistic analysis techniques to an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using a perception DNN. We address the above challenges by replacing the camera and the network with a compact abstraction whose transition probabilities are computed from the confusion matrices measuring the performance of the DNN on a representative image data set. As the probabilities are estimated based on empirical data, and thus are subject to error, we also compute confidence intervals in addition to point estimates for these probabilities and thereby strengthen the soundness of the analysis. We also show how to leverage local, DNN-specific analyses as run-time guards to filter out mis-behaving inputs and increase the safety of the overall system. Our findings are applicable to other autonomous systems that use complex DNNs for perception.","[{""name"": ""Corina S.

The idea was an outgrowth of colonial representations forged since the end of the nineteenth century. It was first formulated by the French authorities in secret discussions with the representatives of the Casamance in the context of the 1958 referendum. It was taken over by local political leaders who saw it as a possible answer to the debates over representation that arose in the post-war process of democratization, and later by proponents of political mobilization at the sub-regional level after independence. By examining this little-known moment of possibility, the article shows that the claims of the current armed independence movement are in fact part of a longer, more ambivalent history in which a separatist imaginary of the Casamance took shape.","[{""name"": ""SÉVERINE AWENENGO DALBERTO"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/9789004245754"", ""10.1017/S0021853716000050"", ""10.2307/2168387"", ""10.1111/nana.12448"", ""10.1080/03086534.2014.894716"", ""10.3917/rhsh.024.0077"", ""10.3917/afco.235.0073"", ""10.1016/j.jhg.2009.12.002"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004139831.i-433"", ""10.1017/S0021853709990053"", ""10.1017/S0021853708003915"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511584091""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Our analysis is stated as a type-and-effect system for a first-order functional programming language with support for sampling over discrete distributions, non-deterministic choice and a ticking operator. The latter allows for the specification of fine-grained cost models. We state two soundness theorems based on two different—but strongly related—typing rules of ticking, which account differently for the cost of non-terminating computations.

This approach allows for faster and more homogeneous configuration of a complete infrastructure. Infrastructure as Code languages, such as CloudFormation or TerraForm, use a declarative model so that users only need to describe the desired state of the infrastructure. However, in practice, these languages are not processed atomically. During an upgrade, the infrastructure goes through a series of intermediate states. We identify a security vulnerability that occurs during an upgrade even when the initial and final states of the infrastructure are secure, and we show that those vulnerability are possible in Amazon’s AWS and Google Cloud. We call such attacks intra-update sniping vulnerabilities. In order to mitigate this shortcoming, we present a technique that detects such vulnerabilities and pinpoints the root causes of insecure deployment migrations. We implement this technique in a tool, Häyhä, that uses dataflow graph analysis. We evaluate our tool on a set of open-source CloudFormation templates and find that it is scalable and could be used as part of a deployment workflow.","[{""name"": ""Julien Lepiller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ruzica Piskac"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Schäf"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Santolucito"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/ICNP.2009.5339690"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8602994"", ""10.1145/2594291.2594317"", ""10.1109/MSR.2017.67"", ""10.1145/3274694.3274736"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_3"", ""10.1145/512950.512973"", ""10.1145/2767181"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66706-5_15"", ""10.1145/3230543.3230582"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10936-7_15"", ""10.1145/3290388"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99725-4_6"", ""10.1145/3290381"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2019.00033"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2019.00033"", ""10.1145/3133888"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41540-6_5"", ""10.1145/2908080.2908083""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

When individuals appeal to “places animated with prayer” for the transformative energy that resides there through ritualized practices, they reaffirm an affective atmosphere of religiosity. In Orthodox Eastern Europe and elsewhere, a confessional tradition is allied with state borders, further normativizing this affective atmosphere and giving it pronounced political implications. When an affective atmosphere of religiosity inspires practices that are intentionally designed to prompt experiences rendered meaningful in otherworldly terms, over time such performativity can create mimetic instincts that become second nature. This is an essential step to religion becoming an expedient political resource and to the emergence of religious nationalism or a confessional state.","[{""name"": ""Catherine Wanner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1525/var.1994.10.1.155"", ""10.1111/1467-9655.12210"", ""10.1017/S0010417518000282"", ""10.2307/j.ctvw04ht5"", ""10.2307/j.ctt21c4sww"", ""10.14506/ca32.2.05"", ""10.1515/9780773589650"", ""10.1515/9781501757846"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-34144-6"", ""10.1111/amet.12169"", ""10.1093/jaarel/lfx055"", ""10.2307/j.ctt13wwz5x"", ""10.1515/9780804785532"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wrcc6"", ""10.1177/1474474015569994"", ""10.1016/j.emospa.2009.08.005"", ""10.1353/sor.2009.0064"", ""10.3167/9781845456177"", ""10.1353/book.16014"", ""10.1017/S0010417519000094"", ""10.1515/9780691214283"", ""10.1086/695387"", ""10.1215/9780822388463"", ""10.3167/9781845450571"", ""10.1017/S0010417517000469"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1425.2011.01355.x"", ""10.1525/california/9780982329412.001.0001"", ""10.1068/d393t"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226190204.001.0001"", ""10.1215/08992363-2683621"", ""10.3167/sa.2011.550301"", ""10.1525/9780520940048"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199332120.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1352.2012.01266.x"", ""10.1111/amet.12139""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Geography, Planning and Development', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The model presents a linear unfolding view of economic development from primitive to advanced stages. But Smith’s own historical examples systematically contradict this model. I thus question whether Adam Smith actually endorses and uses the four stages model of development to illustrate development and suggest that if he does, he does it to discredit it instead.

Comprehensive geophysical knowledge required cooperation between researchers on every part of the planet, leading practitioners to tout transnational earth science – despite direct military applications in an age of submarines and ballistic missiles – as a non-political form of peaceful universalism. This article examines the 1957–58 International Geophysical Year as a powerful fulcrum in the transfer of ideas about Earth’s global environment from Western security establishments to conservationists worldwide. For eighteen months, tens of thousands of researchers across every continent pooled resources for data collection to create a scientific benchmark for future comparisons. Illuminating Earth as dynamic and interconnected, participants robustly conceptualized humanity’s emergence as a geophysical force, capable of ‘artificially’ modifying the natural world. Studies of anthropogenic geophysics, including satellites, nuclear fallout, and climate change, conditioned the global rise of environmentalism.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin W.

This growing body of work is far from monolithic, generating alternative theories that should structure scholarly debate going forward. Central issues include whether civilizational identity is primarily elite led or mass driven, whether it inherently involves conflictual human impulses, what the role of religion and values are in driving it, what its relationship is to nationalism, and how similarly we can expect the countries and people who share civilizational identity to behave. We also find emerging debates on what this newly conceptualized civilizational identity explains in contemporary world politics. Social scientists are now only beginning to apply important tools of social science to this question, with even public opinion research in its infancy. Early findings suggest civilizational identity may be shaping not only elite foreign policy making but also patterns of domestic politics, including the recent rise of populism and levels of democracy and authoritarianism more generally.","[{""name"": ""Henry E.

In presenting personal accounts of three activists and situating them within the milieus in which they are active, it sheds light on a variety of factors that push youth to engage in far-right militancy. Many researchers of far-right extremism have asserted the need to provide more in-depth knowledge on far-right militants, yet there remain important gaps that this article strives to address. First, it demonstrates the value of the ethnographic approach in the study of far right, which offers unique insights into the motivations for involvement and the relations between ideas, beliefs, and practices. Second, it shows the importance of situating present-day activism in a historical context, not only by looking for long-term patterns but also by paying attention to the ways studied actors engage with historical comparisons. Third, in engaging critically with some commonsensical approaches to far-right activists, the paper suggests that ethnographic studies of far-right activism can give us fresh perspectives on broader social phenomena beyond the far right per se.","[{""name"": ""Agnieszka Pasieka"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/000169939904200405"", ""10.7591/9781501722141"", ""10.1017/S0960777300003520"", ""10.1177/089124396010006002"", ""10.1017/mit.2017.51"", ""10.1111/AN.584"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195101010.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13691830601154237"", ""10.14318/hau7.1.012"", ""10.17356/ieejsp.v6i4.662"", ""10.1163/22116257-00602002"", ""10.1177/002200946600100107"", ""10.4000/terrain.18955"", ""10.1353/see.2006.0065"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102602"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190212599.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-8322.12480"", ""10.4159/9780674245471"", ""10.3917/dec.bizeu.2003.01"", ""10.1086/703199"", ""10.2307/2928816"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.1017/S0018246X08007140"", ""10.1177/0038038510375740"", ""10.3167/fcl.2019.840105"", ""10.7765/9781526114013"", ""10.1111/1467-8322.12235""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This article argues that the Criminal Law Amendment Act (CLAA) 1885, the Act that raised the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen, and its application were driven by constructions of gender in conjunction with those of social class and working class family. The article firstly argues that CLAA 1885 and related campaigns reinforced class boundaries, and largely framed the working class family as absent, thereby, requiring the law to step in as a surrogate parent to protect the girl child. Secondly, the paper focuses on narratives emerging from the archives and argues that while narratives of capacity and protection in particular were key concepts behind reforms, the courts showed limited understanding of these terms. Instead, the courts focused on notions resistance, consent, and untrustworthiness of the victim, even when these concepts were not relevant to the proceedings due to victims' young age.","[{""name"": ""Laura Lammasniemi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9781843147992"", ""10.36019/9780813541020"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199280919.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108774543.010"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbw040"", ""10.1057/9781137441720"", ""10.1093/hwj/dby021"", ""10.1177/026272809201200202"", ""10.2307/3178642"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0424.2011.01676.x"", ""10.1057/9780230505933"", ""10.1080/13645579.2012.688330"", ""10.1057/9780230505933"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195063387.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226081014.001.0001"", ""10.1023/A:1001986103125""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

We present , the successor of the delta debugger . is the current de-facto standard delta debugger for the SMT-LIBv2 language. Our tool improves and extends core concepts of and extends input language support to the entire family of SMT-LIBv2 language dialects.

10.1017/jbr.2021.188,JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES,0603 World History,"Youth Sexuality, Responsibility, and the Opening of the Brook Advisory Centres in London and Birmingham in the 1960s","AbstractThis article takes the opening of the Brook Advisory Centres in London (1964) and Birmingham (1966) as a comparative case study for exploring the public debate on youth sexuality. The two centers were the first in postwar Britain specifically dedicated to the provision of advice on birth control and emotional problems to unmarried and young people. By focusing on an initiative that launched amid rising concerns over illegitimacy and promiscuity, the article engages with the debate over social change in the 1960s and the so-called permissive society. The author argues that the notion of responsibility became a key paradigm for supporters of a new sexual culture. Combining archival material, media analysis, and oral history interviews, the author shows that in constructing the need for a service for unmarried people, the Brook Advisory Centres faced accusations of encouraging promiscuity. Their main line of defense was the production of a narrative that stressed the notion of responsibility and moral guidance for unmarried people in avoiding unwanted babies. And in the debate around youth sexuality, locality mattered. In Birmingham, the prospect of formal contraceptive advice for unmarried girls was violently opposed by church members and family-planning doctors, whereas London witnessed the creation of a viable discourse with an emphasis on sexual responsibility.","[{""name"": ""Caroline Rusterholz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/tcbh/hwq048"", ""10.1093/hwj/35.1.95"", ""10.1136/bmj.1.5124.784-a"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwr005"", ""10.1080/09612025.2018.1482656"", ""10.1080/13619462.2019.1621170"", ""10.1080/13619468808580986"", ""10.1080/03071022.2013.872904""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

This paper proposes a process mining approach to decompose the waiting time observed in each activity transition into multiple direct causes and to analyze the impact of each identified cause on the cycle time efficiency of the process. An empirical evaluation shows that the proposed approach is able to discover different direct causes of waiting times. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated in a real-life process.","[{""name"": ""Katsiaryna Lashkevich"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fredrik Milani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Chapela-Campa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ihar Suvorau"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marlon Dumas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-662-49851-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-67274-8_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37453-2_47"", ""10.1109/ICPM49681.2020.00019"", ""10.1016/j.is.2015.07.003"", ""10.1108/IMDS-09-2016-0393"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-56509-4"", ""10.1177/14604582221077195"", ""10.1016/j.compind.2015.02.009"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59536-8_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-05760-1_14"", ""10.4121/uuid:68726926-5ac5-4fab-b873-ee76ea412399"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-16103-2_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-42887-1_21"", ""10.1016/j.is.2020.101642"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2003.07.015"", ""10.1016/j.is.2015.03.010"", ""10.1109/ICPM49681.2020.00014"", ""10.1016/j.is.2006.05.003"", ""10.1109/CIDM.2011.5949453"", ""10.1109/JCSSE.2016.7748865""]","['Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Management Information Systems', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Among other things, competence frameworks have been developed for practical orientation and to describe required skills. However, the reflective handling of the now widespread phenomena of the “AI world” requires different competencies than the handling of conventional informatics systems mainly discussed so far, because “AI systems” are based on a different design approach that gives these systems special properties. This, in turn, poses new demands on the professionalization of all teachers, since the development has clear implications for their central areas of action. The goal of this paper is to define a framework that outlines these new AI-related requirements to support the design of holistic education and study programs for teaching in the digitally networked “AI world” that give equal weight to the user-oriented, technological, socio-cultural perspective. This contribution approaches the topic theoretically: first, the need to delineate an area of AI-related digital competencies is justified. Then this area is located in the DPACK model. Since teachers combine pedagogical, subject-related, and technical competencies in their work, the domains of “AI related Pedagogical Knowledge"" (AI-PK), “AI related Content Knowledge"" (AI-CK), and “AI related Pedagogical Content Knowledge"" (AI-PCK) are deductively determined and illustrated with exemplary competencies. The “AI-PACK” framework enables a structured description and investigation of AI teacher education requirements.","[{""name"": ""Uwe Lorenz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ralf Romeike"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/d41586-023-02361-7"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2022.107468"", ""10.1145/3556787.3556790"", ""10.1145/3502718.3524782"", ""10.36950/bzl.39.2021.9217"", ""10.1111/ejed.12533"", ""10.1007/978-981-16-8193-6"", ""10.1007/s13218-021-00731-9"", ""10.1162/daed_e_01897"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-43393-1_19"", ""10.3102/0013189X015002004"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11256-5"", ""10.1145/3488042.3488053"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097962"", ""10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433"", ""10.54691/bcpep.v3i.28""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

However, scholars of Ukrainian language and identity matters had for years demonstrated an increased civic attachment of Ukrainian citizens, including Russian speakers, and its greater salience compared with ethnic, linguistic, and regional identifications. This article seeks to highlight the main accomplishments and challenges of research on Ukrainian ethnic and national identity. It focuses on a gradual shift from the essentialist understanding of ethnicity as embodied in bounded groups to the interest in individuals’ contextually determined identifications by categories with a changing meaning. Another prominent part of the analysis is the relationship between Ukrainian ethnic and national identity and the amalgamation of these two apparently distinct phenomena into what I propose to call ethnonational identity.","[{""name"": ""Volodymyr Kulyk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/146879680100100304"", ""10.2747/1060-586X.24.3.232"", ""10.1080/09668136.2020.1719043"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1451232"", ""10.1080/15348458.2016.1166432"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598876"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107286191.010"", ""10.1111/1469-8219.00037"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1452247"", ""10.1080/0966813032000161437"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1174980"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558764"", ""10.1080/13691830601043554"", ""10.1080/00905990802373488"", ""10.1080/09668136.2017.1379054"", ""10.1080/10889388.2001.10641161"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1447769"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2001.10641498"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1452181"", ""10.1080/09668136.2018.1549653"", ""10.2753/PPC1075-8216540604"", ""10.1080/09668139708412476"", ""10.1080/14608944.2019.1642862"", ""10.2307/3650067"", ""10.1080/00085006.2009.11092603"", ""10.1080/0090599042000186179"", ""10.1080/00905990020009674"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2020.1851541"", ""10.1080/09668130802532894"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00019"", ""10.1080/09668139408412161"", ""10.1080/00905992.2012.747498"", ""10.1080/09668139608412401"", ""10.1111/nana.12782"", ""10.2747/1060-586X.18.3.213"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1452209"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00493.x"", ""10.1080/09668130220129542""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Language and Linguistics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

A one-standard-deviation increase in market access reduced average stature by 0.14 inches, and rising market access over the study period can explain 37 percent of the contemporaneous decline in average stature, known as theAntebellum Puzzle.

The curfew bent normal rules and attenuated supposedly universal rights, overtly discriminating between people on the basis of class and race. Rules that legally defined the nighttime did not come from any national statute, or from newly independent Brazil's liberal Constitution (1824) or its Criminal Code (1830). Instead, Rio's nocturnal sociolegal world was the product of police edicts, on-the-ground policing practice, and city ordinances. It also emerged from the actions of people who used the darker hours for work, play, and resistance against oppression, especially members of the city's immense enslaved population and the growing number of free persons of African descent. In other words, this is a phenomenon of urban governance that allows, and indeed forces us to look beyond the nineteenth-century nation-state to understand the exercise of power at a local level. This article explores how the curfew established patterns and means of limiting the basic freedom to move about the city. It was at night when both the necessity and fragility of what jurists in Brazil called the “freedom to come and go” came into view. The daily transition between day and night enacted juridical changes that, although invisible at the national level, fundamentally shaped the social categories that determined people's places in society in ways that historical research has yet to explore.","[{""name"": ""Amy Chazkel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/9780822387022"", ""10.1590/S0102-01882012000200004"", ""10.1515/9780691196206"", ""10.1590/1806-93472015v35n69006"", ""10.2307/1864376"", ""10.1590/S0102-69092012000100010"", ""10.1515/9780804765534"", ""10.1515/9780804771252"", ""10.1215/9780822384731"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316460054"", ""10.1080/14043850500399249"", ""10.7312/beni17186"", ""10.1525/nclr.2010.13.2.216"", ""10.1093/past/38.1.56"", ""10.5007/1984-9222.2013v5n9p3"", ""10.1215/9780822380788"", ""10.1080/13507480902916928"", ""10.2752/174589312X13173255802030"", ""10.2307/3177712"", ""10.1215/9780822386476-006"", ""10.1215/0961754X-11-2-264"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226015675.001.0001"", ""10.5007/1984-9222.2017v9n18p63"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01051.x"", ""10.1057/9780230611115"", ""10.1017/S0020859009990356"", ""10.7560/313558"", ""10.5007/1984-9222.2017v9n17p63"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511977695"", ""10.4324/9781315881614"", ""10.1515/9781503627109"", ""10.1017/S0022216X9700477X"", ""10.1093/ejil/chl020"", ""10.1111/j.0964-0282.2007.00010.x"", ""10.1093/ahr/118.5.1376""]",['Social Sciences'],['Urban Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1017/S1740022819000342,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY,0603 World History,"The Trading with the Enemy Acts in the age of expropriation, 1914-49","AbstractThis article examines one of the most consequential legal–political models for the confiscation of private property in the twentieth century: the Trading with the Enemy Acts (TEAs). Two laws with this name were passed in Britain (1914) and the United States (1917), enabling the large-scale expropriation of ‘enemies’ and ‘aliens’. The extra-territorial application of these laws during the era of total war led to the globalization of its paradigm of expropriation in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. The TEAs made the administrative process of dispossession effective and profitable for liberal states. The US law was repurposed for domestic use during the New Deal, while its British counterpart played an unforeseen role during decolonization and the great partitions of the late 1940s, as the nascent nation-states of India, Pakistan, and Israel used it to constitute themselves as territorial and economic units by taking land and property from ‘evacuees’ and ‘absentees’. The article provides a short history of these four national cases in their international context and argues that the history of the TEAs shows that state-driven mass expropriation was much more common throughout the mid twentieth century than usually supposed; the ‘age of extremes’ was also in part an ‘age of expropriation’.","[{""name"": ""Nicholas Mulder"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1111955"", ""10.1017/CBO9781108164559"", ""10.1080/00263206.2018.1559157"", ""10.20378/irb-41509"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511563256.009"", ""10.2307/j.ctt9qcws9"", ""10.2979/lawandlegality.0.0.00"", ""10.1068/d402"", ""10.1080/096922998347552"", ""10.17104/1611-8944_2014_4_448"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511497339"", ""10.1086/532667"", ""10.1017/mah.2018.12"", ""10.2307/1335960"", ""10.17104/1611-8944_2014_4_523"", ""10.1080/00856409508723242"", ""10.1057/9780230374287"", ""10.3138/cjh.32.2.201"", ""10.1353/tlj.2005.0030"", ""10.1017/S0022050700009451"", ""10.17104/1611-8944_2014_4_500"", ""10.13109/gege.2014.40.2.214"", ""10.2307/1275058"", ""10.1080/00076799000000048"", ""10.2979/jottturstuass.2.1.147"", ""10.7312/fisc12978"", ""10.1515/9781400831661-005"", ""10.1515/9781400829330""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Focused on Kalimpong, this article traces the trajectory of one technology of settlement, agricultural extension, from the late 1880s to the early 1940s. It highlights agricultural extension's racialized and gendered politics, as well as its implication in a long-term project that merged material (i.e., food) provision with social reproduction (i.e., childrearing, kin-making). Agricultural extension created a patchwork of relatively biodiverse small farms that historical and contemporary accounts describe as a “green belt”: a socio-ecological outside to the plantation monocultures that dominate the hills. British governors attempted to use non-plantation space for multiple ends. In this sense, their work might be termed “biopolitical,” in that it was geared toward supporting and amplifying the life chances of certain human bodies and certain botanical species. Through a series of experiments, colonial agents made calculated choices about which of these forms of life should be made to flourish, and which might be allowed to perish. Importantly, settlement, as a set of intertwined projects, did not unfold in a coherent or deliberately sequential manner. Settlement was, and continues to be, a sedimentary process.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Besky"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/025764301002500203"", ""10.1215/s12280-009-9092-7"", ""10.1080/09584935.2018.1471041"", ""10.4159/9780674020221"", ""10.1177/0019464617745924"", ""10.3167/TRANS.2018.080306"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8306.1995.tb01821.x"", ""10.5040/9781474299534"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199463558.001.0001"", ""10.7312/bear14002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199277964.001.0001"", ""10.1111/amet.12561"", ""10.1080/09614524.2015.1029438"", ""10.1177/0263775820912757"", ""10.1215/9780822399759"", ""10.1111/cuag.12085"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-4654-4"", ""10.1215/9780822377719"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316227367"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139150910"", ""10.1017/9781108687034"", ""10.1080/03066159208438494"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8330.2009.00717.x"", ""10.25158/L5.1.7"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226043388.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00472336.2016.1185796"", ""10.1215/9780822389781"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469637150.001.0001"", ""10.1353/cch.2004.0002"", ""10.1177/1463499616636269"", ""10.23943/9781400889280"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199483556.003.0002"", ""10.1002/9781119412090"", ""10.1353/book22382"", ""10.2458/v25i1.22387"", ""10.1002/9780470712955"", ""10.7135/UPO9781843313670"", ""10.4159/9780674058828"", ""10.1525/9780520311008"", ""10.1215/07990537-1189530"", ""10.9783/9780812202427"", ""10.1080/03066150.2018.1534833"", ""10.1080/00045600802118426"", ""10.2458/v25i1.23089"", ""10.1215/9780822373216"", ""10.1515/9781503617995"", ""10.1215/08992363-15-1-11"", ""10.1111/j.1471-0366.2005.00110.x"", ""10.1080/14623520601056240"", ""10.2458/v25i1.22385""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

This article posits itself at the crossroads between fascist studies, Habsburg studies, and scholarship on post-1918 violence. In this regard, the difficulties of the state transition, the subsequent social unrest, and the ascent of new forms of political radicalism in post-Habsburg Trieste are a case in point. Rather than focusing on the “national strife” between “Italians” and “Slavs,” this article will concentrate on the unstable local relations between state and civil society, which led to multiple cycles of conflict and crisis. One of the arguments it makes is that in post-1918 Trieste, where the different nationalist groups contended for a space characterized by multiple loyalties and allegiances, Fascists claimed to be the movement of the “true Italians,” identified with the Fascists and their sympathizers. Accordingly, while targeting the alleged enemies of the “Italian nation” (defined as “Bolsheviks,” “Austrophiles,” and “Slavs”), they aimed to polarize the Italian-speaking community along different political fault lines to reconfigure relations between the state and civil society.","[{""name"": ""Marco Bresciani"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9781315641324"", ""10.1057/9781137384416"", ""10.2307/j.ctvw04hnr"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199654918.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108560955"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199583713.001.0001"", ""10.1524/9783486857566""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Between 1980 and 2010 global oil consumption increased by 50 per cent, while both coal and natural gas consumption nearly doubled. North Sea oil represented a crucial, if never openly acknowledged, ally for Thatcher, serving the purpose of bringing down oil prices, while at the same time achieving other crucial policy goals.The advent of the British North Sea oil weakened OPEC control of the global oil market, helped crush the resistance of the British coal miners, fed the ‘de-nationalisation’ of British energy sector, and then contributed to promote the ‘neoliberal governance’ of the EU energy sector.","[{""name"": ""Giuliano Garavini"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1257/jep.5.2.111"", ""10.1017/S0008938917001017"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0270.1981.tb01400.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjk2x23""]","['Energy', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'General Energy']","[[('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.6919), ('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.6893)]]"

10.1017/S0018246X19000062,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,THE MEMORY OF THE GREAT WAR AND MORALE DURING BRITAIN'S PHONEY WAR,"AbstractThis article examines the memory of the Great War and the underexplored topic of morale during the Phoney War, and contributes to, and connects, their historiographies. Analysis of previously unexamined Mass Observation (MO) material confirms and qualifies some of the concerns about morale that MO expressed at the time. It also reveals that many Britons looked backwards to the Great War during the Phoney War, whether they had lived through the Great War or not, and their memories and understandings of the Great War informed their attitudes to the Second World War. Memories of wartime trauma were just one facet of the varied legacy of the Great War that Britons drew upon. Importantly, Britons of different ages drew upon post-war representations and personal and vicarious experiences to different extents, but those who were able to typically ascribed influence to personal rather than cultural memories of the Great War. This complicates the assumption that the latter determined Britons’ responses to the outbreak of the Second World War and contributes to understandings of both the reception and influence of cultural representations of the Great War, and the place of the Great War in the subjective worlds of Britons during the Second World War.","[{""name"": ""JOEL MORLEY"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-33476-9_7"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496158"", ""10.1080/09612029400200044"", ""10.1017/S0018246X05004930"", ""10.1017/S0963926899000152"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139021197"", ""10.1080/13619460802439366"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwu034"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719058936.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9798400694738"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwx063"", ""10.1057/9780230597181"", ""10.1086/649767"", ""10.1057/9780230503144"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199241170.001.0001"", ""10.1179/007817296790175191"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199671045.001.0001"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719086168.001.0001"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300170757.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199574667.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14780038.2017.1314579"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511557873.008"", ""10.1093/ehr/XCV.CCCLXXVII.810"", ""10.1086/663841"", ""10.1177/0047244115599146"", ""10.1017/S0147547902000194"", ""10.1017/S095679330000145X""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

It shows that Brazil's inequality was not always high, but rather followed a Kuznets curve, increasing from the early 20thcentury, reaching a high plateau between the 1970s and 1990s and declining thereafter. Notably, results highlight the importance of both economic and political factors for enabling the completion of the second Kuznets curve phase.","[{""name"": ""María Gómez León"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S1361491608002311"", ""10.1017/S021261091700009X"", ""10.4159/9780674984769"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-6719"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-44621-9_3"", ""10.1017/S0022216X16000341"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77j93"", ""10.4159/9780674242852"", ""10.1017/S0212610900002287"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2009.01.008"", ""10.14201/alh.7557"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511756078"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9957.1954.tb00021.x"", ""10.1017/S1365100507070137"", ""10.18356/e24b37c4-en"", ""10.1017/S0022050700005969"", ""10.1007/s11698-016-0150-9"", ""10.1017/S0212610910000091"", ""10.1017/S0022050700072430"", ""10.1353/lar.2005.0040"", ""10.1353/eco.2002.0013"", ""10.1257/aer.91.5.1369"", ""10.1017/S0022050713000028"", ""10.1017/S021261091000011X"", ""10.1111/ehr.12770"", ""10.1017/S0022050705050035"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4968.003.0014"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817397"", ""10.1016/0304-3878(93)90035-L"", ""10.2307/2527439"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2005.07.008"", ""10.1016/0014-4983(82)90009-2"", ""10.1016/S0304-3878(98)00099-6"", ""10.1016/S0165-1765(02)00205-7"", ""10.4159/9780674969797"", ""10.1016/S1698-6989(05)70022-9"", ""10.1017/S0212610900000185"", ""10.2307/2598128"", ""10.1515/9781503622500-013"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00407.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4991.2006.00198.x"", ""10.1162/003355302320935025"", ""10.1016/0304-3878(76)90027-4"", ""10.1023/A:1009850119329"", ""10.1016/0014-4983(83)90044-X"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004175914.i-294"", ""10.1093/ereh/hes019"", ""10.2307/165739"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3310.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822379812"", ""10.1017/S0212610910000078"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02403.x"", ""10.1007/s10109-009-0094-8"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107337046"", ""10.4159/9780674369542"", ""10.1257/jep.14.3.217"", ""10.1111/ehr.12613""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The case ofKiongozi(The Guide or The Leader) relates this scholarship to Tanzania's colonial past. Published between 1904 and 1916 by the government of what was then German East Africa, the paper played an ambivalent role. On the one hand, by promoting the shift from Swahili written in Arabic script (ajami) to Latinized Swahili, it became the mouthpiece of an African elite trained in government schools. By reading and writing forKiongozi, thesewaletaji wa habari(bearers of news) spread Swahili inland and transformed coastal culture. On the other hand, the paper served the power of the colonial state by mediating between German colonizers and their indigenous subordinates. Beyond cooptation,Kiongozihighlights the warped nature of African voices in the colonial archive, questioning claims about print's impact on nationalism and new forms of selfhood.","[{""name"": ""Fabian Krautwald"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781316104620"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004183421.i-325"", ""10.1080/00020184.2011.628800"", ""10.1353/jhi.2020.0004"", ""10.2307/3097435"", ""10.1017/S0021853700007982"", ""10.1017/S0165115320000248"", ""10.1515/9780824876692"", ""10.1017/S002185370001820X"", ""10.1017/S0021853703008545"", ""10.1017/S000197201000001X"", ""10.3998/mpub.8833121"", ""10.1515/9781580466974-009"", ""10.2307/523760"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtt002""]",['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X19000682,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,THE AUTHORITY OF FEELING IN MID-TWENTIETH-CENTURY ENGLISH CONSERVATISM,"AbstractConservatism claims to be a philosophy of common sense and everyday experience, in which sensation takes priority over reason. This article asks how this was understood by both Conservative thinkers and grassroots members in mid-twentieth-century England, and how it sat alongside other ways of understanding the feelings and experiences of ordinary people, in a period in which these came to be regarded as a privileged form of political authority. The article shows that the Conservative everyday was rooted in individual sensory experiences, but always underpinned by the collective evocation of reverence, majesty, and awe. It traces understandings of the everyday and the awesome through political texts and grassroots publications, showing that the tension between them is what gives Conservatism its distinctive character. This is conceptualized in Burkean terms as the beautiful and the sublime. The latter guarantees order, hierarchy, and allegiance, while the former works to soften and socialize power – making it seem a matter of custom and common sense. The article suggests that this combination enabled Conservatism to adapt to the challenges of mass democracy but became ever harder to sustain in the emotional culture of post-war England, when feelings became a marker of personal authenticity, rather than cultural authority.","[{""name"": ""EMILY ROBINSON"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/tcbh/hwx006"", ""10.1525/9780520962866"", ""10.7765/9781526126566"", ""10.1057/9780230377929"", ""10.1017/S0080440118000099"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139022057"", ""10.1093/ehr/cew237"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198799429.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198205937.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0018246X14000429"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198812579.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0018246X08007164"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511553479"", ""10.1093/ehr/CVIII.428.629"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199667987.001.0001"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719086496.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0018246X15000114"", ""10.1093/tcbh/7.1.27"", ""10.1111/1469-8676.12283"", ""10.1093/tcbh/5.2.129"", ""10.1093/ehr/cew052"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511998164.010"", ""10.1017/9781108641357"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbt014"", ""10.1057/9781137092427_15"", ""10.1111/hith.12061"", ""10.1093/hwj/28.1.53"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719071645.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['History', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

We develop a new framework,pattern rule sets(PRSs), which describe sequences of deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that approximate a non-regular language. We present an algorithm for recovering the PRS behind a sequence of such automata, and apply it to the sequences of automata extracted from trained RNNs using the$$L^{*}$$L∗algorithm. We then show how the PRS may converted into a CFG, enabling a familiar and useful presentation of the learned language.Extracting the learned language of an RNN is important to facilitate understanding of the RNN and to verify its correctness. Furthermore, the extracted CFG can augment the RNN in classifying correct sentences, as the RNN’s predictive accuracy decreases when the recursion depth and distance between matching delimiters of its input sequences increases.","[{""name"": ""Daniel M.

It is discussed which types of technology can be developed and certified already today on the basis of existing railway standards. Other essential technologies, however, require modifications or extensions of existing standards, in order to provide a certification basis for introducing these technologies into non-experimental “real-world” rail operation. Regarding these, we check the novel pre-standard ANSI/UL 4600 with respect to suitability as a certification basis for safety-critical autonomous train control functions based on methods from artificial intelligence. As a thought experiment, we propose a novel autonomous train controller design and perform an evaluation according to ANSI/UL 4600.

This process is repeated from scratch independently for each input (e.g., image) and perturbation (e.g., rotation), leading to an expensive overall proof effort when handling an entire dataset. In this work, we introduce a new method for reducing this verification cost without losing precision based on a key insight that abstractions obtained at intermediate layers for different inputs and perturbations can overlap or contain each other. Leveraging our insight, we introduce the general concept of shared certificates, enabling proof effort reuse across multiple inputs to reduce overall verification costs. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of shared certificates in reducing the verification cost on a range of datasets and attack specifications on image classifiers including the popular patch and geometric perturbations.

Assessments of Savarkar's earlierThe Indian War of Independence(1909), a history of the 1857 Indian “Mutiny,” have generally subsumed this tract into the logic of Hindutva. This article offers a reassessment ofThe Indian War of Independenceand situates it within the political and intellectual context offin de sièclewestern India. I suggest that this history of Indian rebellion propagated a novel iteration of Indian popular sovereignty predicated on Hindu–Muslim unity. I read Savarkar as adapting the ideas of Giuseppe Mazzini and Johann Kaspar Bluntschli to challenge what he regarded as the fissiparous logic of late colonial liberalism. Finally, this article argues that Savarkar's account of the mutual constitution of general will and the personalism of sovereignty must be read as a previously unacknowledged instance of Indian populism.","[{""name"": ""Vikram Visana"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/pastj/gtt006"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511988905"", ""10.1515/9781400835072"", ""10.1177/0257643013496688"", ""10.1017/S0018246X15000230"", ""10.1177/025764300001600104"", ""10.1215/1089201X-7493887"", ""10.1353/bh.2001.0007"", ""10.1017/S1479244306001077"", ""10.1080/03086534.2018.1431435"", ""10.1215/1089201X-23-1-2-271"", ""10.1080/00856401.2015.1055422"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511975066"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000601"", ""10.1080/14649373.2014.882087"", ""10.4324/9780429299209"", ""10.1215/08992363-2009-020"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674068100"", ""10.1080/13688790.2013.823257"", ""10.1017/S1479244310000144"", ""10.3390/rel3020407"", ""10.1017/S1479244310000156"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.1968.tb01332.x"", ""10.1080/0307102032000082525""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This paper proposes an SMT-based translation validation framework for Multi-Level IR (MLIR), a compiler framework used by many deep learning compilers. It proposes an SMT encoding tailored for translation validation that is an over-approximation of the FP arithmetic and reduction operations. It performs abstraction refinement if validation fails. We also propose a new approach for encoding arithmetic properties of reductions in SMT. We found mismatches between the specification and implementation of MLIR, and validated high-level transformations for , , and with proper splitting.","[{""name"": ""Seongwon Bang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Seunghyeon Nam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Inwhan Chun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ho Young Jhoo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juneyoung Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25543-5_10"", ""10.1109/ARITH.2011.40"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17462-0_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25543-5_8"", ""10.1109/FMCAD.2009.5351141"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_42"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314596"", ""10.1145/3527328"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73368-3_52"", ""10.1145/3428289"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_2"", ""10.1109/FMCAD.2015.7542257"", ""10.1145/2535838.2535841"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_35"", ""10.1145/3158135"", ""10.1145/3498717"", ""10.1145/3453483.3454030"", ""10.1109/FMCAD.2009.5351142"", ""10.1145/349299.349314"", ""10.1145/3468264.3468591"", ""10.1145/3230733"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-159"", ""10.1145/1993316.1993533"", ""10.1145/3519939.3523437"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94205-6_17"", ""10.1145/3437984.3458838""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Hardware and Architecture']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)]]"

Possibilities, challenges, practices","AbstractThe nature of Ireland's place within the British Empire continues to attract significant public and scholarly attention. While historians of Ireland have long accepted the complexity of Ireland's imperial past as both colonised and coloniser, the broader public debate has grown more heated in recent months, buffeted by Brexit, the Decade of Centenaries and global events. At the same time, the imperatives of social movements such as Black Lives Matter and Decolonising the Curriculum have asked us to reflect on the assumptions, hierarchies and norms underpinning the structures of society, including the production of knowledge and the higher education system. This round table brings together scholars from diverse disciplinary and methodological backgrounds to examine the prospects, possibilities and challenges of what decolonising Irish history might mean for our field. It sets these discussions within broader frameworks, considering both the relationship of Irish historical writing to postcolonial theory and the developments in the latter field in the last twenty years. It also reflects on the sociology of our discipline and makes suggestions for future research agendas.","[{""name"": ""Caoimhe Nic Dháibhéid"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shahmima Akhtar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dónal Hassett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kevin Kenny"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura McAtackney"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ian McBride"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Timothy G.

We do so by paying particular attention to discussions on contemporary perspectives and manifestations of Pan-Slavism that in our view have been largely missing from academic research. We begin the article by introducing a theoretical conceptualization of Pan-Slavism in general, preparing the ground for our inspection of the academic output in the said period. We then continue by presenting our own contribution to the conceptualization and the current state of the field on Pan-Slavism, suggesting venues that future research may take towards broadening the field that has been and remains narrow. We conclude the article by summarizing the key points made therein.","[{""name"": ""Vladimir Đorđević"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mikhail Suslov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marek Čejka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ondřej Mocek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Hrabálek"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.56021/9780801890734"", ""10.1163/9789004408005"", ""10.18848/2327-0071/CGP/v12i03/1-17"", ""10.30965/22102396-05502005"", ""10.18502/kss.v3i7.2485"", ""10.37708/bf.swu.v29i3.13"", ""10.2307/j.ctv18sqzjb"", ""10.1080/00905992.2012.743514"", ""10.4324/9781003131588"", ""10.1016/S0962-6298(02)00008-2"", ""10.1080/00263206.2016.1243532"", ""10.1080/13537113.2020.1754554"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511780141.009"", ""10.1080/01419870.2010.501111"", ""10.17223/18572685/54/19"", ""10.1080/714000224"", ""10.2307/1952279"", ""10.2747/1539-7216.53.5.575"", ""10.1017/nps.2019.117"", ""10.5699/slaveasteurorev2.98.3.0531"", ""10.1002/9781444315639.ch13"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199585977.001.0001"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2011.624762"", ""10.1080/13569310500395834"", ""10.1080/00905992.2016.1212824"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139683449.005"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2008.00329.x"", ""10.2307/1844302"", ""10.2747/1539-7216.53.5.557""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

It shows that at least three distinctive groups were dispersed during the wartime years and needed to be resettled after the war ended in August 1945: civilian refugees, administrators who had been relocated to the temporary capital at Chongqing, and troops transferred in anticipation of an upcoming civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists. The article argues that China's new sovereign status in 1945 was paradoxically a source of weakness when it came to resettlement and reconstruction, as China sought international funds to undertake its own reconstruction, but could not demit responsibility to an external actor to organise matters as the United States did for western Europe. A growing sense of anomie and unsettlement prevented resettlement and China remained a zone in which international and domestic conflict came together. Both sets of factors shaped the dislocation that destroyed the possibilities of a stable resettlement in China after the great displacement of wartime.","[{""name"": ""Rana Mitter"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/03086534.2018.1452542"", ""10.1093/pastj/gts033"", ""10.1093/pastj/gts035"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199674169.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0026749X1100014X"", ""10.1017/S0010417518000531""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

For formal verification using reachability analysis, this is an attractive conversion, as highly scalable methods exist to compute reachable sets for linear systems. However, two main challenges are present with this approach, both of which are addressed in this work. First, the approximation must be sufficiently accurate for the result to be meaningful, which is controlled by the choice ofobservable functionsduring Koopman operator linearization. By using random Fourier features as observable functions, the process becomes more systematic than earlier work, while providing a higher-accuracy approximation. Second, although the higher-dimensional system is linear, simple convex initial sets in the original space can become complex non-convex initial sets in the linear system. We overcome this using a combination of Taylor model arithmetic and polynomial zonotope refinement. Compared with prior work, the result is more efficient, more systematic and more accurate.","[{""name"": ""Stanley Bak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sergiy Bogomolov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Brandon Hencey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Niklas Kochdumper"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ethan Lew"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kostiantyn Potomkin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/2461328.2461358"", ""10.1109/TAC.2019.2906432"", ""10.1137/1.9781611976847.1"", ""10.1145/3302504.3311792"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2021.08.507"", ""10.1145/3178126.3178128"", ""10.1007/BF02546499"", ""10.1109/RTSS.2012.70"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_18"", ""10.1137/17M115414X"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-89716-1_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-31954-2_19"", ""10.1109/CDC42340.2020.9304238"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-0249-6_2"", ""10.1016/j.patcog.2004.09.006"", ""10.1002/3527603603"", ""10.1109/TAC.2020.3024348"", ""10.1145/3365365.3382192"", ""10.1073/pnas.17.5.315"", ""10.1007/3-540-46430-1_19"", ""10.1073/pnas.2026805118"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-35713-9"", ""10.1109/TAC.2005.851439"", ""10.1146/annurev-control-071020-010108"", ""10.1016/0020-7462(80)90024-4"", ""10.3182/20090819-3-PL-3002.00079"", ""10.1016/0375-9601(76)90101-8"", ""10.1145/1967701.1967723"", ""10.1016/j.nahs.2015.08.006"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4175.001.0001"", ""10.1590/S0101-82052007000100002"", ""10.1109/TIP.2006.888330"", ""10.1109/TGRS.2010.2049496"", ""10.1109/CDC42340.2020.9304431"", ""10.1007/s00332-015-9258-5"", ""10.3934/jcd.2015005"", ""10.23919/ACC.2019.8815339""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

To that end, it reexamines the role that the Chicago school of economics played in developing and propounding a distinct vision of Adam Smith, not only within the profession of economics, but also for the broader American public in the twentieth century. I argue that the readings, teachings, and interpretations of Smith from Chicago economists across different generations are more than just superficial symbolism, claims of intellectual authority, or rhetorical window dressing. Chicago’s engagement with Smith’s ideas constitute important interpretive and substantive arguments about the essence of Smith’s contribution to economics and the role that Smith’s ideas could play in shaping public policy.","[{""name"": ""GLORY M.

10.1017/S0068113X20000124,BRITANNIA,0603 World History; 0601 Archaeology,Polychromy on the Antonine Wall Distance Sculptures: Non-destructive Identification of Pigments on Roman Reliefs,"ABSTRACTNon-destructive analytical techniques are now widely and successfully employed in the fields of materials science and conservation. Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) and portable Raman spectrometry have proven particularly valuable for the rapidin-situanalysis of samples, but their applicability for the analysis of archaeological artefacts for which survival of surface treatments can be negatively impacted by post-depositional processes has been underexplored. Roman relief-sculpted monumental inscriptions from the Antonine Wall, commonly referred to as ‘Distance Slabs’, have offered an excellent opportunity to deploy these non-destructive techniques to determine whether they were originally adorned with pigments and, if so, to identify the colours used. This is a revolutionary approach to identifying colours on ancient sandstone sculpture that transforms our understanding of these unique monuments. Elemental composition analysis by pXRF has confirmed evidence for pigments and this is supported by the Raman results, making it possible to develop and reconstruct a palette of colours that originally brought these monuments to life in vibrant polychrome. The research offers a new methodology for identifying pigments on sandstone sculpture and opens new avenues for investigating other classes of material culture alongside the development of bespoke analytical equipment.","[{""name"": ""Louisa Campbell"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1475-4754.1998.tb00846.x"", ""10.1016/j.microc.2014.08.016"", ""10.1007/s12665-015-5066-3"", ""10.1016/j.sab.2005.10.006"", ""10.2307/3184636"", ""10.1016/S1386-1425(03)00069-6"", ""10.3764/aja.117.3.0383"", ""10.1306/070102730047"", ""10.9750/PSAS.105.176.182"", ""10.1016/j.jas.2011.05.021"", ""10.1108/02602280710731678"", ""10.1002/9780470996577.ch26"", ""10.1016/j.saa.2015.06.091"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2014.05.011"", ""10.1016/j.microc.2016.09.003"", ""10.3764/aja.122.3.0411"", ""10.2307/4238633"", ""10.1017/S1380203807002127"", ""10.4135/9781848607972.n28"", ""10.9750/9781908332240"", ""10.2307/jj.15136023.14"", ""10.1215/9780822386711"", ""10.9750/PSAS.111.519.521"", ""10.1145/1503454.1503456"", ""10.1039/C8AY00016F"", ""10.1002/9781118886205.ch2"", ""10.1007/s00216-005-3072-0"", ""10.2307/526768"", ""10.1002/9781118241912"", ""10.1002/jrs.4914"", ""10.1016/j.molstruc.2007.01.031"", ""10.4324/9780080943596"", ""10.1017/S0075435800057415"", ""10.1002/jrs.2701"", ""10.1002/9781118318140.wbra0085"", ""10.14795/j.v7i2.513"", ""10.1017/S0068245400020712"", ""10.2307/294470"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195336467.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1047759400074201""]","['Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Archeology', 'Conservation', 'Earth-Surface Processes']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('0709 地质学', 0.7376), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7361)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X19000414,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,"POLITICS IN SCHOOLGIRL DEBATING CULTURES IN ENGLAND, 1886-1914","ABSTRACTDebating was an important part of schoolgirls’ political education in late Victorian and Edwardian England that has been overlooked in the scholarship on female education and civics instruction. Debates offered middle- and working-class schoolgirls an embodied and interactive education for citizenship. Considering both the content of discussions and the process of debating, this article argues that school debates provided a unique opportunity for girls to discuss political ideas and develop political skills. Debates became intertwined with girls’ peer cultures, challenging contemporary and historiographical assumptions of girlhood apoliticism. Positioning girls as political subjects sheds new light on political change in modern Britain. Schoolgirl debates show how gendered political boundaries were shifting in this period. Within the unique space of the school debating chamber, girls were free to appropriate and subvert ‘masculine’ political subjects and ways of speaking. In mock parliaments, schoolgirls re-created the archetypal male political space of the House of Commons, demonstrating their familiarity with parliamentary politics. Schoolgirl debates therefore foreshadowed initiatives that promoted women's citizenship after partial suffrage was achieved in 1918, and they help to explain how the first women voters were assimilated easily into existing party and constitutional politics.","[{""name"": ""HELEN SUNDERLAND"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1750-0206.1993.tb00203.x"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtm051"", ""10.1093/ehr/ceu078"", ""10.1017/S0018246X10000518"", ""10.1177/0907568200007003001"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-21850-9"", ""10.1086/654913"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521257909.004"", ""10.1080/09612020903282068"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495700"", ""10.1093/tcbh/6.2.123"", ""10.1057/9780230375376"", ""10.5040/9780755622061"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719065309.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203383612"", ""10.1080/09612025.2015.1114328"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511896330"", ""10.1080/0046760790080101"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199582563.001.0001"", ""10.1080/0046760X.2010.514299"", ""10.1057/9781137333001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490545"", ""10.5871/bacad/9780197264492.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0018246X0500511X"", ""10.1093/tcbh/5.2.129"", ""10.1215/01636545-2800004"", ""10.1080/0046760X.2011.620015"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511560880"", ""10.3138/9781442674998""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Six kinds of relationships between nationalism and religion are critically reviewed: nationalism as a modern religion in competition with traditional religions; religious origins of the “Chosen People” as the mythomoteur of nationalism; religious exclusion as nation-building; religious influences on national policies; influence of religious observance on national identification; and religiously based “civilizations” transcending nationalisms. Western Christian experience with nationalism is not generalizable due to the institutional autonomy and supranational organization of the Catholic Church. Western European nationalisms were premised on religious sectarian homogeneity, and the homogenous “confessional state” served as the template of European nation-states. Furthermore, I argue that the late medieval eradication of Muslims and Jews across Western Europe prefigured sectarian and ethnonational purges of the following centuries. Finally, I argue that different configurations of religion and nationalism depend on two critical conditions: the degree to which the dominant religious tradition is doctrinally supraethnic and institutionally transnational, and the religious identity of the main adversary in the constitutive conflict that culminated in national statehood. The crises of Marxism and liberalism provide the context for the resurgence of religion and nationalism at present.","[{""name"": ""Şener Aktürk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/ssqu.12191"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-081715-074412"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12188"", ""10.1017/nps.2019.41"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01455.x"", ""10.1177/0305829809347538"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.1525/9780520925991"", ""10.2307/20045621"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511810480"", ""10.2307/3712269"", ""10.1515/9781400828555"", ""10.4324/9781315125084"", ""10.1017/S153759271700010X"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674074163"", ""10.1111/nana.12131"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511779510"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511779510.009"", ""10.1111/1469-8219.00073"", ""10.1111/j.1354-5078.1999.00331.x"", ""10.1080/00263200903294229"", ""10.1515/9780804779265"", ""10.1177/0011392103051003007"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000096"", ""10.3998/mpub.155507"", ""10.1093/ahr/rhz252"", ""10.1017/S0043887115000301"", ""10.1353/wp.0.0007"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00342"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674330177"", ""10.1017/9781316995280"", ""10.1177/0010414010370437"", ""10.1080/01402380412331300227"", ""10.1017/nps.2019.91"", ""10.5129/001041518823565597"", ""10.1080/14690760500099788"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00486.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5cgb1w"", ""10.1111/nana.12499"", ""10.1086/210435"", ""10.1017/nps.2019.125"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139170055"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139108898"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071312-145641"", ""10.1162/qjec.2009.124.3.1133"", ""10.1080/09612020000200246"", ""10.1177/1468796803003002003"", ""10.1080/14690760601121614"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-041719-101841"", ""10.1080/01419870.1992.9993756"", ""10.1017/9781108123716"", ""10.1017/S0003975600003908"", ""10.4159/9780674088962"", ""10.1353/kri.2007.0040"", ""10.1017/nps.2018.11"", ""10.1080/01419870.2020.1749688"", ""10.1017/S1537592706060439"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226663999.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400866458"", ""10.4159/9780674039308"", ""10.1007/s11186-007-9055-8"", ""10.1017/nps.2020.73"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511612107""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Some of the “classic” studies of nationalism have placed the media at the heart of their work but say very little about media theory or research. More recently, studies of populism and nationalist parties have talked quite a lot about the impact of digital technologies but have very little to say about nationalism. This piece first provides a brief overview of some of these classic studies before noting how insights from the study of media, and in particular audiences, began to filter through to nationalism research in the 1990s and early 2000s. It then addresses both the discursive and digital turns that influenced wider debates around the relationship between media and nationalism over the past decade or so, before outlining the limitations of such work and possible avenues for future research.","[{""name"": ""Michael Skey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1750481318771448"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.01.075"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190876791.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0163443716664482"", ""10.1111/nana.12685"", ""10.1080/00913367.2004.10639169"", ""10.1177/1527476412458163"", ""10.2202/1944-2866.1075"", ""10.1177/1750481308098764"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226062785.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14680777.2018.1465443"", ""10.1177/1367549407084963"", ""10.1353/sais.2006.0044"", ""10.1177/1527476404270608"", ""10.1057/9780230353893"", ""10.1080/14680777.2015.988393"", ""10.1080/14649370500463802"", ""10.1057/9780230251175_4"", ""10.1177/0038038520931997"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1999.tb02795.x"", ""10.1111/comt.12028"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479895120.001.0001"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7_4"", ""10.1177/0267323114533050"", ""10.1177/1367877919887757"", ""10.1080/13600826.2013.827632"", ""10.1080/0810902032000051027"", ""10.4324/9780203443729"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-34529-4"", ""10.4324/9780203768976"", ""10.4135/9781452204147"", ""10.1111/comt.12001"", ""10.4159/9780674030305"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00373.x"", ""10.4135/9781446221198"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00397.x"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7"", ""10.1177/1367549410391926"", ""10.1111/j.1754-9469.2006.tb00154.x"", ""10.1177/1461444899001001015"", ""10.1177/14614440022225689"", ""10.1111/nana.12684"", ""10.1177/0163443706062913"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199286744.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-38238-4"", ""10.1177/136754940000300305"", ""10.1177/0163443704042261"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.7.012003.104804"", ""10.1080/19409419.2010.10756772"", ""10.1080/14616700600890356"", ""10.4324/9780203150535"", ""10.1177/0163443707076190"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7_16"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199286744.003.0013"", ""10.4324/9780203022566"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1g69z35"", ""10.1177/1748048509104977"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1111/j.1754-9469.2011.01105.x"", ""10.1080/17447143.2011.652781"", ""10.1177/1461444812455148"", ""10.1177/1527476409358087"", ""10.4324/9780203380642"", ""10.1177/1363460715583604""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

While some scholars describe Transnistria’s nation-building strategy as a civic, multicultural project, the analysis of recent demographic and educational data corroborated with the close examination of local media content and official discourses—all point to the emergence of a distinct political culture marked by the increasing use of the Russian language in the public sphere, and the politicization of the Moldovan identity. Discourses about ethnic and national identity in the region have evolved as the Transnistrian elites reimagine the political community as part of theRusskii Mir.These circumstances suggest that, in the long run, the breakaway region might function as the southeastern frontline of Russian irredentism with the elites of the Pridnestrovska͡ia Moldavska͡ia Respublika continuing to call on the Russian Federation to annex the parastate instead of seeking a peaceful reintegration into Moldova.","[{""name"": ""Ion Marandici"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3167/fpcs.2008.260102"", ""10.1017/nps.2019.59"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2005.09.003"", ""10.1177/0022343306068102"", ""10.7591/9781501734137"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199893157.001.0001"", ""10.1017/nps.2018.26"", ""10.1353/imp.2006.0096"", ""10.2747/1060-586X.24.3.257"", ""10.4324/9780203834510"", ""10.1177/0888325407307351"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558764"", ""10.1162/isec.21.2.108"", ""10.1177/0888325413484174"", ""10.1086/657999"", ""10.56021/9780801890734"", ""10.2747/1060-586X.27.2.178"", ""10.1080/00905992.2015.1082996"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195305463.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00905990801934371"", ""10.1080/15387216.2017.1295275"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2015.1023004"", ""10.1353/wp.2001.0017"", ""10.1353/kri.2003.0027"", ""10.2307/3096847"", ""10.1162/002081800551398""]","['Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Indeed, substructurality is finally taking hold in modern programming; Haskell now has linear types roughly based on Girard’s linear logic but integrated via graded function arrows, Clean has uniqueness types designed to ensure that values have at most a single reference to them, and Rust has an intricate ownership system for guaranteeing memory safety. But despite this broad range of resourceful type systems, there is comparatively little understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses or whether their underlying frameworks can be unified. There is often confusion about whether linearity and uniqueness are essentially the same, or are instead ‘dual’ to one another, or somewhere in between. This paper formalises the relationship between these two well-studied but rarely contrasted ideas, building on two distinct bodies of literature, showing that it is possible and advantageous to have both linear and unique types in the same type system. We study the guarantees of the resulting system and provide a practical implementation in the graded modal setting of the Granule language, adding a third kind of modality alongside coeffect and effect modalities. We then demonstrate via a benchmark that our implementation benefits from expected efficiency gains enabled by adding uniqueness to a language that already has a linear basis.","[{""name"": ""Danielle Marshall"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Vollmer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dominic Orchard"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4230/LIPIcs.TYPES.2014.1"", ""10.1145/582419.582448"", ""10.2168/lmcs-11(1:3)2015"", ""10.1145/142137.142162"", ""10.1007/3-540-57529-4_42"", ""10.1007/BFb0022251"", ""10.1145/3158093"", ""10.1007/3-540-44898-5_4"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2021.9"", ""10.1145/3434331"", ""10.1145/3408993"", ""10.1145/1291151.1291199"", ""10.1007/11693024_2"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(87)90045-4"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(92)90386-T"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2020.10"", ""10.1109/LICS.1990.113759"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14107-2_17"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2005.11.006"", ""10.1145/1029873.1029883"", ""10.1145/99583.99623"", ""10.1145/3158154"", ""10.1145/1863543.1863582"", ""10.1145/73560.73564"", ""10.1145/2500365.2500601"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5919193"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5919209"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-30936-1_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72019-3_17"", ""10.1145/2951913.2951925"", ""10.1007/11417170_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36946-9_4"", ""10.1017/S095679682100023X"", ""10.1145/3341714"", ""10.1145/3122955.3122965"", ""10.1145/3443420"", ""10.1145/2500365.2500598"", ""10.1145/3408985"", ""10.1145/3453483.3454036"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139193313.005"", ""10.1007/3-540-57787-4_23"", ""10.1016/S0743-1066(96)00068-4"", ""10.1109/LICS.2001.932498"", ""10.1023/B:LISP.0000029446.78563.a4"", ""10.1145/1926385.1926436"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-40355-2_13"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.22.3"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-74130-5_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-85373-2_12"", ""10.1145/115865.115894"", ""10.1007/3-540-58027-1_24"", ""10.1007/3-540-57182-5_12"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1104.003.0003"", ""10.1145/363911.363923"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-30557-6_8""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

In this view, little political importance is attached to indigenous political organisation, with desert nomads being considered an amorphous mass of unsettled people beyond the frontiers of established states. However, in the Eastern Desert of Sudan and Egypt, a pastoralist nomadic people ancestrally related to the modern Beja dominated the deserts for millennia. Though generally considered as a group of politically divided tribes sharing only language and a pastoralist economy, ancient Beja society and its elites created complex political arrangements in their desert. When Egyptian, Greek, Coptic, and Arab sources are combined and analysed, it is evident that nomads formed a large confederate ‘nomadic state’ throughout late antiquity and the early medieval period — a vital cog in the political engine of Northeast Africa.","[{""name"": ""Julien Cooper"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2458/azu_jaei_v07i2_howley"", ""10.1007/s10814-014-9073-9"", ""10.1524/zaes.1922.57.jg.51"", ""10.2307/1774054"", ""10.2458/azu_jaei_v05i4_manassa"", ""10.1111/hith.10658"", ""10.1007/BF00975123"", ""10.1017/S0021853797007172"", ""10.1177/030751337506100127"", ""10.2143/RE.60.0.2049279""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Archeology', 'Anthropology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The main aim is to show that what we can call a “global history of the Civil War” emerges from his pen: a history that is global not simply in a geographical sense, that is, because it expands the European space beyond the Atlantic and towards the Pacific, but also because of the general meaning it takes on in the history of capitalism. The essay highlights how the Civil War opened the Marxian issue of emancipation, his vision of class struggle and his view of the working class, to the presence of a black proletariat that interacted with the struggle of the white working classes, the latter of which until then had been the main focus of his work. It also highlights how the different and disarticulated voices of labor – slave and free, black and white – on both sides of the Atlantic effected a revolutionary shift in the Civil War: interjecting a “revolutionary turn” into what we can call the “long constitutional history” of the political conflict between North and South that changed the economic and social shape of the nation. More importantly, the essay reconstructs what can be termed the “state moment,” which was entangled with the “long constitutional history” and the “revolutionary turn” of the Civil War. As the transnational calls for emancipation from slavery and wage labor impacted the transnational processes of accumulation of industrial capital, the American state became a player in the world market: its financial and fiscal policies became socially linked to the government of industrial capital. In this sense, as the essay underlines in the conclusion, the “global history of the Civil War” that Marx effectively drafted, outlined the theoretical and political hypothesis that formed the basis of his mature reflection in the pages of Capital: the “emancipation of labour” should be thought of as a global issue, “neither a local nor a national, but a social problem.”","[{""name"": ""Matteo Battistini"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1907981"", ""10.4159/9780674022096""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Public Administration']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

They should define the allowed sequential and relaxed-memory concurrency behaviour of programs, but hitherto there has been no integration of full-scale instruction-set architecture (ISA) semantics with axiomatic concurrency models, either in mathematics or in tools. These ISA semantics can be surprisingly large and intricate, e.g. 100k+ lines for Armv8-A. In this paper we present a tool, Isla, for computing the allowed behaviours of concurrent litmus tests with respect to full-scale ISA definitions, in Sail, and arbitrary axiomatic relaxed-memory concurrency models, in the Cat language. It is based on a generic symbolic engine for Sail ISA specifications, which should be valuable also for other verification tasks. We equip the tool with a web interface to make it widely accessible, and illustrate and evaluate it for Armv8-A and RISC-V. By using full-scale and authoritative ISA semantics, this lets one evaluate litmus tests using arbitrary user instructions with high confidence. Moreover, because these ISA specifications give detailed and validated definitions of the sequential aspects of systems functionality, as used by hypervisors and operating systems, e.g. instruction fetch, exceptions, and address translation, our tool provides a basis for developing concurrency semantics for these. We demonstrate this for the Armv8-A instruction-fetch model and self-modifying code examples of Simner et al.","[{""name"": ""Alasdair Armstrong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Brian Campbell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ben Simner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Pulte"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Sewell"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-19835-9_5"", ""10.1145/2627752"", ""10.1145/3290384"", ""10.1145/3062341.3062353"", ""10.1145/2830772.2830775"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31424-7_36"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-03359-9_27"", ""10.1109/12.752664"", ""10.1145/3158107"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314624"", ""10.1109/FMCAD.2016.7886675"", ""10.1145/1993498.1993520"", ""10.1145/1594834.1480929"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-44914-8_23"", ""10.1109/MM.2018.032271062"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009838"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-39724-3_9"", ""10.1109/IPDPS.2004.1302944"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8603015""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

While campaigning for Muslim internationalism, the Young Turk leaders were able to partake in international politics, but ironically reduced their own legitimacy and capacity as non-state actors by championing revolutionary bilateralism between Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Soviet Russia.","[{""name"": ""Alp Yenen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/9781108182072"", ""10.1093/ahr/rhy571"", ""10.5040/9780755625536"", ""10.4159/9780674977402"", ""10.1177/002200947000500203"", ""10.1163/9789004491748_008"", ""10.1057/jird.2014.20"", ""10.1080/00263209908701286"", ""10.1017/S0020743800027409"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00007848"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-23658-9_5"", ""10.1017/S0026749X15000244"", ""10.1515/9781400823260"", ""10.1057/9780230309036"", ""10.3406/cmr.1980.1384"", ""10.1093/0198275285.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199899142.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139506366"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139108584"", ""10.1515/9780773562851-021"", ""10.3406/cmr.1975.1234"", ""10.1215/1089201X-2322498"", ""10.2307/2621845"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7709.2007.00641.x"", ""10.1080/09668135108409832"", ""10.1080/00263206.2019.1590820"", ""10.1353/kri.2021.0001"", ""10.1080/09592290590948388"", ""10.7312/aydi13778"", ""10.1515/9781400838172-010"", ""10.4324/9780203036594"", ""10.14712/23363231.2019.15"", ""10.1017/S0260210500116213"", ""10.2307/j.ctvt6rn2c.7"", ""10.1017/S0960777316000035"", ""10.1162/00208180151140577"", ""10.1177/002200949703200207"", ""10.1007/s11186-015-9251-x"", ""10.4324/9780203480274"", ""10.7788/boehlau.9783412215071"", ""10.1080/03068378208730084"", ""10.1080/00263209308700945"", ""10.4159/9780674982147"", ""10.1353/kri.2011.0028"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139681001"", ""10.1163/9789004621732"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-27702-5"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316105900"", ""10.1525/9780520915671-006"", ""10.1017/S0960777305002705"", ""10.1080/07075332.1980.9640214"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491474"", ""10.1080/00210862.2016.1217636"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139696890""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

We tackle scalability issues that arise due to the large search space of quantified invariants by combining a breadth-first search strategy and a new syntactic form for quantifier-free bodies. The breadth-first strategy prevents inductive generalization from getting stuck in regions of the search space that are expensive to search and focuses instead on lemmas that are easy to discover. The new syntactic form is well-suited to lemmas with quantifier alternations by allowing both limited conjunction and disjunction in the quantifier-free body, while carefully controlling the size of the search space. Combining the breadth-first strategy with the new syntactic form results in useful inductive bias by prioritizing lemmas according to: (i) well-defined syntactic metrics for simple quantifier structures and quantifier-free bodies, and (ii) the empirically useful heuristic of preferring lemmas that are fast to discover. On a benchmark suite of primarily distributed protocols and complex Paxos variants, we demonstrate that our algorithm can solve more of the most complicated examples than state-of-the-art techniques.","[{""name"": ""Jason R.

The starting point is a program sketch representing a finite family of finite-state Markov chains with related but distinct topologies, and a reachability specification. The method builds on a novel inductive oracle that greedily generates counter-examples (CEs) for violating programs and uses them to prune the family. These CEs leverage the semantics of the family in the form of bounds on its best- and worst-case behaviour provided by a deductive oracle using an MDP abstraction. The method further monitors the performance of the synthesis and adaptively switches between inductive and deductive reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that the novel CE construction provides a significantly faster and more effective pruning strategy leading to an accelerated synthesis process on a wide range of benchmarks. For challenging problems, such as the synthesis of decentralized partially-observable controllers, we reduce the run-time from a day to minutes.","[{""name"": ""Roman Andriushchenko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Milan Češka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Junges"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joost-Pieter Katoen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-07317-0_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_28"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2019.104504"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-19835-9_30"", ""10.1145/2914770.2837666"", ""10.1016/j.jss.2018.05.013"", ""10.1007/s00236-016-0265-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30942-8_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17465-1_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30806-3_7"", ""10.1007/s00165-017-0432-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-31862-0_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11936-6_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_18"", ""10.1145/2379776.2379787"", ""10.1145/1806799.1806833"", ""10.1007/s00165-012-0227-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_47"", ""10.1145/288197.581195"", ""10.1145/1712605.1712624"", ""10.1145/2813885.2737982"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-28929-8"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_21"", ""10.1002/9780470316887"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46520-3_4"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-19249-9_27"", ""10.1145/3290350"", ""10.1145/1064978.1065045"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95582-7_19"", ""10.2168/LMCS-11(1:15)2015""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

This article explores what role conspiratorial narratives have played in the development of different “imagined communities” in the premodern, modern, and contemporary worlds. I argue that premodern conspiratorial narratives were mostly focused on eschatological and theological images, aiming to blame and delegitimise the religious Other. In these imaginary plots, spread of disease was interpreted as an attack on one’s religious beliefs. The prevalence of religious conspiracies helped reinforce religiously based, yet temporary, “imagined communities.” With the rise of nation-states and the decline of empires and patrimonial kingdoms, the periodic outbursts of epidemics gradually attained more nationalist interpretations. Hence in the modern era, pandemics often triggered the growth of nationalist conspiracies. In these narratives the threatening Other was usually nationalised, and even traditional religious groups became reinterpreted as a threat to one’s national security. In recent times, new technologies and modes of communication have created space for the emergence of global conspiracy theories. The onset of Covid-19 has been associated with the dramatic expansion of such conspiracies. Some scholars have interpreted this as a reliable sign that nation-states and nationalisms have lost their dominance. However, this article shows that many global conspiracies in fact reinforce nationalist ideas and practices and, in this process, foster the perpetuation of national imagined communities.","[{""name"": ""Siniša Malešević"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/s41599-017-0014-3"", ""10.1017/9781316155332"", ""10.1111/nana.12410"", ""10.1017/9781108589451"", ""10.1016/j.jmedhist.2010.06.001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199228232.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03071022.2017.1290365"", ""10.1177/0725513617700017"", ""10.1163/9789004474321"", ""10.4135/9781446214855"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511570896"", ""10.4324/9780203833971"", ""10.1111/geoj.12116"", ""10.1057/9780230349216"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtm005"", ""10.1080/000713100358444"", ""10.1057/9780230625648""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X21000765,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,Globalizing the History of the First World War: Economic Approaches,"AbstractThis historiographical review offers an overview of new approaches to the global history of the First World War. It first considers how, over the last decade, there has been a move to emphasize the war's imperial dimensions: in reconsiderations of the war in Africa, the experience of soldiers and workers from across Europe's colonial empires, and the German ‘global strategy’ of fomenting unrest within the Allied empires. It then suggests that new global histories of the First World War give further attention to its economic aspects, particularly in two ways: first, by recovering understudied global financial aspects of the war, including the effects of the 1914 financial crisis and wartime inflation on economies and societies far outside of Europe; and second, by investigating wartime histories of primary production, both in colonial territories and sovereign states in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. It argues that these approaches can offer an important corrective to common assumptions that the First World War led to a dramatic break with pre-war globalizing trends.","[{""name"": ""Jamie Martin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0022009414552868"", ""10.1111/sena.12090"", ""10.1017/S0018246X18000109"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2011.00129.x"", ""10.1080/19475020.2016.1174591"", ""10.2307/3985766"", ""10.1017/S2398568217000036"", ""10.3167/hrrh.2016.420307"", ""10.1017/S0067237821000047"", ""10.3366/brw.2020.0347"", ""10.13109/gege.2014.40.2.160"", ""10.1080/19475021003621036"", ""10.1086/694391"", ""10.1515/ngs-2018-0024"", ""10.13109/gege.2014.40.2.214"", ""10.1080/03057078908708210"", ""10.1017/S0022278X00056949"", ""10.1017/S0026749X1300036X"", ""10.1177/0022009412472713"", ""10.1017/S0021853700029212""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Through this, a BDD-based Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver can generate a checkable proof of unsatisfiability. Such proofs indicate that the formula is truly unsatisfiable without requiring the user to trust the BDD package or the SAT solver built on top of it.We extend their work to enable arbitrary existential quantification of the formula variables, a critical capability for BDD-based SAT solvers.

Thesinarquistasshared many of the features of fascism and Nazism, the major global antidemocratic movements of the time, including a strident nationalism, authoritarian leanings, an emphasis on martial discipline and strict organizational structure, and a militant aesthetic. Both its ideological leanings and rapid growth (as many as 500,000 members by the early 1940s) led many US writers to suggest that the UNS represented a dangerous fifth-column threat to both Mexico and the United States. Others, particularly in the Catholic press, saw the UNS as an anticommunist organization that could actually help foster democracy in Mexico. For their part, UNS leaders defended themselves vociferously and sought to build relationships with influential US Catholics who could advocate for them in the press. By analyzing this debate, this paper both underscores the transnational characteristics of the UNS and highlights the crucial role of US public opinion in Mexican politics during the 1940s.","[{""name"": ""Julia G.

10.1017/S0018246X19000712,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,"FEDERATION, PARTNERSHIP, AND THE CHRONOLOGIES OF SPACE IN 1950s EAST AND CENTRAL AFRICA","AbstractThis article assesses the relationship between the imposed Central African Federation (1953–63) and the ways in which East and Central African thinkers and leaders conveyed and pursued the possibilities of decolonization. Existing literature on federalism in twentieth-century Africa fails to place regional projects in dialogue, studying in isolation East Africa and Central Africa, ‘utopian’ and oppressive regionalisms. But such clear dividing lines were not articulated in the four discursive ‘sketches’ of East and Central Africa that this article brings to light: those of anti-Federation organizations in Nairobi and Ndola in 1952; students at Makerere College (Kampala) in 1953; mobile Malawian activists in regional and pan-African forums around 1955–8; and East African party publicity representatives around 1958–60. At each of these critical moments, thinkers creatively constructed various relationships between geographical space and chronological change, through the lens of a broader, interdependent East and Central Africa, as a means to fend off perceived threats to a precarious advancement towards a democratic future. Attending to the evolution of these ideas shows not only how the Central African Federation placed material constraints on regional solidarity, but how ‘thinking regionally’ could support the case for national borders, even before decolonization.","[{""name"": ""ISMAY MILFORD"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/03057070.2019.1558654"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198204237.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350989108"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139870573"", ""10.1017/S0010417518000191"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199899142.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822375791"", ""10.1080/00020184.2013.812880"", ""10.1080/03057070120116971"", ""10.1353/jwh.2019.0016"", ""10.1017/S0018246X18000407"", ""10.1215/1089201x-4133001"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a007949"", ""10.1080/00358535408451911"", ""10.1093/ahr/rhy577"", ""10.1080/09592296.2013.762881"", ""10.1525/9780520922297"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198844044.001.0001"", ""10.2307/220093"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674421394"", ""10.1080/03086534.2017.1379670""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Existing work on AARA has focused on bounds that are polynomial in the sizes of the inputs. This paper presents and extension of AARA to exponential bounds that preserves the benefits of the technique, such as compositionality and efficient type inference based on linear constraint solving. A key idea is the use of the Stirling numbers of the second kind as the basis of potential functions, which play the same role as the binomial coefficients in polynomial AARA. To formalize the similarities with the existing analyses, the paper presents a general methodology for AARA that is instantiated to the polynomial version, the exponential version, and a combined system with potential functions that are formed by products of Stirling numbers and binomial coefficients. The soundness of exponential AARA is proved with respect to an operational cost semantics and the analysis of representative example programs demonstrates the effectiveness of the new analysis.","[{""name"": ""David M.

Yet the study of Europeanism has not as yet systematically examined the range of conceptual meanings that the various strands of the Europeanist ideological family exhibit. Instead, Europeanism has typically been treated either ahistorically as a set of desirable social ideals and values, or reductively as a quality exclusively associated with European institutions in their current form. Both obscure the fundamental, wide-ranging debates over the nature of ‘Europe’ and ‘Europeanness’ that have shaped the substantive development of Europeanist ideologies over the last century. This article maps out the key areas of conceptual contestation that are consistently shared by all Europeanisms regarding the boundaries of Europe, the degree of European consolidation, and how ‘Europeanisation’ is to be realised.","[{""name"": ""Marius S.

The first to translate Tagore into Arabic after a visit to his Santiniketan in 1916, Bustani spent his life annotating and translating into Arabic the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and Kalidasa's Shakuntala . Alongside his self-professed and self-funded philological project, Bustani was one of the most important poets and lawyers in British Mandate Palestine, inspiring protest with his verse and litigating against colonial land policies. By focusing on Bustani's relation to British imperial culture, his political commitments in Palestine, and the contours of his indological project, this article uncovers a new history of global philology and an enabling colonial frame, long hidden in the many narrations of orientalism's travel and Palestine's colonization.","[{""name"": ""Esmat Elhalaby"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/1089201X-2826133"", ""10.4159/9780674977402"", ""10.1017/S1479244310000065"", ""10.1111/hith.10746"", ""10.1017/S0010417503000355"", ""10.1057/9781137011923"", ""10.4159/9780674972414"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199746682.001.0001"", ""10.1525/california/9780520262010.001.0001"", ""10.1163/15685209-12341449"", ""10.1057/9781403918413_2"", ""10.1057/9780230339514"", ""10.4159/9780674249868"", ""10.1080/00210860305244"", ""10.1086/374027"", ""10.1177/0021989412445422"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139012140"", ""10.4324/9780203939789""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1017/ssh.2020.13,SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY,0603 World History,Drafting the Dutch: Selection Biases in Dutch Conscript Records in the Second Half of the Nineteenth Century,"ABSTRACTConscription records are considered to be the best sources for studying heights over cohorts. This article discusses the various steps and selection mechanisms involved in the conscription system of the Netherlands, which was more or less similar to the systems found in other European countries. Starting with a birth cohort of 4,436 boys, we run a series of regressions on the likelihood to be registered at all and to have one’s height recorded. We discuss the effects of cohort attrition through mortality and migration, and explore familial, social, and religious reasons for evading registration and (medical) examination. We find various kinds of selections, but their effects on the distribution and averages of heights are limited. Thus, heights culled from conscripts records are indeed an excellent indicator of a cohort’s biological standard of living. However, researchers focusing on social variation in height need to be aware of the unequal opportunities to evade registration and measurement.","[{""name"": ""Björn Quanjer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Kok"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.hisfam.2004.01.002"", ""10.1016/j.ehb.2007.04.003"", ""10.18352/bmgn-lchr.3919"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2005.00305.x"", ""10.4054/DemRes.2010.23.4"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2016.1230510"", ""10.1080/00324728.2020.1718186"", ""10.1007/s12110-017-9303-1"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2261335"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-40501-3_57"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2017.1302890"", ""10.1016/S1081-602X(97)90027-0"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2010.05.003"", ""10.3386/w19955"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511975912"", ""10.3917/hes.091.0097"", ""10.1086/245016"", ""10.4000/eps.5631"", ""10.3109/03014460.2014.942366"", ""10.18352/tseg.629"", ""10.1515/9781400860388"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2016.1230509"", ""10.1016/j.ehb.2009.02.001"", ""10.1353/dem.0.0049"", ""10.1007/s12110-008-9029-1"", ""10.3917/adh.108.0019"", ""10.1080/20780389.2012.657489"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2016.1212722"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2016.1143856"", ""10.1016/j.ehb.2007.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.04.006"", ""10.1017/S0022050717000031""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It can be shockingly effective at finding bugs, but it often requires generating a very large number of inputs to do so. In this paper, we apply ideas from combinatorial testing, a powerful and widely studied testing methodology, to modify the distributions of our random generators so as to find bugs with fewer tests. The key concept is combinatorial coverage, which measures the degree to which a given set of tests exercises every possible choice of values for every small combination of input features.In its “classical” form, combinatorial coverage only applies to programs whose inputs have a very particular shape—essentially, a Cartesian product of finite sets. We generalize combinatorial coverage to the richer world of algebraic data types by formalizing a class of sparse test descriptions based on regular tree expressions. This new definition of coverage inspires a novel combinatorial thinning algorithm for improving the coverage of random test generators, requiring many fewer tests to catch bugs. We evaluate this algorithm on two case studies, a typed evaluator for System F terms and a Haskell compiler, showing significant improvements in both.","[{""name"": ""Harrison Goldstein"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""John Hughes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leonidas Lampropoulos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benjamin C.

This paper studies how internees’ careers were affected in the long run. Combining Census data, camp records, and survey data, I develop a predictor of a person’s internment status based on Census observables. Using a difference-in-differences framework, I find that internment had long-run positive effects on earnings. The evidence is consistent with mechanisms related to increased mobility due to re-optimization of occupation and location choices, possibly facilitated by camps’ high economic diversity.","[{""name"": ""Jaime Arellano-Bover"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1257/app.20160307"", ""10.1257/aer.20180044"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjf9x5x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-937X.2009.00536.x"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2015.02.001"", ""10.1080/01621459.2000.10473902"", ""10.1017/S0022050700088252"", ""10.1093/qje/qjy006"", ""10.1111/ecoj.12023"", ""10.1257/000282805774670446"", ""10.1086/430285"", ""10.1093/restud/rdab062"", ""10.3386/w18693"", ""10.3386/w27372"", ""10.1080/01621459.1992.10475212"", ""10.1257/aer.96.3.863"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2021.03.014"", ""10.1257/aer.20161352"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3361356"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691157825.001.0001"", ""10.3982/ECTA11427"", ""10.1086/675805"", ""10.1016/j.labeco.2019.02.007"", ""10.1257/aer.97.4.1467"", ""10.1093/ereh/hez013"", ""10.1017/S0022050719000536"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2798253"", ""10.1086/708445"", ""10.1162/00335530151144113"", ""10.1257/aer.20150572"", ""10.1257/aer.20181518"", ""10.2307/2951620""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0738248020000255,LAW AND HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0301 Law,"Discerning a Dignitary Offense: The Concept of Equal ""Public Rights"" during Reconstruction","The mountain of modern interpretation to which the language of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution has been subjected tends to overshadow the multiple concepts of antidiscrimination that were actually circulating at the time of its drafting. Moreover, as authors on race and law have pointed out, Congress itself lacked any African American representatives during the 1866–68 moment of transitional justice. The subsequent development of a “state action doctrine” limiting the reach of federal civil rights enforcement, in turn, eclipsed important contemporary understandings of the harms that Reconstruction-era initiatives sought to combat. In contrast to the oblique language of the Fourteenth Amendment, a dignity-based legal theory of affirmative equal rights had by 1867 taken center stage in the cosmopolitan city of New Orleans. Activists formulated the concept of “public rights” as a claim to participation without discrimination in the entire sphere of “common life.” Elections for delegates to Louisiana's Constitutional Convention of 1867–68, held under the broad suffrage mandated by the Military Reconstruction Acts, yielded a convention in which half of the members were men of African descent. Seeking the “impartial treatment of all men” in “[c]hurches, hotels, cars, steamboats, theaters, stores, even schools,” the convention crafted a Bill of Rights that affirmatively guaranteed to all of the state's citizens “the same civil, political, and public rights,” independent of race or color. These innovations in the defense of human rights under law drew from a deep well of anti-caste thinking developed in domestic and transnational discussions conducted in both French and English, with participants from both sides of the Atlantic and the Caribbean. Cosmopolitan progressives such as Edouard Tinchant and Jean-Charles Houzeau worked with Louisiana-born activists including Louis Charles Roudanez, Simeon Belden, and Paul Trévigne to develop and advance the idea of public rights. Legislators crafted and passed state statutes that provided for civil penalties for violation of these rights, along with a private cause of action that could yield both actual and exemplary damages. Throughout the 1870s, however, advocates met a fierce white-supremacist counterattack, one that fused obstructionist litigation, vote suppression, and vigilante violence. A claim to equal treatment under the 1868 constitution was won in the state courts by Josephine Decuir, but was overturned in 1877 at the United States Supreme Court. With the ascent of the Democratic Party, white supremacists–including the lawyer/vigilante Robert Hardin Marr-took their seats on the state Supreme Court. By 1879, the public rights guarantees had been expunged from the state's constitution. Nonetheless, for a crucial decade, the cross-racial politics of Louisiana had overcome many of the deficits of legitimacy that often undercut moments of transitional lawmaking. Delegates to the 1867–68 Constitutional Convention took the opportunity to spell out specific positive rights that they saw as essential to full civil freedom. And at the center, they placed their insistence that the state had an obligation to assure that men and women of color would not be subjected to forced indignity in the public sphere.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca J.

Our starting point is an open problem posed by Hongseok Yang: what class of statistical probabilistic programs have densities that are differentiable almost everywhere? To formalise the problem, we consider Statistical PCF (SPCF), an extension of call-by-value PCF with real numbers, and constructs for sampling and conditioning. We give SPCF a sampling-style operational semantics à la Borgström et al., and study the associated weight (commonly referred to as the density) function and value function on the set of possible execution traces.Our main result is that almost surely terminating SPCF programs, generated from a set of primitive functions (e.g. the set of analytic functions) satisfying mild closure properties, have weight and value functions that are almost everywhere differentiable. We use a stochastic form of symbolic execution to reason about almost everywhere differentiability. A by-product of this work is that almost surely terminatingdeterministic(S)PCF programs with real parameters denote functions that are almost everywhere differentiable.Our result is of practical interest, as almost everywhere differentiability of the density function is required to hold for the correctness of major gradient-based inference algorithms.","[{""name"": ""Carol Mak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C.-H.

The synthesis problem is specified by an input reference (recursive) function and a recursion skeleton. The goal is to synthesize a recursive function equivalent to the input function whose recursion strategy is specified by the recursion skeleton. In this context, we illustrate that it is possible to selectively bound a subset of the (recursively typed) parameters, each by a suitable bound. The choices are guided by counterexamples. The evaluation of our strategy on a broad set of benchmarks shows that it succeeds in efficiently synthesizing non-trivial recursive functions where standard across-the-board bounding would fail.","[{""name"": ""Azadeh Farzan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Victor Nicolet"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-89719-6_7"", ""10.1145/3183713.3196891"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_67"", ""10.1109/FMCAD.2013.6679385"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_14"", ""10.1145/321992.321996"", ""10.1145/3062341.3062355"", ""10.1145/3062341.3062382"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54577-5_5"", ""10.1145/2737924.2737977"", ""10.1145/2837614.2837629"", ""10.1145/2103746.2103753"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54577-5_14"", ""10.1145/2983990.2983993"", ""10.1145/2103746.2103758"", ""10.1145/2509136.2509555"", ""10.1145/1480881.1480933"", ""10.1145/1993316.1993525"", ""10.1145/1706299.1706355"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-12251-4_23"", ""10.1145/1480881.1480905"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1145/1926385.1926453"", ""10.1145/2737924.2738007"", ""10.1145/2908080.2908093"", ""10.1145/2535838.2535873"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21668-3_12"", ""10.1145/1250734.1250754"", ""10.1145/1375581.1375599"", ""10.1145/1168857.1168907"", ""10.1145/321992.322002"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30048-7_35""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

In little-studied archival papers, Rawls argued that the draft both exposed “background” structural racial injustice and constituted a burdening of black Americans that violated the norms of fair cooperation. Rather than obscuring racial injustice and focusing exclusively on economic inequality, as Charles Mills has claimed, Rawls rejected the ascendant conservative views that naturalized black poverty or else attributed it to cultural pathologies in black families. Thus Rawls found nothing illicit in taking the position of a disadvantaged racial group as a relevant comparison when applying his ideal theory to nonideal circumstances. However, I contend in this article that Rawls's account of political philosophy as an attempt to find a consensus may be similarly ideological, leading him to displace the reality of conflict through begging descriptions, expressivist formulations, and historical romanticism.","[{""name"": ""Brandon M.

In reality, these groups merged together through a diverse group of applied mathematics teachers, textbook writers, and instrument makers catering to a market ranging from navigators and surveyors to bookkeepers. Besides its direct economic contribution in diffusing useful numerical skills, this “practical mathematics” facilitated later industrialization in two ways. First, a large supply of instrument and watch makers provided Britain with a pool of versatile, mechanically skilled labor to build the increasingly complicated machinery of the late eighteenth century. Second, the less well-known but equally revolutionary innovations in machine tools—which, contrary to the Habbakuk thesis, occurred largely in Britain during the 1820s and 1830s to mass-produce interchangeable parts for iron textile machinery—drew on a technology of exact measurement developed for navigational and astronomical instruments.","[{""name"": ""Morgan Kelly"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cormac Ó Gráda"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/20020383"", ""10.1353/tech.2006.0179"", ""10.1353/ecs.2015.0006"", ""10.1086/218962"", ""10.1017/S0022050709000837"", ""10.1179/ldn.1994.19.1.36"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226764634.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007087400032945"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226411637.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511487750"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00591.x"", ""10.2307/2707279"", ""10.1177/007327530604400202"", ""10.1515/9781400829439"", ""10.1163/1573382054615433"", ""10.1177/007327530704500202"", ""10.1257/0002828054201305"", ""10.1017/S0022050700068388"", ""10.1017/S0022050720000595"", ""10.2307/3104900"", ""10.1080/01615449809601197"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-8431-8"", ""10.2307/2226046"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521572446.024"", ""10.1086/720890"", ""10.1017/S0020859000003588"", ""10.1177/002182868301400205"", ""10.2307/2594204"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226148847.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49430-2_2"", ""10.1257/jel.50.1.85"", ""10.1080/00076797500000018"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080213-041042"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226012650.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007680513000159"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1wf4dft"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00522.x"", ""10.1017/9781787442382"", ""10.3886/E170761V1"", ""10.1080/00033797900200101"", ""10.1177/007327538602400101"", ""10.1093/es/khn004"", ""10.1177/007327539903700202"", ""10.1080/00253359.1998.10656713"", ""10.1086/657268"", ""10.1525/9780520948167"", ""10.1080/00033798700200261"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-8645-7"", ""10.1017/S0007087499003568"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-3207-0"", ""10.1017/S0022050717000043"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511816680"", ""10.1093/qje/qjw026""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Mathematics']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Theoretical Computer Science', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7713), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7583)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

It focuses on the value, structure and destination of exports of domestic goods from Mompox to markets on the Atlantic and the Andes. By unearthing unexplored sources, this paper provides evidence that will help to understand, indirectly, some issues such as the nature and timing of economic growth, the degree of regional specialisation and, above all, the role of inland ports in the economic geography of the viceroyalty. The paper contends, first, that the region experienced a boom–bust cycle during the late colonial period. The export of domestic goods doubled between 1770 and 1800 but subsequently collapsed during the 1802-1809 years. Second, evidence suggests that the region experienced a process of market deepening and widening. Trade flows, then, played a larger role in shaping the economic history of the region than previously thought.","[{""name"": ""James V. Torres-Moreno"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""José L.

This disaster played a significant role in catalyzing wider debates about the impact of East India Company governance and the place of the subcontinent within the post-emancipation British Empire. By comparing the responses of organization such as the Aborigines Protection Society and British India Society to that of proponents of the newly emergent indenture system, the paper seeks to contextualize responses to the famine in terms both of longer histories of famine in South Asia and of the specific imperial circumstances of the late 1830s. In doing so, it explores how ideas of agricultural distress in India fed into competing strategies to utilize Indian labor in the service of colonial commodity production both within India and around the empire.","[{""name"": ""Andrea Major"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1525/9780520322356"", ""10.1086/385806"", ""10.1080/01440390802673856"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtx060"", ""10.1080/08905490512331329349"", ""10.1353/jem.2002.0017"", ""10.1080/02666030.2017.1300374"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtp016"", ""10.1017/S0018246X08007322"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801451089.001.0001"", ""10.1080/0144039X.2010.521338"", ""10.1080/0144039X.2016.1208908"", ""10.1525/9780520957572"", ""10.1177/001946466700400203"", ""10.1111/j.1478-0542.2004.00089.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495724"", ""10.1515/9781846157745"", ""10.2307/2716046"", ""10.1017/S0026749X0999031X"", ""10.1191/0309132504ph489oa"", ""10.2979/victorianstudies.54.2.227"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195093469.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1361491697000026"", ""10.1017/S0010417500018399"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226519180.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0041977X03000338"", ""10.1080/03086534.2012.730828"", ""10.1057/9781137001139"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195653861.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01440390008575315"", ""10.1177/001946460203900402"", ""10.1177/001946469303000304"", ""10.1080/00045600802118426""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/S0738248022000384,LAW AND HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0301 Law,"Before Equal Protection: The Fall of Cross-Dressing Bans and the Transgender Legal Movement, 1963-86","AbstractScholars are still unsure why American cities passed cross-dressing bans over the closing decades of the nineteenth century. By the 1960s, cities in every region of the United States had cross-dressing regulations, from major metropolitan centers to small cities and towns. They were used to criminalize gender non-conformity in many forms - for feminists, countercultural hippies, cross-dressers (or “transvestites”), and people we would now consider transgender. Starting in the late 1960s, however, criminal defendants began to topple cross-dressing bans.The story of their success invites a re-assessment of the contemporary LGBT movement’s legal history. This article argues that a trans legal movement developed separately but in tandem with constitutional claims on behalf of gays and lesbians. In some cases, gender outlaws attempted to defend the right to cross-dress without asking courts to understand or adjudicate their gender. These efforts met with mixed success: courts began to recognize their constitutional rights, but litigation also limited which gender outlaws could qualify as trans legal subjects. Examining their legal strategies offers a window into the messy process of translating gender non-conforming experiences and subjectivities into something that courts could understand. Transgender had to be analytically separated from gay and lesbian in life and law before it could be reattached as a distinct minority group.","[{""name"": ""Kate Redburn"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1073382"", ""10.1177/1363460717740258"", ""10.2307/3660710"", ""10.5215/pennlega.16.1.0006"", ""10.1353/jowh.2013.0062"", ""10.1007/s13178-010-0015-0"", ""10.2307/1073382"", ""10.1215/23289252-9311032""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Marketing', 'Social Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

I argue that the closed cities echoed and appropriated features of the Stalinist Gulag camp system, principally their adoption of physical isolation and the language of obfuscation. In doing so, I highlight a process called ‘atomized urbanism’ that embodies the tension between the obdurate reality of the city and the goal of the state to obliterate that reality through secrecy. In spatial terms, ‘atomized’ also describes the urban geography of these cities which lacked any kind of organic suburban expansion.","[{""name"": ""Asif Siddiqi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.56021/9781421405667"", ""10.1353/kri.2015.0049"", ""10.1016/0016-7185(87)90024-8"", ""10.2307/j.ctt5vkfds"", ""10.1177/0096144217710229"", ""10.4324/9781351019781"", ""10.1080/10889388.1996.10641026""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Our corpus contained 26,519 articles connected to these two historical events published between September 2017 and September 2020. We used a mixed-method approach by combining computational text analysis, namely, LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic models and qualitative methods. Our aim was not only to map the latent thematic structure and the discourses about Trianon and the Holocaust but also to identify the main differences in the rhetoric of the different sides of the political spectrum. Using Bull and Hansen’s categories, we found that the far-right and government media use the antagonistic, while the left-liberal media use the cosmopolitan mode of remembering. We identified many discursive differences between the rhetoric of the different political sides. Yet, the different relationship to emotions has the most far-reaching consequences. On the one hand, in antagonistic remembering, thus in the far-right and progovernment media, emotions play an essential role. On the other hand, cosmopolitan remembering, thus the rhetoric featured in the nongovernment media, detaches itself from emotions. This difference contributes significantly to the success of antagonistic remembering in Hungary. At the same time, the left-liberal side loses the opportunity to shape memory and identity politics.","[{""name"": ""Ildikó Barna"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Árpád Knap"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/pan/mpp034"", ""10.1080/21599165.2019.1703694"", ""10.1080/13642529.2014.890371"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2013.10.001"", ""10.1145/2684822.2685324"", ""10.1177/1012690219891656"", ""10.1080/21599165.2019.1662398"", ""10.1177/2053951715602908"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-54936-7_3"", ""10.1515/9789633861738-014"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00427.x"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0043"", ""10.1017/nps.2019.64"", ""10.1177/0956474820910071"", ""10.1002/epa2.1072"", ""10.1353/jod.2012.0051"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1288781"", ""10.1177/0888325412465085"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199375134.003.0002"", ""10.1080/13510347.2018.1455664"", ""10.1057/9781137485526_13"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1718657"", ""10.37415/studia/2012/51/4000"", ""10.1515/9786155225468-005"", ""10.1177/1750698015615935"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1787162"", ""10.1017/S1062798716000065"", ""10.1163/9789004386426_007"", ""10.1515/jnmlp-2017-0009"", ""10.1111/jtsb.12086"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2013.08.003"", ""10.1177/1012690210393828"", ""10.1177/0267323119897797"", ""10.3989/chdj.2014.016"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0199072"", ""10.1080/1352327042000260814"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02710-0_13"", ""10.1515/pce-2015-0010"", ""10.1177/2053951715599179"", ""10.1080/23745118.2016.1269442"", ""10.51624/SzocSzemle.2020.1.3"", ""10.1093/pa/gsn048"", ""10.3828/liverpool/9781906764715.003.0024"", ""10.1017/nps.2018.72"", ""10.1163/9789004191952""]","['Social Sciences', 'Computer Science']","['Communication', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'General Social Sciences']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)]]"
10.1017/jbr.2020.250,JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES,0603 World History,An Empire of Free Ports: British Commercial Imperialism in the 1766 Free Port Act,"AbstractThe Free Port Act of 1766 was an important reform in British political economy during the so-called imperial crisis between the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) and the American Revolution (1775–1783). In an explicit break from the letter if not the spirit of the Navigation Acts, the act opened six British ports in the West Indies (two in Dominica and four in Jamaica) to foreign merchants trading in a highly regulated number of goods subject to various duties. Largely understudied, this legislation has been characterized in most previous work on the subject as a fundamental break from British mercantile policies and meant to benefit North American colonial merchants. This article proposes a different interpretation. Based on the wider context of other imperial free port models, the loss of conquests such as French Guadeloupe and Martinique and Spanish Havana in the 1763 Paris Peace Treaty, a postwar downturn in Anglo-Spanish trade, and convincing testimonies by merchants and colonial observers, policy makers in London conceived of free ports primarily as a means of extending Britain's commercial empire. The free port system was designed to ruin the rival Dutch trade economically and shackle Spanish and French colonists to Britain's mercantile, manufacturing, and slaving economies. The reform marks a key moment in the evolution of British free trade imperial designs that became prevalent in the nineteenth century and beyond.","[{""name"": ""R.

Verification of these models is subject to the famous state space explosion problem. We alleviate this problem by exploiting a hierarchical structure with repetitive parts. This structure not only occurs naturally in robotics, but also in probabilistic programs describing, e.g., network protocols. Such programs often repeatedly call a subroutine with similar behavior. In this paper, we focus on a local case, in which the subroutines have a limited effect on the overall system state. The key ideas to accelerate analysis of such programs are (1) to treat the behavior of the subroutine as uncertain and only remove this uncertainty by a detailed analysis if needed, and (2) to abstract similar subroutines into a parametric template, and then analyse this template.

On top of today’s comprehensive eScience infrastructure, it enables the automated generation of possible workflows for a given specification. However, functionality for automated workflow composition tends to be integrated with one of the many available workflow management systems, and is thus difficult or impossible to apply in other environments. Therefore we have developed APE (the Automated Pipeline Explorer) as a command-line tool and API for automated composition of scientific workflows. APE is easily configured to a new application domain by providing it with a domain ontology and semantically annotated tools. It can then be used to synthesize purpose-specific workflows based on a specification of the available workflow inputs, desired outputs and possibly additional constraints. The workflows can further be transformed into executable implementations and/or exported into standard workflow formats. In this paper we describe APE v1.0 and discuss lessons learned from applications in bioinformatics and geosciences.","[{""name"": ""Vedran Kasalica"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anna-Lena Lamprecht"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.future.2017.05.041"", ""10.1145/1656274.1656280"", ""10.1038/nbt.3820"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139583923"", ""10.1109/MIS.2010.9"", ""10.1186/gb-2010-11-8-r86"", ""10.1093/bioinformatics/btt113"", ""10.1093/bib/bbz075"", ""10.1093/nar/gkv1116"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-16558-0_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-24302-9_34"", ""10.14279/tuj.eceasst.78.1092"", ""10.1111/tgis.12692"", ""10.1093/bioinformatics/bts480"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-45389-2"", ""10.1109/QUATIC.2010.53"", ""10.1186/2041-1480-2-S1-S5"", ""10.1038/npre.2010.5397.1"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28872-2_7"", ""10.1093/bioinformatics/bty646"", ""10.5311/JOSIS.2020.20.555"", ""10.1038/nbt.3772""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

Popular algorithms are policy iteration and variants of value iteration; in tool competitions, most participants rely on the latter. These algorithms generally need worst-case exponential time. However, the problem can equally be formulated as a linear program, solvable in polynomial time. In this paper, we give a detailed overview of today’s state-of-the-art algorithms for MDP model checking with a focus on performance and correctness. We highlight their fundamental differences, and describe various optimizations and implementation variants. We experimentally compare floating-point and exact-arithmetic implementations of all algorithms on three benchmark sets using two probabilistic model checkers. Our results show that (optimistic) value iteration is a sensible default, but other algorithms are preferable in specific settings. This paper thereby provides a guide for MDP verification practitioners—tool builders and users alike.","[{""name"": ""Arnd Hartmanns"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Junges"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tim Quatmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maximilian Weininger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.cie.2015.05.031"", ""10.1080/09720510.2017.1395182"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2207.14417"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91908-9_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_43"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_8"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2019.102"", ""10.1287/moor.16.3.580"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11936-6_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-83723-5_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69850-0_7"", ""10.1109/TAC.2021.3133265"", ""10.1007/11817963_11"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2022.104886"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14162-1_46"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-33386-6_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_18"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2013.08.020"", ""10.1145/2442829.2442858"", ""10.1287/ijoc.2016.0692"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11439-2_10"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2016.12.003"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_51"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7509474"", ""10.48550/ARXIV.2301.10197"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17462-0_20"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00633-z"", ""10.1007/s12532-017-0130-5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_26"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2022.104885"", ""10.1609/icaps.v25i1.13730"", ""10.1007/s10703-006-0005-2"", ""10.1007/s10703-020-00348-y"", ""10.1145/1102351.1102423"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_19"", ""10.1002/9780470316887"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_37"", ""10.1137/0907058"", ""10.2168/LMCS-11(1:15)2015"", ""10.1109/DDECS.2008.4538787"", ""10.1287/moor.1110.0516""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"
10.1017/S1479244320000347,MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY,0603 World History,A Factory Afield: Capitalism and Empire in John Locke's Political Economy,"Since the 1950s, interpreters of John Locke have debated whether his ideas about political economy figured among the intellectual sources of capitalist development. While some have labeled Locke a mercantile or agrarian “capitalist thinker,” others have insisted that, although a mercantilist, he was in no sense a theorist of capitalism. By reconstructing the relationship between Locke's ideas and the capitalist society of his day, this article challenges the prevailing terms through which commentators have traditionally interpreted his political economy and its place in the history of capitalism. I interpret Locke's perspectives on capital accumulation, foreign trade, and labor discipline throughout the 1690s as a reflection of the historical rise of export-oriented cycles of commodity manufacturing in the English countryside known as “proto-industrialization.” Moreover, I claim that, because proto-industrialization was tied to the expansion of England's colonial economy, this neglected context of Locke's economic doctrine sheds new light on his vision of empire. Looking to his writings on Ireland, I argue that Locke pursued proto-industrial economic reform by combining a hierarchical, stadial theory of progress with an imperial policy aimed at “improving” the colonies through decreed patterns of production and exchange that favored metropolitan trade.","[{""name"": ""Lucas G.

The elements of the underlying lifted analysis domain are tuples, which maintain one property per variant. Still, explicit property enumeration in tuples, one by one for all variants, immediately yields combinatorial explosion. This is particularly apparent in the case of program families that, apart from Boolean features, contain also numerical features with large domains, thus giving rise to astronomical configuration spaces.The key for an efficient lifted analysis is a proper handling of variability-specific constructs of the language (e.g., feature-based runtime tests and $$\texttt {\#if}$$ # if directives). In this work, we introduce a new symbolic representation of the lifted abstract domain that can efficiently analyze program families with numerical features. This makes sharing between property elements corresponding to different variants explicitly possible. The elements of the new lifted domain are constraint-based decision trees, where decision nodes are labeled with linear constraints defined over numerical features and the leaf nodes belong to an existing single-program analysis domain. To illustrate the potential of this representation, we have implemented an experimental lifted static analyzer, called SPLNum$$^2$$ 2 Analyzer, for inferring invariants of C programs.

In particular, the growing number of cyber-attacks targeting Internet of Things (IoT) systems restates the need for a reliable detection of malicious network activity. This paper presents a comparative analysis of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques on nine malware captures of the IoT-23 dataset, considering both binary and multi-class classification scenarios. The developed models consisted of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Isolation Forest (iForest), Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model based on a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQIN), adapted to the intrusion detection context. The most reliable performance was achieved by LightGBM. Nonetheless, iForest displayed good anomaly detection results and the DRL model demonstrated the possible benefits of employing this methodology to continuously improve the detection. Overall, the obtained results indicate that the analyzed techniques are well suited for IoT intrusion detection.","[{""name"": ""João Vitorino"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rui Andrade"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Isabel Praça"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Orlando Sousa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eva Maia"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/COMST.2019.2953364"", ""10.1109/TII.2018.2852491"", ""10.1109/COMST.2019.2910750"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2993363"", ""10.1002/dac.4443"", ""10.1109/GCWCN.2018.8668630"", ""10.1016/j.jnca.2020.102630"", ""10.1109/COMST.2019.2896380"", ""10.1109/JIOT.2019.2912022"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907965"", ""10.1109/LifeTech.2019.8884057"", ""10.1007/s11277-019-06986-8"", ""10.1109/MNET.001.1800479"", ""10.1109/JIOT.2020.2970501"", ""10.1109/WoWMoM49955.2020.00029"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2019.112963"", ""10.5281/ZENODO.4743746"", ""10.1186/s42400-019-0038-7"", ""10.3390/app9204396"", ""10.1109/5254.708428"", ""10.1145/2939672.2939785"", ""10.1109/ICDM.2008.17"", ""10.1145/342009.335388"", ""10.1609/aaai.v30i1.10295""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Networks and Communications', 'Signal Processing']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7598), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7575)]]"

Despite a long-standing knowledge of cattle, the earliest Nguni-speakers did not take to cattle-keeping as a way of life. Rather, the transition came as the result of changing social circumstances as households sought to manage the lifecycles of young men and reliably exploit their labor through gendered and generational expectations of decorum. Nguni-speakers grounded new concepts about cattle in older practices and norms regarding the social reproduction of young men. Agropastoralists situated cattle-keeping among the obligations young men faced after passing through initiation, giving cattle local salience. The transformation unfolded in gendered and generational household choices, but was shaped by the broad context of an increasingly interconnected Southern Africa.","[{""name"": ""Raevin Jimenez"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/BF01956132"", ""10.1017/S0021853700016431"", ""10.1007/s10963-016-9099-7"", ""10.5252/anthropozoologica2018v53a17"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-02894-0_4"", ""10.1007/BF01116874"", ""10.1023/A:1006796925891"", ""10.1007/s10437-016-9232-0"", ""10.2307/3858150"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.01.036"", ""10.1017/S0021853700017825"", ""10.1023/A:1006601020217"", ""10.1111/avsc.12310"", ""10.2307/3858143"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300218534.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781580467575"", ""10.1007/BF01118142"", ""10.1086/693960"", ""10.1080/0067270X.2016.1249586"", ""10.2307/3172118"", ""10.1017/S0021853700034101"", ""10.1080/00672709409511661"", ""10.2307/1160144"", ""10.1017/S0021853705000770"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139344333"", ""10.1016/j.quaint.2017.05.011"", ""10.1016/j.quaint.2017.08.019"", ""10.1073/pnas.1423953112"", ""10.2307/3889180"", ""10.1007/s10437-016-9231-1"", ""10.1080/00438243.1996.9980330"", ""10.2307/217698"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0198941"", ""10.1023/A:1026558503986"", ""10.1016/j.ttbdis.2016.02.005"", ""10.1525/ae.1990.17.2.02a00010"", ""10.1016/j.jaa.2016.07.001"", ""10.2307/281967"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511750984"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0134215"", ""10.1007/s12520-013-0121-z"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0071956"", ""10.1016/j.quascirev.2016.11.030"", ""10.15184/aqy.2014.50"", ""10.1086/432748"", ""10.1080/00438243.1984.9979905"", ""10.1080/0067270X.2015.1019262"", ""10.2307/3097285""]","['Social Sciences', 'Environmental Science']","['Archeology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)]]"

Their published works, as well as coffee plantation records, government correspondence, judicial records and other archival materials reveal how German coffee planters-cum-ethnographers drew upon ethnographic knowledge and representations to forge a reliable labor force. Like ethnographers in Britain's colonies, German settlers in Alta Verapaz understood the potential symmetry between ethnography and the governance of indigenous peoples. Their ethnographic knowledges also push us to reconsider distinctions drawn between German cosmopolitan ethnographic traditions and British functionalist ones and demonstrate how ethnographic knowledge and cultural difference could be deployed to forge new kinds of racial capitalism. In Guatemala, the intimate relationship between the rise of capitalism and ethnography shaped the anti-communism of mid-twentieth-century anthropology in the region.","[{""name"": ""Julie Gibbings"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/02757206.1994.9960856"", ""10.3998/mpub.17806"", ""10.13109/gege.2015.41.2.173"", ""10.1017/S0010417506000302"", ""10.1215/9780822382119"", ""10.1111/j.1935-4940.2010.01092.x"", ""10.1080/03086534.2013.836352"", ""10.3998/mpub.16162"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004139961.i-286"", ""10.2307/j.ctvhhhg6g"", ""10.1086/ahr.116.3.676"", ""10.1086/692991"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1d98c8k"", ""10.1525/9780520927742"", ""10.1093/gerhis/ghw017"", ""10.1017/9781108774048"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226306896.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315765709"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226772448.001.0001"", ""10.1215/00182168-3423892"", ""10.13109/gege.2017.43.3.381"", ""10.15460/HUP.HHF.6.142"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195065367.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400826698"", ""10.1215/9780822395591""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Part 1,"The efforts of liberal thinkers to incorporate mutualistic social principles into Americans’ understanding of liberalism extended through the century, but the strongest and most holistic conceptions of the social sphere took hold during the New Deal era and World War II. Contrary to recent accounts that locate the weakening of that social liberal project in the 1970s and attribute it to underlying economic changes, this article builds on two generations of historiography to argue that the decline began during the long 1950s when totalitarianism changed the political context of social thought. The theory of mass society that developed to explain the rise of totalitarianism replaced the citizens of liberal democratic theory with the anxious, rootless masses of modern society and forecast the collapse of liberal democracy into totalitarianism. Americans cast totalitarianism as the antithesis of America, its Other in the narrative of American identity, a threat both without and within. In that context, mutualistic conceptions of the social sphere were put on the defensive and individual liberty was valorized. Liberal intellectuals, trusting in American capitalism and in the weak social state, focused on the threat of McCarthyite anti-intellectualism and mass irrationality. Their commitment to social democracy weakened and their chief concern shifted to the no-longer-autonomous individuals of modern society.","[{""name"": ""Dorothy Ross"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4159/9780674984806"", ""10.1525/9780520310315"", ""10.2307/j.ctvmd85bc"", ""10.56021/9780801870378"", ""10.1093/jahist/96.2.379"", ""10.1177/039219215300100301"", ""10.4159/9780674054127"", ""10.1017/S1479244314000420"", ""10.2307/469262"", ""10.7312/bell13356"", ""10.2307/2078263"", ""10.1086/ahr.116.3.702"", ""10.2307/1852269"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1m592gq"", ""10.1177/039219216201003903"", ""10.1353/rah.2019.0067""]","['Social Sciences', 'Decision Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

It focuses on ordinary residents of the frontline regions who voluntarily got together to address the humanitarian and military consequences of war in the environment of lacking state support. It explores the micro-level dynamics of mobilization, particularly the demographic profile of civilian volunteers, their motivations to join, and pathways to engagement. In so doing, it provides an account of how ordinary residents of seemingly passive regions – Southern and Eastern Ukraine – become active in times of crisis. Contrary to the mainstream accounts that credit civilian mobilization to the rise of patriotism in wartime, it demonstrates that local security concerns and affective reactions to the heightened precarity of others are crucial factors that propel collective action at the rear. In the case of Ukraine, the efficiency of wartime mobilization was increased through the structures that emerged during the proceeding Maidan protests, as well as preexisting private and entrepreneurial networks. By employing ethnographic tools of inquiry, the article interrogates the mobilizing potential of seemingly latent communities in times of crisis and contributes to the literature on wartime collective action at the rear.","[{""name"": ""Nataliia Stepaniuk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3406/receo.2006.1788"", ""10.18523/kmlpj119977.2017-3.1-22"", ""10.1007/s11266-016-9819-8"", ""10.1080/00905999808408591"", ""10.5367/000000008785096647"", ""10.1504/IJESB.2010.033107"", ""10.1111/1471-0374.00018"", ""10.1080/0966813022000008438"", ""10.1515/9780691188270-008"", ""10.1017/S0043887100008091"", ""10.3167/aia.2008.150305"", ""10.18523/kmlpj119984.2017-3.23-45"", ""10.1177/109821400102200202"", ""10.1111/geoa.12072"", ""10.1023/A:1011159216578"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2003.09.006"", ""10.1353/jod.2002.0008"", ""10.1177/0725513616668621"", ""10.1080/13523270902860618"", ""10.2307/2669359"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1pnc1k7"", ""10.1080/13545700601184831"", ""10.1080/09668130050143815"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511761409"", ""10.1353/jod.2014.0045""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X20000643,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,WARTIME AND POST-WAR RAPE IN FRANCO'S SPAIN,"AbstractBy examining the experience of rape in Spain in the 1930s and 1940s, this article explains how the Spanish Civil War and Franco's dictatorship dramatically increased the likelihood of women becoming victims of sexual assault. Contrary to what historians often assume, this phenomenon was not the result of rape being deliberately used as a ‘weapon of war’ or as a blunt method of political repression against women. The upsurge in sexual violence was a by-product of structural transformations in the wartime and dictatorial contexts, and it was the direct consequence, rather than the instrument, of the violent imposition of a fascist-inspired regime. Using archival evidence from numerous Spanish archives, the article historicizes rape in a wider cultural, legal, and social context and reveals the essential albeit ambiguous political nature of both wartime and post-war rape. The experience of rape was mostly shaped not by repression but structural factors such as ruralization and social hierarchization, demographic upheavals, exacerbation of violent masculinity models, the proliferation of weapons, and the influence of fascist and national-Catholic ideologies. Rape became an expression of the nature of power and social and gender relations in Franco's regime.","[{""name"": ""ÁNGEL ALCALDE"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190277666.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0265691419833612"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtz019"", ""10.4324/9780203380727"", ""10.1353/jowh.2014.0055"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-43170-7_7"", ""10.1080/00438243.2020.1740775"", ""10.4000/books.etnograficapress.2880"", ""10.4324/9781315098814"", ""10.1057/9780230234291""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/ihs.2020.6,IRISH HISTORICAL STUDIES,0603 World History,"Violence against women in the Irish Civil War, 1922-3: gender-based harm in global perspective","AbstractSince the 1990s, in the wake of the wars and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, violence against women in wartime has become a matter of international concern. This article, on gender-based violence (G.B.V.) during the Irish Civil War, draws on research from scholars and activists around the globe, and newly accessible archival sources, to highlight the relatively humane treatment of women in Ireland – even during the bitter final stages of the Irish Revolution, c.1912–23. Records of the Irish Free State's Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee show that women suffered some serious and traumatising interpersonal violence during 1922–3 – often on account of their gender (as guardians of the domestic space). Women's interactions with the Civil War were thus distinctive from men's because of the prevalence in Ireland of forms of aggression and intimidation, including crimes against property, which transgressed public/private boundaries. However, I argue that it did not serve the strategy nor ideology of either warring side to denigrate women en masse. The genocidal aims underlying conflict-related G.B.V. elsewhere in the world were absent in Ireland, where gendered power structures, shored up by Catholic authority, remained largely unshaken by the revolution – despite the great efforts of many radical females. Revolutionary Ireland was not a safe place for many Irishwomen (nor indeed for some men); however, for pro- and anti-Treaty forces, maintaining propriety militated against the need for sexual violence as warfare.","[{""name"": ""Gemma Clark"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0080440105000307"", ""10.1177/0038038518773926"", ""10.9783/9780812204346"", ""10.1057/9781137283399""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Nonetheless, I argue that we can learn something about the role of nationalism in the management of public health crises by looking at the variable state responses to the arrival of the virus within their borders. In the modern international system, state governments are tasked with safeguarding the health and well-being of their national populations. During national emergencies, sovereigntist movements form around competing images of the nation that deserves protection. This article uses political artwork to show how different images of the idealized sovereign community were employed to justify divergent pandemic policies of US President Donald Trump and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Over the course of the pandemic, both leaders came under fire for failing to protect their constituents, providing space for alternative leaders and models of national protection.","[{""name"": ""Erin K.

We tackle this—generally undecidable—problem by computing under-approximations on these total expected rewards. This is done by abstracting finite unfoldings of the infinite belief MDP of the POMDP. The key issue is to find a suitable under-approximation of the value function. We provide two techniques: a simple (cut-off) technique that uses a good policy on the POMDP, and a more advanced technique (belief clipping) that uses minimal shifts of probabilities between beliefs. We use mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to find such minimal probability shifts and experimentally show that our techniques scale quite well while providing tight lower bounds on the expected total reward.","[{""name"": ""Alexander Bork"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joost-Pieter Katoen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tim Quatmann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10458-009-9103-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_19"", ""10.1016/0022-247X(65)90154-X"", ""10.1512/iumj.1957.6.56038"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_16"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5643643"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11936-6_8"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2020/570"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2019/768"", ""10.1609/aaai.v30i1.10422"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2016.01.007"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15155-2_24"", ""10.1145/1390156.1390189"", ""10.1287/opre.32.5.1107"", ""10.1613/jair.678"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00633-z"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/662"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2007.03.004"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46520-3_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_28"", ""10.1016/S0004-3702(98)00023-X"", ""10.15607/RSS.2008.IV.009"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_47"", ""10.1287/opre.39.1.162"", ""10.1016/S0004-3702(02)00378-8"", ""10.1287/mnsc.28.1.1"", ""10.1007/s11241-017-9269-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_37"", ""10.1007/s10458-012-9200-2"", ""10.1287/opre.21.5.1071"", ""10.1287/opre.26.2.282"", ""10.1613/jair.1659"", ""10.1109/TII.2017.2710316"", ""10.1109/CDC.2017.8263971"", ""10.1613/jair.761""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X21000273,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,Tobacco-Taking and Identity-Making in Early Modern Britain and North America,"AbstractThis article explores the praxis of transatlantic snuff- and tobacco-taking and its importance to personal and national identity-making over the long eighteenth century. It focuses in particular on the role of snuff- and tobacco boxes, which uniquely provided white middling-sorts on both sides of the Atlantic with a socialized canvas upon which significant statements of status, personality, and sensibility could be made. However, a closer study of these objects during America's revolutionary period reveals stark contrasts in the social, political, and gendered meanings ascribed to tobacco-taking between Britain and America. The material evidence, it is argued, suggests that for men, and especially for women in revolutionary America, snuff- and tobacco-taking became almost synonymous with loyalty to the republic.","[{""name"": ""Angela McShane"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/3254683"", ""10.1086/SHAD27020156"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6563.1970.tb01145.x"", ""10.1093/past/119.1.73"", ""10.1177/13684310222225432"", ""10.1002/9781118241912"", ""10.2307/1925315"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198842460.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1856118"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226037448.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0018246X11000197"", ""10.1353/eam.2012.0017"", ""10.2307/361777"", ""10.2307/1512854"", ""10.1017/9780511978814"", ""10.2307/1593989"", ""10.2307/1902930"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511527470"", ""10.1017/S0022050700085235""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Marketing', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Working within a GIS environment, the authors spatially analyse over 3,500 events recorded by theUfficio del fangoconcerning violations of the city's health-related ordinances, augmented by other demographic and material data. As such, the study not only adds specificity to recent attempts to enrich the field of pre-modern public health, but also demonstrates that the Bolognese administration had a sophisticated and evolving understanding of communal health risks, and exposes several discrepancies between policy and practice.","[{""name"": ""Taylor Zaneri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G.

However, current models lack interoperability and are insufficient for representing music history and the cultural heritage context in which it was generated; risking the propagation of recency and cultural biases to downstream applications. In this article, we propose the Polifonia Ontology Network (PON) for music cultural heritage, centred around four modules: Music Meta (metadata), Representation (content), Source (provenance) and Instrument (cultural objects). We design PON with a strong accent on cultural stakeholder requirements and competency questions (CQs), contributing an NLP-based toolkit to support knowledge engineers in generating, validating, and analysing them; and a novel, high-quality CQ dataset produced as a result. We show current and future use of these resources by internal project pilots, early adopters in the music industry, and opportunities for the Semantic Web and Music Information Retrieval communities.","[{""name"": ""Jacopo de Berardinis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Valentina Anita Carriero"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nitisha Jain"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicolas Lazzari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Albert Meroño-Peñuela"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea Poltronieri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Valentina Presutti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3543507.3587428"", ""10.1038/s41597-023-02410-w"", ""10.3233/978-1-61499-676-7-23"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-16438-5_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-65370-9_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30796-7_3"", ""10.3233/SW-200422"", ""10.3233/SSW200033"", ""10.1145/3148011.3148038"", ""10.1145/3148011.3148038"", ""10.1017/S1351324916000334"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-03915-7_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11955-7_42"", ""10.1080/09298215.2010.536555"", ""10.3233/978-1-61499-676-7-299"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-92673-3_10"", ""10.1207/S15327590IJHC143&4_13"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-34847-6_3"", ""10.17613/4crx-fr36"", ""10.3233/SW-120092"", ""10.1145/3106426.3110325"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2022.100754"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36543-0_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-25931-4_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-70407-4_9"", ""10.2200/S01114ED1V01Y202107DSK021"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68204-4_16"", ""10.3233/SW-223105"", ""10.1145/3243907.3243913"", ""10.18653/v1/D19-1410"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-01307-2_89"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-15743-1_51"", ""10.1109/ICSC.2016.61"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2020.100548"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2021.100687""]","['Computer Science', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Music', 'Signal Processing']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7598), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7575)]]"

Using network analysis and a large prosopographic database, this article approaches this question from four perspectives: the marriage network of political elites, the backgrounds of chief ministers, the composition of the capital elite during three time slices, and the makeup of the provincial elite. Despite important continuities in the elite marriage network's basic structure, there were also significant discontinuities. Between the seventh and eighth centuries, Luoyang emerged as a secondary political center, and Luoyang-based families—including so-called “marriage-ban” clans—acquired a renewed significance, partly at the expense of old southern clans, whose political significance declined over the course of the dynasty. In addition, the political divide between capital and provinces grew over time, culminating in the ninth century with capital-based men occupying nearly all significant provincial posts and provincials serving only locally and in second-tier offices.","[{""name"": ""Nicolas Tackett"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctt1dnnb85"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139343848"", ""10.2307/2719000"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1dnnb64"", ""10.2307/2718666"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511759857"", ""10.1353/sys.2016.0005""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This essay is an attempt to partake in this conversation, not only because my work is under discussion but because I wish to engage with some of the key arguments in the debate to clarify some misunderstandings and suggest ways that the Arab Spring allows for a new thinking about revolution and revolutionary theory.

Our main results show that warm weeks led to elevated mortality in the late nineteenth century, mainly due to infant deaths from digestive diseases. However, this pattern largely disappeared after WWI as infant digestive diseases became less prevalent. The resulting change in the temperature-mortality relationship meant that thousands of heat-related deaths—equal to 0.9-1.4 percent of all deaths— were averted. These findings show that improving the disease environment can dramatically alter the impact of high temperature on mortality.","[{""name"": ""W.

This humanitarianism identified a collective humanity as the source of its own salvation, rather than an external, well-meaning benefactor. Unlike liberal models of advocacy, which invoked individualized actors and recipients of their care, socialists privileged solidarity within their community and rejected the foundational logic of liberal individualism. In tracing this history, this article considers its importance for contemporary debates about humanitarianism’s imperial power dynamics.","[{""name"": ""NAOMI J.

PARETO,"This paper proposes a genealogy of the concept of homo œconomicus as it emerged from the methodological debate on the economic agent of political economy. If John Stuart Mill gave birth to the economic man in his 1836 essay “On the Definition of Political Economy,” he certainly did not baptize him. The expression was introduced by Francis A. Walker after Mill passed away in the 1870s. Economic man acquired its Latin name of homo œconomicus under the pen of French Catholic economist Claudio Jannet in 1878. Yet, only at the end of the century did Maffeo Pantaleoni (1889) proudly reclaim homo œconomicus as a building block of pure economics. In reaction to the evolutionary hedonism of Pantaleoni, Vilfredo Pareto then cleansed the concept of homo œconomicus and realized the Millian project of an abstract science based on an economic agent.","[{""name"": ""Michele Bee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maxime Desmarais-Tremblay"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4337/9781781956472"", ""10.3917/puf.demeu.2003.01"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511612602"", ""10.1215/00182702-4-2-344"", ""10.1017/S1053837200004521"", ""10.1086/516395"", ""10.1257/jep.9.2.221"", ""10.1017/S1053837200001565"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511596728"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-58436-2_9"", ""10.1086/250376"", ""10.1080/10427710050122558"", ""10.1057/9781137374158"", ""10.1080/09672567.2016.1148753"", ""10.1215/00182702-6-2-119"", ""10.2307/1883645"", ""10.2307/1882972"", ""10.1215/00182702-33-1-21"", ""10.4337/9781849803229"", ""10.1086/260376"", ""10.1215/00182702-30-2-171"", ""10.1016/S0039-3681(99)00030-8"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190460631.001.0001"", ""10.1177/053901898037001002"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92549-3"", ""10.1080/10427710500509763"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2007.02005.x"", ""10.1080/10427710050122567"", ""10.1515/9781400861514"", ""10.1017/9781107337541.009"", ""10.1080/09672560903204551"", ""10.1257/aer.106.7.1577"", ""10.1002/1520-6696(199201)28:1<28::AID-JHBS2300280103>3.0.CO;2-L"", ""10.4000/ress.2510"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511528224"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199372768.001.0001"", ""10.3406/outre.1990.2811"", ""10.1007/s10818-015-9196-1"", ""10.4324/9780429453236"", ""10.4324/9780203469088"", ""10.1057/9780230596269"", ""10.1093/oseo/instance.00077240"", ""10.1215/00182702-3452291"", ""10.1080/17530350.2016.1233903"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226735719.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

However, the family of operations that delimit scopes are not algebraic and are usually modelled as handlers, thus preventing them from being used freely in conjunction with algebraic operations. Although proposals for scoped operations exist, they are either ad-hoc and unprincipled, or too inconvenient for practical programming. This paper provides the best of both worlds: a theoretically-founded model of scoped effects that is convenient for implementation and reasoning. Our new model is based on an adjunction between a locally finitely presentable category and a category of functorial algebras. Using comparison functors between adjunctions, we show that our new model, an existing indexed model, and a third approach that simulates scoped operations in terms of algebraic ones have equal expressivity for handling scoped operations. We consider our new model to be the sweet spot between ease of implementation and structuredness. Additionally, our approach automatically induces fusion laws of handlers of scoped effects, which are useful for reasoning and optimisation.","[{""name"": ""Zhixuan Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marco Paviotti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicolas Wu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Birthe van den Berg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tom Schrijvers"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511600579"", ""10.1145/3434305"", ""10.1007/3-540-60164-3_25"", ""10.1007/BF01111838"", ""10.2168/lmcs-10(4:9)2014"", ""10.1016/j.jlamp.2014.02.001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-89051-3_11"", ""10.1007/s001650050047"", ""10.1017/S0956796899003342"", ""10.1145/1291220.1291199"", ""10.1145/362929.362947"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2008.12.052"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15155-2_33"", ""10.1109/LICS.1999.782615"", ""10.1109/LICS.2001.932486"", ""10.1145/976571.976580"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02768-1_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-24276-2_2"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2006.03.013"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2007.02.019"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73228-0_16"", ""10.1145/1328438.1328475"", ""10.1145/2544174.2500590"", ""10.1145/2103656.2103698"", ""10.1016/0022-4049(93)90092-8"", ""10.1145/3473577"", ""10.1145/2804302.2804319"", ""10.1017/S0956796820000271"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009872"", ""10.1016/S1571-0661(04)80568-1"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0954-6"", ""10.1145/199448.199528"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009897"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2004.07.025"", ""10.1016/0890-5401(91)90052-4"", ""10.1145/3209108.3209166"", ""10.4204/eptcs.76.8"", ""10.1007/3-540-45931-6_24"", ""10.1023/A:1023064908962"", ""10.1109/LICS.2008.45"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-00590-9_7"", ""10.2168/lmcs-9(4:23)2013"", ""10.1007/s001650200014"", ""10.1145/3331545.3342595"", ""10.1017/S0956796809007321"", ""10.1016/0167-6423(90)90056-J"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2007.09.024"", ""10.1109/LICS.2013.58"", ""10.1145/174675.178068"", ""10.1017/S0956796808006758"", ""10.1145/224164.224221"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(90)90147-A"", ""10.1145/91556.91592"", ""10.5555/647698.734146"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-19797-5_15"", ""10.1145/2633357.2633358"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5914133"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99336-8_17"", ""10.1145/3473578""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1017/mit.2021.28,MODERN ITALY,0603 World History; 0705 Geography,Somewhere over the rainbow: Italy and the regulation of same-sex unions,"While almost all European democracies from the 1980s started to accord legal recognition to same-sex couples, Italy was, in 2016, the last West European country to adopt a regulation, after a tortuous path. Why was Italy such a latecomer? What kind of barriers were encountered by the legislative process? What were the factors behind the policy change? To answer these questions, this article first discusses current morality policymaking, paying specific attention to the literature dealing with same-sex partnerships. Second, it provides a reconstruction of the Italian policy trajectory, from the entrance of the issue into political debate until the enactment of the civil union law, by considering both partisan and societal actors for and against the legislative initiative. The article argues that the Italian progress towards the regulation of same-sex unions depended on the balance of power between change and blocking coalitions and their degree of congruence during the policymaking process. In 2016 the government formed a broad consensus and the parliament passed a law on civil unions. However, the new law represented only a small departure from the status quo due to the low congruence between actors within the change coalition.","[{""name"": ""Alessia Donà"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-62764-9"", ""10.1163/15691330-12341234"", ""10.1007/s13178-013-0125-6"", ""10.1177/1363460717713386"", ""10.1017/mit.2019.63"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-09731-2_7"", ""10.1080/13501763.2013.761500"", ""10.1080/13501763.2013.761512"", ""10.1093/0199257566.003.0012"", ""10.1080/14616696.2018.1536801"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00300.x"", ""10.1080/01402380802509826"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.909170"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1147057"", ""10.1080/13563467.2015.1134465"", ""10.1007/s11113-020-09613-8"", ""10.1093/sp/jxs024"", ""10.1080/13545710601132912"", ""10.1080/23248823.2020.1715594"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-20169-2"", ""10.1080/23248823.2015.1041250"", ""10.1080/23248823.2021.1947629"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1228693"", ""10.1080/13501763.2014.951066"", ""10.1093/sp/jxt006"", ""10.1080/13501763.2013.761503"", ""10.1017/S0007123400007225"", ""10.1017/mit.2018.7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37054-1"", ""10.1515/9781400831456"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12233""]","['Social Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Gender Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

An example drawn from Canadian census records illustrates the nature of bias that may afflict even a carefully linked sample. The use of potentially time-varying match criteria doubles the size of a linked sample at a modest cost in terms of additional bias. This trade-off is attractive for some research purposes if care is taken in the uses to which the data are put.

This study is undertaken to make a comparative assessment of the 1932–1934 direct losses within and between UkrSSR and RSFSR in order to answer the questions as to whether the major grain-producing areas of both republics suffered from the Famine to the same extent and whether the intensity of regional losses was determined exclusively by the grain specialization of the region. Our results show that the regions seriously affected by the Famine comprised a much larger proportion (in terms of territory and population) of UkrSSR than of the RSFSR. The highest excess deaths in UkrSSR are found in the regions that did not play a major role in grain procurement, while in the RSFSSR four grain-producing regions suffered the most. Our analysis suggests that (a) the link between Famine losses and grain procurement is not confirmed in Ukraine, but is partially confirmed in Russia, and (b) extremely high losses are mostly found in the regions where repression policies were much more severe than those introduced elsewhere and for which nationality may be a key factor.","[{""name"": ""Nataliia Levchuk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oleh Wolowyna"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Omelian Rudnytskyi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alla Kovbasiuk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Natalia Kulyk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.21226/T2T59X"", ""10.7591/9781501713323"", ""10.3406/cmr.1994.2663"", ""10.3406/cmr.1994.2661"", ""10.25336/P6FC7G"", ""10.2307/2500600"", ""10.25336/P6KC7Q""]",['Social Sciences'],['Urban Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

We show that the growth-enhancing effect of the railway was much greater in parishes that were larger and more industrial at the outset. However, such early industrial parishes were rare in the relatively poor German state. This might explain why we find small average growth effects, which only increase at the end of the nineteenth century. Heterogeneity in the impact of the railway thus increased economic disparities within Württemberg and contributed to the state’s relatively sluggish growth.","[{""name"": ""Sebastian Till Braun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Richard Franke"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Finally, the comparison of our dataset on female occupations from tax records with other European cases calls for a revision of the literature and the development of a more nuanced picture of the north-south divide.","[{""name"": ""Filipa Ribeiro da Silva"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hélder Carvalhal"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/1081602X.2014.929528"", ""10.1016/j.hisfam.2011.08.005"", ""10.1163/9789004231443_016"", ""10.1080/13545701.2012.734630"", ""10.1017/S0022050719000056"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198205548.001.0001"", ""10.3989/hispania.2004.v64.i216.200"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511561207"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511522659.002"", ""10.1080/13545701.2012.746465"", ""10.1177/0096144215610770"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00483.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190240615.003.0009"", ""10.1353/jsh.2002.0039"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897535.018"", ""10.1080/13545701.2013.842283"", ""10.1111/ehr.12733"", ""10.2307/2597872"", ""10.2307/2671287"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004175174.i-346"", ""10.1017/S0020859006002422"", ""10.4324/9780203702727""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Without the aid of automation, ensuring the security of an ever-increasing number of deployments becomes more and more challenging. To the best of our knowledge, no formal automated technique currently exists to verify cloud deployments during the design phase. In this case study, we show that Description Logic modeling and inference capabilities can be used to improve the safety of cloud configurations. We focus on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) proprietary declarative language, CloudFormation, and develop a tool to encode template files into logic. We query the resulting models with properties related to security posture and report on our findings. By extending the models with dataflow-specific knowledge, we use more comprehensive semantic reasoning to further support security reviews. When applying the developed toolchain to publicly available deployment files, we find numerous violations of widely-recognized security best practices, which suggests that streamlining the methodologies developed for this case study would be beneficial.","[{""name"": ""Claudia Cauli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Meng Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nir Piterman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oksana Tkachuk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/9781139025355"", ""10.1016/S1574-6526(07)03003-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25543-5_14"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8602994"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-7535-4_22"", ""10.1145/2506164.2506167"", ""10.1007/3-540-48683-6_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-27836-8_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_3"", ""10.1109/ASE.2008.78"", ""10.1007/s10817-014-9305-1"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2008.05.001"", ""10.1007/11817963_18"", ""10.3233/SW-2011-0025"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2003.07.001"", ""10.1093/logcom/6.4.523"", ""10.1145/2757001.2757003"", ""10.1007/3-540-45744-5_7"", ""10.1016/0004-3702(91)90078-X"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2007.03.004"", ""10.1007/11814771_26""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.1017/jbr.2020.41,JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES,0603 World History,Political Engines: The Emotional Politics of Bells in Eighteenth-Century England,"AbstractThis article asks how and why bells maintained their central place in political culture between 1660 and 1832, a question that can best be approached from the perspective of histories of the emotions and senses. Such a consideration of bells allows us to extend the concept of “emotives” to encompass material culture. Often believed to “speak,” bells were fundamental to a binary emotional regime: the joy and sorrow they expressed and created were essential to perceptions of deference, community, and national feeling. But they could also be inverted and used a form of resistance. For those outside the religious or political status quo, bells could instantiate forms of emotional suffering. Tracing the “listening public” of which bells were part demonstrates the importance of the freedom to hear in the eighteenth-century public sphere. In this context, the ascription of material and emotional agency to bells was a useful rhetorical tool. Its deployment in newspaper reports of ringing, which served to encourage certain ways of listening, points to the importance of both text and sound in creating a “listening public.” But this listening public was also marked by forms of emotional suffering and exclusion that trouble the place of practices of celebration in any nascent “English” or “British” identity.","[{""name"": ""William Tullett"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9781137316530"", ""10.1017/S0963926803001019"", ""10.1177/095269519500800404"", ""10.1093/ehr/CXVI.468.863""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Museology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Unfortunately, parametric polymorphism even in its restricted prenex form is not fully understood in the context of session types. In this paper, we present the metatheory of session types extended with prenex polymorphism and, as a result, nested recursive datatypes. Remarkably, we prove that type equality is decidable by exhibiting a reduction to trace equivalence of deterministic first-order grammars. Recognizing the high theoretical complexity of the latter, we also propose a novel type equality algorithm and prove its soundness. We observe that the algorithm is surprisingly efficient and, despite its incompleteness, sufficient for all our examples. We have implemented our ideas by extending the Rast programming language with nested session types. We conclude with several examples illustrating the expressivity of our enhanced type system.","[{""name"": ""Ankush Das"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henry DeYoung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andreia Mordido"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frank Pfenning"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_3"", ""10.1007/BFb0015048"", ""10.1007/BFb0054285"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.59.5"", ""10.2168/LMCS-8(1:17)2012"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-37036-6_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15375-4_16"", ""10.1017/S0960129514000218"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2008.11.006"", ""10.1017/S0960129500000803"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.162.4"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2017.06.002"", ""10.1145/3236786"", ""10.1145/3209108.3209146"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.FSCD.2020.33"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.CONCUR.2020.13"", ""10.1145/3414080.3414087"", ""10.1007/BF01443322"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(76)90074-8"", ""10.1007/s00236-005-0177-z"", ""10.1017/S0960129508006944"", ""10.1007/BFb0014972"", ""10.2172/1562827"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39274-0_16"", ""10.1017/S0956796800003713"", ""10.1007/3-540-57208-2_35"", ""10.2168/LMCS-9(1:10)2013"", ""10.1007/s10990-009-9047-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-40007-3_26"", ""10.1109/SWAT.1966.22"", ""10.1145/2951913.2951921"", ""10.1007/3-540-12925-1_41"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2014.08.001"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46678-0_1"", ""10.1145/345099.345100"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(02)00027-0"", ""10.1145/512760.512765"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(00)00389-3"", ""10.1007/3-540-58184-7_118"", ""10.1145/2951913.2951926"", ""10.1145/3371135"", ""10.1145/2364527.2364568""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

In particular, this contribution considers two MPS general meetings, respectively held in 1982 and 1990, which were dedicated to the issue of European integration. Drawing on both primary and secondary sources, this article first assesses how neoliberal thinkers commented on and interpreted the EEC transformations during the 1980s. Second, it challenges the assumption according to which the run-up to the establishment of the EU was the outcome of a consolidated project of neoliberalisation of the EEC and EU institutions. Finally, this article shows in which terms these neoliberal thinkers conceived of the depoliticisation of European institutions after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the looming end of the Cold War.","[{""name"": ""Roberto Ventresca"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5771/0947-9511-2018-2-335"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199283262.001.0001"", ""10.3167/9780857452887"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139381857.008"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtz016"", ""10.4159/9780674919808"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-65163-7"", ""10.1017/S0960777319000158"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-03171-9"", ""10.1080/14682740701218882"", ""10.1080/13507486.2019.1610361"", ""10.2753/0577-5132510208"", ""10.2307/j.ctvrs8zfp"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2867r6"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511998164"", ""10.1093/019829638X.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198735915.003.0005"", ""10.1080/14794012.2018.1482709"", ""10.1080/13507486.2019.1604636"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511610004"", ""10.1080/13501761003662040"", ""10.1177/095892879600600101"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199276660.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10838-007-9049-2""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

By using Bosnia and Herzegovina as a case study, it analyzes movement framing in three waves of social protests that occurred in the country in the last decade. Specifically, it investigates the diverse ways in which movement leaders tackled ethnicity in their discourses. The article shows that movement leaders’ narratives rested, respectively, on the primacy of human and citizenship rights, a common feeling of deprivation, and victimhood. Their approach toward ethnicity, however, differed in each wave. Ethnicity was openly rejected in 2013, avoided and not openly contested in 2014, and accepted and approached as an opportunity to bring further support to the movement in 2018. The article highlights that ethnicity can be tackled differently by social movement actors mobilizing on nonethnic grounds in divided societies, and that it might constitute a vantage point for social mobilization rather than a drawback, contributing to raising transversal solidarity.","[{""name"": ""Chiara Milan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13537113.2019.1639426"", ""10.1515/9789048531356-008"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.611"", ""10.1515/9789048528639-011"", ""10.1080/13537113.2018.1489488"", ""10.1080/09668136.2017.1388358"", ""10.1017/nps.2018.8"", ""10.1162/002081800551398"", ""10.1177/0308275X17719988"", ""10.1111/plar.12343"", ""10.4324/9781315574424-5"", ""10.1017/nps.2019.61"", ""10.4324/9781315716770"", ""10.2307/2009820"", ""10.4324/9781315167985-2"", ""10.1080/13533310500074564"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.283"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.10403-9"", ""10.1080/13530194.2020.1715788"", ""10.4159/9780674258143"", ""10.4324/9781315167985"", ""10.1080/09668136.2015.1019430"", ""10.1111/j.1754-9469.2011.01134.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973529"", ""10.1177/0888325418767505"", ""10.2307/2095581"", ""10.1080/14742830802485700"", ""10.2307/j.ctvw04b67.6"", ""10.1080/13537113.2016.1169060"", ""10.2307/j.ctvw04gv6""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Complementing traditional testing techniques for these solvers with randomized stress testing has been shown to be quite effective. Recent work has showcased the value of input fuzzing for finding issues, but this approach typically does not comprehensively test a solver’s API. Previous work on model-based API fuzzing was tailored to a single solver and a small subset of SMT-LIB. We present Murxla, a comprehensive, modular, and highly extensible model-based API fuzzer for SMT solvers. Murxla randomly generates valid sequences of solver API calls based on a customizable API model, with full support for the semantics and features of SMT-LIB. It is solver-agnostic but extensible to allow for solver-specific testing and supports option fuzzing, cross-checking with other solvers, translation to SMT-LIBv2, and SMT-LIBv2 input fuzzing. Our evaluation confirms its efficacy in finding issues in multiple state-of-the-art SMT solvers.","[{""name"": ""Aina Niemetz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mathias Preiner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clark Barrett"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/FMCAD.2013.6679385"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38916-0_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99524-9_24"", ""10.1007/11804192_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39611-3_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96142-2_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02959-2_12"", ""10.1145/1670412.1670413"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41540-6_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31759-0_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24318-4_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-33826-7_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_49"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-37036-6_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73368-3_52"", ""10.1145/2093548.2093564"", ""10.1145/1993316.1993506"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41600-3_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-40970-2_35"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-17511-4_20"", ""10.1145/3368089.3409763"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8603014"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_32"", ""10.1145/3485529"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-90870-6_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-79124-9_10"", ""10.1145/3428261"", ""10.1145/3385412.3385985"", ""10.1109/32.988498""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Information Systems', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

It shows a peeling movement from Cameroon's grassfields, into southern Cameroon, then along a savanna corridor through West Central Africa's rainforests, into the Savannahs, then to Southern Africa, the Great Lakes, and Indian Ocean coast. The clear sequence of movement masks methodological and historical factors. Language death, multilingualism, and the limits of vocabulary evidence restrain the classification's authority. ‘Transformations’ from food collecting to food producing or from no metals to full engagement with metals were mutable, unfolded at different speeds, and involved interactions with firstcomers. In Central Africa, Bantu speakers were often the first farmers and metal-users in the region but elsewhere they were commonly neither. Their arrivals did not immediately displace firstcomers. Computational methods can accommodate many of these issues.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Grollemund"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Schoenbrun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Vansina"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0021853700034101"", ""10.1086/soutjanth.5.4.3628591"", ""10.1086/464321"", ""10.2307/3171667"", ""10.1073/pnas.1503793112"", ""10.2307/3171750"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91036-9"", ""10.1017/S0021853797007044"", ""10.1080/0067270X.2011.629525"", ""10.1075/cilt.6"", ""10.1002/evan.20150"", ""10.1075/dia.30.4.01bos"", ""10.1080/00672709409511659"", ""10.1007/s10437-011-9104-6"", ""10.1017/S0959774316000317"", ""10.1353/hia.2006.0022"", ""10.1007/s10437-020-09363-0"", ""10.1163/24519197-00000010"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139344333"", ""10.1017/S0021853720000365"", ""10.1515/9781580467575"", ""10.1080/0067270X.2019.1619282"", ""10.1007/BF01116842"", ""10.1038/s41598-020-71374-3"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0198941""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Linguistics and Language', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Longobardo criticized the use of indigenous Chinese vocabulary by Matteo Ricci to express Christian concepts as a perilous accommodation to diabolical monism. This article proposes a close reading of how Longobardo employed Scholastic, humanist, and Chinese sources to critique Ricci's disregard for the neo-Confucian interpreters in his reading of ancient Confucianism.

In this paper, we develop the first local search algorithm for SMT (LIA) by directly operating on variables, breaking through the traditional framework. We propose a local search framework by considering the distinctions between Boolean and integer variables. Moreover, we design a novel operator and scoring functions tailored for LIA, and propose a two-level operation selection heuristic. Putting these together, we develop a local search SMT (LIA) solver called LS-LIA. Experiments are carried out to evaluate LS-LIA on benchmarks from SMTLIB and two benchmark sets generated from job shop scheduling and data race detection. The results show that LS-LIA is competitive and complementary with state-of-the-art SMT solvers, and performs particularly well on those formulae with only integer variables. A simple sequential portfolio with Z3 improves the state-of-the-art on satisfiable benchmark sets of LIA and IDL benchmarks from SMT-LIB. LS-LIA also solves Job Shop Scheduling benchmarks substantially faster than traditional complete SMT solvers.","[{""name"": ""Shaowei Cai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bohan Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xindi Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-31612-8_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_11"", ""10.1145/1167515.1167488"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-29436-6_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-40229-1_9"", ""10.1007/3-540-45657-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24318-4_1"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2013.09.001"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31759-0_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_7"", ""10.29007/qqvt"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/11817963_11"", ""10.1609/aaai.v29i1.9372"", ""10.1007/11691372_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_19"", ""10.1007/978-1-4613-0303-9_33"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-24364-6_12"", ""10.1145/2666356.2594315"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-04238-6_14"", ""10.1109/FMCAD.2013.6679409"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31612-8_43"", ""10.1007/s10009-015-0366-1"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-1793-7_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_11"", ""10.1007/11513988_33"", ""10.1145/1217856.1217859"", ""10.1016/S0890-5401(02)93175-5"", ""10.1109/COASE.2018.8560344"", ""10.1090/dimacs/026/25"", ""10.1145/775832.775945"", ""10.1007/3-540-45657-0_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-27813-9_12"", ""10.1145/1146909.1146971""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"
10.1017/S1479244319000271,MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Keynes Goes Nuclear: Thomas Schelling and the Macroeconomic Origins of Strategic Stability,"Among the most important ideas in Cold War nuclear strategy and arms control was that of “stability”—the notion that by protecting weapons for use in retaliation, the superpowers would be less likely to fight a thermonuclear war. Conventional wisdom among strategists and historians of strategy has long held that stability was inherent to the logic of rational nuclear deterrence. This essay shows the conventional wisdom to be mistaken. It examines the technical practice of Thomas Schelling, who introduced the stability idea in a classic 1958 paper. Celebrated as a game theorist, Schelling was actually trained as a Keynesian macroeconomic modeler during the second half of the 1940s. In 1958, he used Keynesian techniques to frame deterrence as a stable system of dynamic adjustment, akin to the stable macroeconomic system he had modeled as a young economist. Among Schelling's fellow strategists, stability quickly became popular as a rationalization for their preferred nuclear deployment policies.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Wilson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/20042570"", ""10.2307/1883322"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00273"", ""10.2307/2009945"", ""10.1111/1467-7709.00079"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226873763.001.0001"", ""10.1017/eis.2017.6"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226668253.001.0001"", ""10.1177/002200275700100104"", ""10.1257/jep.3.2.153"", ""10.1017/S0266267110000040"", ""10.1515/9781400875108"", ""10.2307/20029345"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800164"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674062849"", ""10.1017/S1479244309002145"", ""10.1215/9780822383802-001"", ""10.4324/9780203502136"", ""10.2307/1926753"", ""10.1287/opre.9.5.722"", ""10.1080/00963402.1959.11454030"", ""10.1080/00963402.1956.11453713"", ""10.1080/00963402.1960.11454123"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9997.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1905675"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226422657.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139026185"", ""10.1007/s11071-009-9530-z"", ""10.4159/9780674973053-003"", ""10.1086/255469"", ""10.1515/9780691217987"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226097206.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1905773"", ""10.2307/2234627"", ""10.2307/2009360"", ""10.1111/j.1752-5209.2007.00010.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511559990"", ""10.1086/258551"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226046778.001.0001"", ""10.1177/002200275700100301"", ""10.1515/9781400864898.81"", ""10.1057/9780230379435"", ""10.2307/20029443""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

The main sources are published legal decisions. I analyze the courts’ and economists’ discourses on the use of a specific method: multiple regression analysis in relation to litigation history, academic debates, and the institutional settings of expertise within the courts. I first show how the early reception of the method in the late 1970s did not involve systematic rejection from the courts but rather a large amount of skepticism. I then illustrate how economic theory underlying the method was progressively introduced in the “judicial tool kit” and how the debates in the courtrooms relate to the debates in academia in the 1980s. By 1989, practical and ethical questions regarding the institutional settings of experts’ testimony took center stage, reflecting the increasing professionalization of forensic economics.","[{""name"": ""Cléo Chassonnery-Zaïgouche"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1257/jep.13.2.101"", ""10.1111/j.1747-4469.2011.01277.x"", ""10.1162/posc_a_00484"", ""10.2307/144710"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-12371-1_12"", ""10.1080/01603477.1991.11489889"", ""10.1177/009102608101000405"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199211319.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1340295"", ""10.1111/j.1747-4469.1984.tb00900.x"", ""10.1080/01621459.1986.10478270"", ""10.1080/026917299298709"", ""10.2307/3053668"", ""10.2307/1288251"", ""10.1080/01621459.1982.10477885"", ""10.2307/3377770"", ""10.1215/00182702-4296305"", ""10.1017/S1053837209090208"", ""10.2307/1882010"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3567105"", ""10.1257/jep.29.1.89"", ""10.1214/ss/1177012895"", ""10.1080/01621459.1986.10478271"", ""10.2307/1340033"", ""10.1080/00213624.2005.11506825"", ""10.1007/978-1-4612-3604-7"", ""10.1215/00182702-2716127"", ""10.1186/s41937-017-0019-2"", ""10.1214/ss/1177012894"", ""10.1007/BF00128817"", ""10.1257/jel.20151296"", ""10.1215/00182702-2716100"", ""10.1215/00182702-2716100"", ""10.4159/9780674039681"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226092102.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-232X.1982.tb00240.x"", ""10.2307/144855"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226466996.001.0001"", ""10.1257/jep.3.1.43"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226041049.001.0001"", ""10.1086/422588"", ""10.1215/00182702-4166287"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-5636-0_3"", ""10.1215/00182702-2716136"", ""10.2307/2525981"", ""10.1257/jep.13.2.91"", ""10.1023/A:1006802628349"", ""10.1080/09672567.2016.1186205"", ""10.3233/JEM-2004-0226"", ""10.5040/9798216187721"", ""10.1515/9781400830893"", ""10.1215/00182702-4166239"", ""10.1080/09672567.2017.1415948"", ""10.2307/1339320"", ""10.1515/9780691216010"", ""10.1515/9781400829699"", ""10.1177/0162243916674322"", ""10.2307/1228893"", ""10.1257/jep.13.2.113"", ""10.2307/1880760"", ""10.1257/jel.20160995"", ""10.4159/9780674039124"", ""10.2307/1122462"", ""10.2307/3323358"", ""10.2307/1952319"", ""10.1086/231252"", ""10.2307/2095325"", ""10.2307/1122137"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226217062.001.0001"", ""10.1215/00182702-4166299"", ""10.2307/1122138"", ""10.9783/9780812292831"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316452035"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226189666.001.0001"", ""10.1016/0047-2727(73)90013-3""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

The original design is transformed into a “locked” design such that the circuit reveals its correct functionality only when it is “unlocked” with a secret sequence of bits—the key bit-string. However, strong attacks, especially the SAT attack that uses a SAT solver to recover the key bit-string, have been profoundly effective at breaking the locked circuit and recovering the circuit functionality.We lift logic locking to Higher Order Logic Locking (HOLL) by hiding a higher-order relation, instead of a key of independent values, challenging the attacker to discover this key relation to recreate the circuit functionality. Our technique uses program synthesis to construct the locked design and synthesize a corresponding key relation. HOLL has low overhead and existing attacks for logic locking do not apply as the entity to be recovered is no more a value. To evaluate our proposal, we propose a new attack (SynthAttack) that uses an inductive synthesis algorithm guided by an operational circuit as an input-output oracle to recover the hidden functionality. SynthAttack is inspired by the SAT attack, and similar to the SAT attack, it is verifiably correct, i.e., if the correct functionality is revealed, a verification check guarantees the same. Our empirical analysis shows that SynthAttack can break HOLL for small circuits and small key relations, but it is ineffective for real-life designs.","[{""name"": ""Gourav Takhar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ramesh Karri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian Pilato"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Subhajit Roy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3233/978-1-61499-495-4-1"", ""10.1145/3319535.3354246"", ""10.1145/3001854.3001860"", ""10.1145/2983990.2984014"", ""10.1109/ICCAD51958.2021.9643548"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_5"", ""10.1109/VLSI.Design.2010.54"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2020/226"", ""10.1109/DAC18072.2020.9218519"", ""10.1109/CGO.2013.6494983"", ""10.1017/S0960129520000109"", ""10.1109/FMCAD.2009.5351120"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41025-4_12"", ""10.14722/ndss.2015.23218"", ""10.1145/24039.24041"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-48288-9_7"", ""10.1145/1065010.1065036"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_31"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2021/261"", ""10.1109/ICCAD51958.2021.9643583"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2014.2332291"", ""10.1016/B978-075067944-2/50006-0"", ""10.1145/1806799.1806833"", ""10.1145/581339.581397"", ""10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2323976"", ""10.1145/2813885.2738002"", ""10.23919/DATE.2019.8714955"", ""10.1145/1065010.1065014"", ""10.1145/2462029.2462034"", ""10.1145/3293882.3330554"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54494-5_3"", ""10.1109/DAC.2018.8465830"", ""10.1109/SP40001.2021.00060"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38856-9_9"", ""10.1145/3236024.3236084"", ""10.1109/CGO.2009.11"", ""10.1145/3060403.3060494"", ""10.1145/3342099"", ""10.1109/HST.2019.8741035"", ""10.29007/2ndp"", ""10.23919/DATE.2019.8715163"", ""10.1145/3431389"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-10672-9_3"", ""10.1007/s10009-012-0249-7"", ""10.1109/HST.2015.7140252"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-16214-0_42"", ""10.1145/113445.113455"", ""10.1145/3368826.3377910"", ""10.1145/3106237.3106263"", ""10.1109/TETC.2017.2740364"", ""10.1145/3133956.3133985"", ""10.1145/3060403.3060492"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-39322-9_10""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Hardware and Architecture', 'Signal Processing']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7598), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7575)]]"

The keystone of SRV is the clean separation between temporal dependencies and data computations. However, in spite of this theoretical separation previous engines include hardwired implementations of just a few datatypes, requiring complex changes in the tool chain to incorporate new data types. Additionally, when previous tools implement features like parametrization these are implemented in an ad-hoc way. In contrast, is implemented as a Haskell embedded DSL, borrowing datatypes and functional aspects from Haskell, resulting in an extensible engine (The tool is available open-source athttp://github.com/imdea-software/hlola). We illustrate through several examples, including a UAV monitoring infrastructure with predictive characteristics that has been validated in online runtime verification in real mission planning.","[{""name"": ""Felipe Gorostiaga"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""César Sánchez"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-540-24622-0_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-77395-5_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-75632-5"", ""10.1145/2000799.2000800"", ""10.1007/3-540-36577-X_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-64437-6_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03044-5_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-45069-6_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03769-7_16"", ""10.1007/s10009-014-0309-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69149-5_40"", ""10.1007/3-540-46002-0_24"", ""10.1115/1.3662552"", ""10.1016/j.jlap.2008.08.004"", ""10.1007/978-1-4612-4222-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-85778-5_1"", ""10.1007/s10515-005-6205-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03769-7_9"", ""10.1016/S1571-0661(04)81051-X"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2004.01.026"", ""10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561671""]",['Computer Science'],"['Software', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

Recently, there has been a trend of increasing the expressive power of such logics by augmenting their rules with additional information to reason about program side-effects. For example, general program logics have been augmented with cost analyses, logics for probabilistic computations have been augmented with estimate measures, and logics for differential privacy with indistinguishability bounds. In this work, we unify these various approaches via the paradigm of grading, adapted from the world of functional calculi and semantics. We propose Graded Hoare Logic (GHL), a parameterisable framework for augmenting program logics with a preordered monoidal analysis. We develop a semantic framework for modelling GHL such that grading, logical assertions (pre- and post-conditions) and the underlying effectful semantics of an imperative language can be integrated together. Central to our framework is the notion of a graded category which we extend here, introducing graded Freyd categories which provide a semantics that can interpret many examples of augmented program logics from the literature. We leverage coherent fibrations to model the base assertion language, and thus the overall setting is also fibrational.","[{""name"": ""Marco Gaboardi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shin-ya Katsumata"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dominic Orchard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tetsuya Sato"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S095679680900728X"", ""10.1145/2933575.2934554"", ""10.1145/2676726.2677000"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2016.107"", ""10.1145/2492061"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_19"", ""10.1145/2737924.2737955"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139172707"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-1793-7_4"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49630-5_30"", ""10.1145/2951913.2951939"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-30936-1_7"", ""10.1109/LICS.2013.33"", ""10.1017/S0960129508007172"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2015.03.047"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.FSCD.2020.15"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2015.03.020"", ""10.1145/2535838.2535846"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89366-2_6"", ""10.23638/LMCS-14(4:6)2018"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45231-5_21"", ""10.1145/3341708"", ""10.1145/3371072"", ""10.1007/11874683_33"", ""10.1145/2676726.2676970"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.CALCO.2015.253"", ""10.1016/0890-5401(91)90052-4"", ""10.1007/11734727_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-27810-0_1"", ""10.1016/0167-6423(87)90029-3"", ""10.1145/3341714"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.317.2"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39212-2_35"", ""10.1145/2628136.2628160"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2006.08.006"", ""10.1007/BFb0014560"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2016.09.043"", ""10.1109/LICS.2019.8785668"", ""10.1007/s10958-008-9013-7"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2014.02.010"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54434-1_32"", ""10.1145/2429069.2429074"", ""10.1007/BFb0061362"", ""10.1112/plms/s3-72.2.281""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

These specialized genocide tribunals, in operation between 2002 and 2012, authorized laypersons to sentence their neighbors to up to life in prison. They passed judgment on almost two million cases, at an official conviction rate of 86 percent. I argue that through their practice, “genocide” came to be constituted as a crime whose contours extended far beyond the boundaries of any international legal definition. It included a wide range of acts, utterances, and inner states, as potentially infinite manifestations of a boundless criminal interiority named “genocide ideology,” the necessary ‘driving force’ behind acts of genocide. Within Gacaca, genocide ideology was constituted as thecontinuingdestructivepotentialof Hutu to menace or even disrespect innocent Tutsi, who were constituted as metonymic of the “new” state. The paranoid hermeneutics of those trials led them to project such an interiority within ‘others,’ imagined as constantly on the verge of erupting into insurrectionary violence, threatening the state's very foundation. The figure of the “Hutu” was transformed into a negative political category operating as a spectral threat haunting the New Rwanda. Gacaca led to a realization throughout the vast population that it marked as “Hutu” that the crime of genocide could potentially inhabit any and perhaps even all of them, thereby producing a generalized fear and pervasive silence.","[{""name"": ""Mark Anthony Geraghty"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3406/polaf.1990.5421"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511522291"", ""10.1525/9780520316638"", ""10.1111/j.1835-9310.2003.tb00229.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107338647"", ""10.1017/S0010417514000620"", ""10.1093/afraf/adh007"", ""10.1111/j.1747-4469.2001.tb00180.x"", ""10.9783/9780812292398"", ""10.1086/220754"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1nzfgd5"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316018804"", ""10.5040/9798216014577"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226277479.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226922089.001.0001"", ""10.1111/amet.12055"", ""10.9783/9780812205978"", ""10.1177/1750698018823233"", ""10.1215/9780822384786-005"", ""10.1515/9780804774635"", ""10.2307/466418"", ""10.1093/ijtj/ijm041""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

In Test-Comp 2021, we described a previous version that incrementally injected labels to guide Bounded Model Checking (BMC) and Evolutionary Fuzzing engines to produce test cases for code coverage and bug finding. This paper introduces an improved version of FuSeBMC that utilizes both engines to produce smart seeds. First, the engines run with a short time limit on a lightly instrumented version of the program to produce the seeds. The BMC engine is particularly useful in producing seeds that can pass through complex mathematical guards. Then, FuSeBMC runs its engines with extended time limits using the smart seeds created in the previous round. FuSeBMC manages this process in two main ways. Firstly, it uses shared memory to record the labels covered by each test case. Secondly, it evaluates test cases, and those of high impact are turned into seeds for subsequent test fuzzing. In this year’s competition, we participate in the Cover-Error, Cover-Branches, and Overall categories. The Test-Comp 2022 results show that we significantly increased our code coverage score from last year, outperforming all tools in all categories.","[{""name"": ""Kaled M.

10.1017/S0022050721000322,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC HISTORY,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,From Material to Non-Material Needs? The Evolution of Mate Preferences through the Twentieth Century in France,"This paper studies the evolution of mate preferences throughout the twentieth century in France. I digitized all the matrimonial ads published in France’s best-selling monthly magazine from 1928 to 1994. Using dictionary-based methods, I show that mate preferences were mostly stable during the Great Depression, WWII, and the ensuing economic boom. These preferences started transforming in the late 1960s when economic criteria were progressively replaced by personality criteria. The timing coincides with profound family and demographic changes in French society. These findings suggest that, in the search for a long-term partner, non-material needs have replaced material ones.","[{""name"": ""Quentin Lippmann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-6494.1997.tb00531.x"", ""10.1163/156853995X00135"", ""10.3917/rfs.512.0281"", ""10.1353/dem.2005.0036"", ""10.2307/1532737"", ""10.1111/roiw.12450"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.35.4.257"", ""10.1257/jep.21.2.27"", ""10.1257/aer.104.5.348"", ""10.3406/rhmc.1980.1099"", ""10.3917/rfs.553.0459"", ""10.2307/2095670"", ""10.1162/qjec.2006.121.2.673"", ""10.1177/0957926596007002003"", ""10.3917/rfs.593.0395"", ""10.1162/003355301753265589"", ""10.1177/0038038598032004009"", ""10.2307/2525981"", ""10.1353/jhr.2013.0010"", ""10.1257/aer.100.1.130"", ""10.1086/229786"", ""10.1186/2193-8997-1-3"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2009.09.004"", ""10.1086/704073"", ""10.3886/E132261V1"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7295.2011.00398.x"", ""10.1002/per.411"", ""10.1007/s00148-012-0413-0"", ""10.1257/jep.21.2.3"", ""10.2307/3321929"", ""10.1111/j.0022-2445.2004.00058.x"", ""10.3406/estat.2006.7116"", ""10.1086/677191"", ""10.1073/pnas.1420441111"", ""10.1177/0192513X13490404"", ""10.1086/702018"", ""10.1093/qje/qju018"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.395"", ""10.1111/j.1741-3737.2001.00491.x"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2017.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2018.01.012"", ""10.2307/144855"", ""10.1093/qje/qjr020"", ""10.1086/661778"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00023992"", ""10.2307/3321822""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Demography', 'Gender Studies', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"
10.1017/S001041752100044X,COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN SOCIETY AND HISTORY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,Francisco Franco Is Back: The Contested Reemergence of a Fascist Moral Exemplar,"AbstractBased on long-term ethnographic research on contemporary exhumations of mass graves from the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), as well as analysis of the exhumation of Francisco Franco from the Valley of the Fallen, this paper looks at the ways in which the dictator’s moral exemplarity has evolved over time since his military victory in 1939. During the early years of his dictatorship, Franco’s propaganda machine built the legend of a historical character touched by divine providence who sacrificed himself to save Spain from communism. His moral charisma was enriched by associating his historical mission with a constellation of moral exemplars drawn from medieval and imperial Spain. After his death, his moral exemplarity dwindled as democratic Spain embraced a political discourse of national reconciliation. Yet, since 2000, a new negative exemplarity of Franco as a war criminal has come into sharp focus, in connection with the exhumation of the mass graves of tens of thousands of Republican civilians executed by his army and paramilitary. In recent years, Franco has reemerged as a fascist exemplar alongside a rise of the extreme right. To understand the revival of his fascist exemplarity, I focus on two processes: the rise of the political party Vox, which claims undisguised admiration for Franco’s legacy (a process I call “neo-exemplarity”), and the dismantling in October 2019 of Franco’s honorable burial and the debate over the treatment that his mortal remains deserve (a process I call “necro-exemplarity”).","[{""name"": ""Francisco Ferrándiz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/amet.12004"", ""10.1086/701057"", ""10.1525/aa.2006.108.1.77"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1kmj7sx"", ""10.1080/13608746.2017.1395078"", ""10.1177/1750698014568247"", ""10.1525/rep.2015.129.1.116"", ""10.1080/21567689.2011.624408"", ""10.1080/14636204.2015.1135599"", ""10.9783/9780812291322-004"", ""10.1163/9789004352353_006"", ""10.1515/9781503602632""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Law']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Organisations including the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the International Refugee Organization (IRO), and eventually the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) placed refugee resettlement at the heart of constructing the postwar world order. This volume adopts a global optic to investigate the formation of this international resettlement regime in Europe and Asia, while also studying refugee camps and movements, agency of refugees and migrants, decision factors for resettlement, and the intellectual production of people on the move. A historicisation of the global resettlement regime of the long 1940s may well carry important political and ethical lessons for us today, if only to remind us of the connected fates of our common humanity, and the responsibilities we therefore bear towards our fellow human beings.","[{""name"": ""Milinda Banerjee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kerstin von Lingen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S1479244318000227"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtx052"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtq050"", ""10.1177/0022009408091835"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00017133"", ""10.1353/hum.2021.0000""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We find that counties with higher liberty bond ownership rates turned against the Democratic Party in the presidential elections of 1920 and 1924. This was a reaction to the depreciation of the bonds prior to the 1920 election (when the Democrats held the presidency) and the appreciation of the bonds in the early 1920s (under a Republican president), as the Federal Reserve raised and then subsequently lowered interest rates. Our analysis suggests that the liberty bond campaigns had unintended political consequences.","[{""name"": ""Eric Hilt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wendy Rahn"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2139/ssrn.3220430"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2718537"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2010.09.001"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674061217"", ""10.1515/9780691188270-008"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511586576"", ""10.1017/S0968565015000037"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674497764"", ""10.2307/1955049"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7295.2007.00083.x"", ""10.1515/9781400882731"", ""10.1073/pnas.0611071104"", ""10.1515/9781400829330"", ""10.1257/aer.20170237"", ""10.1017/S002205071800058X"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000440"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000314"", ""10.3886/E119103V1"", ""10.7758/rsf.2016.2.6.05"", ""10.1023/A:1005292312412"", ""10.1093/qje/qjv019""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Accounting', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

The Generational Progress of Mexican Americans Prior to World War II,"We present new estimates of the outcomes of first-generation Mexicans and their descendants between 1880 and 1940. We find zero convergence of the economic gap between Mexicans and non-Mexican whites across three generations. The great-grandchildren of immigrants also had fewer years of education. Slow convergence is not simply due to an inheritance of poverty; rather, Mexican Americans had worse outcomes conditional on the father’s economic status. However, the gap between third-generation Mexican Americans and non-Mexican whites is about half the size today as it was in 1940, suggesting that barriers to Mexican American progress have significantly decreased over time.","[{""name"": ""Edward Kosack"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zachary Ward"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3386/w26227"", ""10.1080/01615449909598923"", ""10.1086/675805"", ""10.1017/S0022050717000808"", ""10.1093/qje/qjz042"", ""10.1037/h0075521"", ""10.1093/qje/qjy006"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226066684.003.0002"", ""10.1037/h0059800"", ""10.1177/001979399404700403"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2019.101304"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000335"", ""10.1080/00224545.1934.9921591"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226066684.003.0008"", ""10.1080/01615440009598955"", ""10.1086/666383"", ""10.1257/app.20170382"", ""10.1111/j.0022-3840.1980.1303_564.x"", ""10.3886/E119302V1"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3138979"", ""10.2307/1051983"", ""10.1086/690944"", ""10.1080/00224545.1931.9918966"", ""10.3386/w26408"", ""10.1007/s001480050149"", ""10.3982/QE69"", ""10.1080/00221309.1928.9918018"", ""10.1093/qje/qjy007"", ""10.1086/658088"", ""10.2307/2118325"", ""10.1093/ereh/hez007"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2019.02.001"", ""10.5406/jamerethnhist.30.2.0033"", ""10.1017/ssh.2015.70"", ""10.1086/262045"", ""10.3386/w22748"", ""10.1006/exeh.2000.0746"", ""10.1086/676461"", ""10.1257/aeri.20190079"", ""10.1017/S0022050714000849"", ""10.3386/w26414"", ""10.1086/683668"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2019.101302"", ""10.3368/jhr.52.3.0715-7290R"", ""10.1017/S0898030616000257"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2014.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.labeco.2019.101771"", ""10.1177/0002716293530001006"", ""10.1086/701297"", ""10.2307/3595069"", ""10.1257/000282803321947263"", ""10.1086/499971"", ""10.1006/exeh.2000.0767"", ""10.1017/S0022050716000590""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We introduce the EduCOR ontology, an educational, career-oriented ontology that provides a foundation for representing online learning resources for personalised learning systems. The ontology is designed to enable learning material repositories to offer learning path recommendations, which correspond to the user’s learning goals and preferences, academic and psychological parameters, and labour-market skills. We present the multiple patterns that compose the EduCOR ontology, highlighting its cross-domain applicability and integrability with other ontologies. A demonstration of the proposed ontology on the real-life learning platform eDoer is discussed as a use case. We evaluate the EduCOR ontology using both gold standard and task-based approaches. The comparison of EduCOR to three gold schemata, and its application in two use-cases, shows its coverage and adaptability to multiple OER repositories, which allows generating user-centric and labour-market oriented recommendations.Resource: https://tibonto.github.io/educor/.","[{""name"": ""Eleni Ilkou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hasan Abu-Rasheed"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammadreza Tavakoli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sherzod Hakimov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gábor Kismihók"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sören Auer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wolfgang Nejdl"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3314183.3323463"", ""10.1609/aaai.v34i01.5395"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-62466-8_15"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2839607"", ""10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943018"", ""10.1186/s40561-020-00135-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95165-2_14"", ""10.1109/ICEIEC.2019.8784572"", ""10.1145/3132218.3132219"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3092315"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2944243"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-09868-5"", ""10.1007/s10796-009-9199-3"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103642"", ""10.1109/AICCSA.2017.150"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2889635"", ""10.5220/0009575104610468"", ""10.1145/3407982.3407989"", ""10.1109/ICIMTech.2017.8273544"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10508-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98192-5_11"", ""10.1177/0340035217737559"", ""10.23919/MIPRO.2019.8756685"", ""10.1016/j.future.2013.10.027"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10226-z"", ""10.1007/s10462-017-9539-5"", ""10.1109/ICALT49669.2020.00007"", ""10.1145/3448139.3448208"", ""10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274175"", ""10.1109/ICALT49669.2020.00008"", ""10.5220/0009420300960104"", ""10.1038/sdata.2016.18"", ""10.1109/CCWC51732.2021.9376163""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Science Applications', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

Globalization forces, most notably overseas migration, in combination with flexible and well-integrated labor markets—signified by strong regional convergence, falling skill differentials, and small urban-rural wage gaps—pushed up wages in Sweden.","[{""name"": ""Johan Ericsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jakob Molinder"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/ereh/hes015"", ""10.1111/ehr.12491"", ""10.1524/jbwg.2000.41.1.61"", ""10.1086/701682"", ""10.1093/wbro/12.2.117"", ""10.1080/03585522.1997.10414666"", ""10.1093/ereh/heu003"", ""10.3886/E117441V1"", ""10.1080/03585520802191282"", ""10.1006/exeh.2001.0775"", ""10.1017/S0022050700019537"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2004.03.002"", ""10.1006/exeh.1995.1006"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3310.001.0001"", ""10.1086/498123"", ""10.1108/S0363-326820140000030000"", ""10.1017/S0022050700096418"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2012.00663.x"", ""10.1080/03585522.1955.10411470"", ""10.2307/jj.919480"", ""10.1080/03585522.1995.10415900"", ""10.1080/03071028708567680"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3128189"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000712"", ""10.1111/ehr.12661"", ""10.1093/ej/uez017"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2013.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2010.07.001"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.12032"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77j93"", ""10.1257/jep.29.1.3"", ""10.1017/S0022050719000354"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.12049"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9957.1954.tb00021.x"", ""10.1111/ehr.12743"", ""10.4054/DemRes.2014.30.17"", ""10.1093/ereh/heu022"", ""10.1080/03585522.2012.727764"", ""10.1162/003355300555042"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2009.04.004""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Public Administration']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

They represent a wide spectrum of type-systems for concurrency. Their type safety is thus extremely important. EMTST is a tool to aid in representing and validating theorems about session types in the Coq proof assistant. On paper, these proofs are often tricky, and error prone. In proof assistants, they are typically long and difficult to prove. In this work, we propose a library that helps validate the theory of session types calculi in proof assistants. As a case study, we study two of the most used binary session types systems: we show the impossibility of representing the first system in $$\alpha $$-equivalent representations, and we prove type preservation for the revisited system. We develop our tool in the Coq proof assistant, using locally nameless for binders and small scale reflection to simplify the handling of linear typing environments.","[{""name"": ""David Castro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Francisco Ferreira"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nobuko Yoshida"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/1328438.1328443"", ""10.1007/s10817-011-9225-2"", ""10.1007/s00236-005-0177-z"", ""10.1007/3-540-57826-9_152"", ""10.1017/S0960129514000231"", ""10.1007/3-540-57208-2_35"", ""10.1007/BFb0053567"", ""10.1145/1328438.1328472"", ""10.1145/1017472.1017477"", ""10.1023/A:1006294005493"", ""10.1016/0890-5401(92)90009-5"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54434-1_34"", ""10.1145/3354166.3354184"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2007.02.056""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Using the Most Similar Systems Design, this article explores the factors that influence the (divergent) citizenship regimes of Abkhazia and Transnistria; the former allows dual citizenship only with Russia, while the latter places no restrictions. The primary reason for the adoption of dual citizenship is for pragmatic reasons, as the secondary citizenship can compensate for the lack of benefits (such as international travel, diplomatic protection) afforded by thede factostate’s citizenship. This said, having an ethnicized national identity, in contrast to a civic (state-centered) national identity, can produce (dual) citizenship laws that give preferential treatment to the titular group and its diaspora. Additionally, the influence exerted by the patron state (Russia) and the severity of the conflict with the parent state (Georgia/Moldova) influences dual citizenship in becoming conditional and thus more exclusive.","[{""name"": ""Ramesh Ganohariti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511558764"", ""10.1177/019791839202600205"", ""10.1080/13621025.2011.600090"", ""10.1080/10758216.2017.1329630"", ""10.1080/13691831003764375"", ""10.1080/00905992.2011.599377"", ""10.1111/j.1475-682X.2008.00221.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.34.040507.134608"", ""10.1017/S1537592706060294"", ""10.1177/001041407500800202"", ""10.4324/9780203834510"", ""10.7910/DVN/TTMZ08"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52467-2"", ""10.1080/00905990801934371"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1440486"", ""10.1093/iclq/50.4.849"", ""10.1177/0022343306068102"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8322.2010.00721.x"", ""10.1353/kri.2003.0027"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.05.032"", ""10.1080/09668130903134848"", ""10.1080/13621025.2012.683214"", ""10.1163/9789047403180_005""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

What makes it different from other tools is that the memory model is not hard-coded inside Dartagnanbut taken as part of the input. For SV-COMP’20, we take as input sequential consistency (i.e. the standard interleaving memory model) extended by support for atomic blocks. Our point is to demonstrate that a universal tool can be competitive and perform well in SV-COMP. Being a bounded model checker, Dartagnan’s focus is on disproving safety properties by finding counterexample executions. For programs with bounded loops, Dartagnanperforms an iterative unwinding that results in a complete analysis. The SV-COMP’20 version of Dartagnanworks on Boogiecode.

10.1017/S1053837221000602,JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF ECONOMIC THOUGHT,0603 World History,DOES FRIENDSHIP STEM FROM ALTRUISM? ADAM SMITH AND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LOVE-BASED AND INTEREST-BASED PREFERENCES,"Friendship-and-love expresses musings about well-being—while the object of the musings, i.e., “well-being,” is the economist’s substantive satisfaction. Insofar as altruism is about well-being and not the musings, it cannot be subsumed under friendship-and-love. However, what is the basis of the difference between the economist’s substantive satisfaction and friendship-and-love? The answer can be found in Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments, chapter 2: how “mutual sympathy” differs from substantive satisfaction. Smith scholars generally miss the uniqueness of “mutual sympathy” and, indeed, fold it under Smith’s “sympathy” (and “empathy”)—with one exception. Robert Sugden highlights the uniqueness of mutual sympathy. However, he goes to the other end, that is, he folds Smith’s sympathy-and-empathy under mutual sympathy. This paper aims to avoid the folding in either direction. Indeed, it argues that each fellow-feeling deals with a question that is orthogonal to the other. Mutual sympathy originates love-based sociality (friendship-and-love), which can be juxtaposed to interest-based sociality, i.e., substantive satisfaction, such as altruism. These genera of sociality are about the nature of satisfaction or preferences, and hence in contrast to sympathy-and-empathy that are basically about judgments. As judgments, sympathy-and-empathy are ultimately about the nature of decision making, irrespective of whether the decisions concerning love-based or interest-based preferences.","[{""name"": ""Elias L.

As a formal verification approach, it is applied to critical systems; thus we trust that probabilistic model checkers deliver correct results. To achieve scalability and performance, however, these tools use finite-precision floating-point numbers to represent and calculate probabilities and other values. As a consequence, their results are affected by rounding errors that may accumulate and interact in hard-to-predict ways. In this paper, we show how to implement fast and correct probabilistic model checking by exploiting the ability of current hardware to control the direction of rounding in floating-point calculations. We outline the complications in achieving correct rounding from higher-level programming languages, describe our implementation as part of the Modest Toolset’s model checker, and exemplify the tradeoffs between performance and correctness in an extensive experimental evaluation across different operating systems and CPU architectures.","[{""name"": ""Arnd Hartmanns"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_8"", ""10.1007/3-540-60692-0_70"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11936-6_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-83723-5_15"", ""10.1137/1.9781611973082.101"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69850-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-21455-4_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11439-2_10"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2016.12.003"", ""10.1007/s10703-012-0167-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-06410-9_22"", ""10.1007/BF01211866"", ""10.4121/19074047"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_51"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17462-0_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_47"", ""10.1007/s10703-006-0005-2"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(01)00046-9"", ""10.1002/9780470316887"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_37"", ""10.3182/20090916-3-ES-3003.00029"", ""10.1109/DDECS.2008.4538787""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

Du Bois, the United Nations, and the Politics of Space and Scale","This article examines W. E. B. Du Bois's transnational political thought during his work with the UN and the NAACP in the 1940s. Focusing on unpublished speeches, essays, and correspondence, it explores how he exploited the conceptual elasticity of terms like “colonial status” and “colonial peoples” in order to build a transnational majority on a global scale. The conceptual capaciousness of the term “colony” and its cognates allowed him to connect disparate forms of domination and dependence across boundaries of race, nation, and empire, thus binding colonial and semicolonial peoples together in a common program of international action. The fruition of these efforts, I argue, was Du Bois's 1948 petition to the UN, An Appeal to the World. Through the appropriation of international legal discourse, he sought to politicize the jurisdictional bifurcation of domestic and international politics embedded in the UN Charter and expand the spatial scale of democracy by placing civil rights struggles in imperial context.","[{""name"": ""Adam Dahl"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2291869"", ""10.1177/030639689403600105"", ""10.1215/1089201X-8747581"", ""10.1017/S0018246X04003723"", ""10.1177/00905917211009152"", ""10.1086/699754"", ""10.1017/S1537592717000901"", ""10.1007/s12111-009-9104-7"", ""10.1017/S1537592712001636"", ""10.1525/curh.1935.42.3.265"", ""10.1017/S0018246X20000254"", ""10.1177/0090591710366380"", ""10.1111/1468-0130.00252"", ""10.1177/0090591718780697"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000601"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000994""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

On the other hand, the behavior of system features (e.g., operating systems) and the external world (e.g., communication between components) is usually specified using first-order formalisms. In principle, the soundness theorem of a separation logic is its interface with first-order theorems, but the soundness theorem may implicitly make assumptions about how other components are specified, limiting its use. In this paper, we show how to extend the higher-order separation logic of the Verified Software Toolchain to interface with a first-order verified operating system, in this case CertiKOS, that mediates its interaction with the outside world. The resulting system allows us to prove the correctness of C programs in separation logic based on the semantics of system calls implemented in CertiKOS. It also demonstrates that the combination of interaction trees + CompCert memories serves well as a lingua franca to interface and compose two quite different styles of program verification.","[{""name"": ""William Mansky"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wolf Honoré"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrew W.

Mutability requires strong updates to model changing invariants during program execution, but aliasing between pointers makes it difficult to determine which invariants must be updated in response to mutation. Our type system addresses this difficulty with a novel combination of refinement types and fractional ownership types. Fractional ownership types provide flow-sensitive and precise aliasing information for reference variables. ConSORT interprets this ownership information to soundly handle strong updates of potentially aliased references. We have proved ConSORT sound and implemented a prototype, fully automated inference tool.

It evaluates the impact of the pandemic on various aspects of the daily lives of the inhabitants and institutions of both parts of this divided town. Three main dimensions of cross-border integration were studied: cross-border flows, cross-border structures/institutions, and the feeling of togetherness, which represents an ideational dimension of cross-border integration. The research was based on studying narratives covering border closures in the divided town, the analysis of cross-borderness of existing Facebook groups acting in both parts of the divided town, and the results of an extensive questionnaire-based survey among its inhabitants. The border closures restricted cross-border flows, which hit cross-border commuters and damaged the quality of this divided town as a living place because it introduced uncertainty. However, the health crisis also showed the high level of mutual interconnections between the local inhabitants and a functional cross-border civic society. The local people and politicians tend to perceive the divided town as a joint living space.

Rumi Vodka, Persianate Ideals, and the Anthropology of Islam","AbstractShahab Ahmed’sWhat Is Islam? The Importance of Being Islamic(2016) challenges Islamic Studies scholars, (art) historians, and anthropologists to reconsider theoretical frameworks underpinning historical and ethnographic research. This article addresses Ahmed’s concerns that studies of Islam often conceptually privilege orthodoxy, by including drinking and intoxication as worthy of close attention in examining the history and the anthropology of Islam. The case of Wine Shop the Philosopher, run by a former Afghan refugee in The Hague and Amsterdam, is presented after establishing the comparative and interdisciplinary relevance of alcohol consumption in studies of Islam and Muslims. Ahmed’s conceptual framework is used and assessed in comparison with the wine shops’ contemporary pluralist reality by exploring the idealized boundaries of Persianate culture and Islam in dialogues between Persian-speaking interlocutors. It is argued that alcoholic drinks lend themselves to competing gastro-nationalisms and prompt ethnolinguistic tensions between and within groups with Turkish, Moroccan, Iranian, and Afghan backgrounds in the Netherlands. The focus on diverse, coexisting and clashing drink regimes, in conclusion, allows us to deconstruct dichotomies between sober Muslims and European drinkers, African and Asian believers and European unbelievers, and refugees and citizens.","[{""name"": ""Pooyan Tamimi Arab"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9781400832606"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511980015"", ""10.1163/15685195-0002A0002"", ""10.5040/9798400671340"", ""10.1525/9780520950276"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1435993"", ""10.5040/9781350044845"", ""10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.103484"", ""10.4324/9780203381304"", ""10.1215/1089201X-8186247"", ""10.1163/25898566-00901009"", ""10.14318/hau5.2.006"", ""10.1163/24682470-12340014"", ""10.1086/200597"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtt031"", ""10.5250/quiparle.17.2.1"", ""10.1016/S0271-5309(03)00010-7"", ""10.1163/2212-5019_BEH_COM_9000000012"", ""10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123120"", ""10.1080/00210860802518327"", ""10.2307/1357726"", ""10.1163/9789401210096"", ""10.1080/17432200.2019.1572360"", ""10.1515/9783110199109"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139045988"", ""10.2307/j.ctvxkn64g"", ""10.1515/9780748644575"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1vw0ps2.15"", ""10.1353/anq.0.0024"", ""10.2752/9781474235303"", ""10.1017/9781108622967"", ""10.1017/S0010417520000328"", ""10.1080/00207590801888752"", ""10.1525/ae.1981.8.3.02a00050"", ""10.1215/08992363-2007-004"", ""10.1111/j.1360-0443.1990.tb01688.x"", ""10.1007/s10943-015-0064-z"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9655.2009.01540.x"", ""10.1177/1879366518814668"", ""10.4000/acrh.5992"", ""10.2752/175183412X13415044208871"", ""10.1177/1359183521997503"", ""10.1057/9780230305076"", ""10.1215/08992363-18-1-111"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-092611-145823"", ""10.1177/009145090603300401"", ""10.5040/9781474291460"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226289663.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09571260500053541"", ""10.1525/9780520972100"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511521102"", ""10.4324/9780080458038"", ""10.1515/islam.2011.015"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96041-8""]","['Social Sciences', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Food Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

10.1017/S0018246X21000492,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,"Black Women's Groups, Life Narratives, and the Construction of the Self in Late Twentieth-Century Britain","AbstractBlack British women's centres and groups evolved out of black women's combined exclusion from male-dominated anti-racist activism and the resurgent feminist movement of the late 1960s. And yet, despite their stable presence in many of Britain's inner cities, black women's centres and groups, and the lives of the women who forged them, have evaded historical interrogation. This article explores how black women's centres provided women with the space and time to nurture their personal experiences of sexism and racism, achieve a sense of self-sufficiency, and celebrate their heritage, which placed every member on a path towards self-discovery. This centring of the black female self was not, as black male activists believed, set on undermining the Black liberation movement, but was considered as a vital tool in the overarching mission to defeat white global supremacy. Drawing on a collection of oral history interviews, this article explores how black female activists constructed a sense of self that turned away from the homogenizing white gaze of post-war Britain. Teasing out the complexities around black female activism, selfhood, and memory, this article contributes substantially to the growing body of literature on late twentieth-century black British history.","[{""name"": ""Jessica White"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/ohr/ohy030"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190240202.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14780038.2018.1551273"", ""10.1525/california/9780520293847.001.0001"", ""10.1215/-6-1-133"", ""10.1080/00064246.2016.1147937"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190658847.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09612025.2018.1472896"", ""10.1177/007327530404200204"", ""10.1080/13613324.2017.1365055"", ""10.1080/03071022.2013.872904"", ""10.4324/9780203849033"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511753213"", ""10.1177/0306396816643040"", ""10.1177/S0038038500000328"", ""10.1017/ssh.2015.82"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2014.03.006"", ""10.1080/13613324.2012.733685"", ""10.1057/fr.1988.42"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwv030"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbz055"", ""10.1080/09612020601049652"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwz011"", ""10.1080/13619462.2018.1434001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The Dafny toolchain provides a verifier that can prove an implementation of a method satisfies its specification. When the underlying SMT solver cannot establish a proof, it generates a counterexample. These counterexamples are hard to understand and their interpretation is often a bottleneck in the proof debugging process. In this paper, we introduce an open-source tool that transforms counterexamples generated by the SMT solver to a more user-friendly format that maps to the Dafny syntax and is suitable for further processing. This new tool allows the Dafny developers to quickly identify the root cause of a problem with their proof, thereby speeding up the development of Dafny projects.","[{""name"": ""Aleksandar Chakarov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aleksandr Fedchin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zvonimir Rakamarić"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Neha Rungta"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/11804192_17"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.338.10"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5571033"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_3"", ""10.1016/j.jlamp.2018.05.003"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-24690-6_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-17511-4_20"", ""10.1109/MS.2017.4121212"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1109/ISSRE52982.2021.00032""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"
10.1017/mit.2021.30,MODERN ITALY,0603 World History; 0705 Geography,"Amnesia, aphasia and amnesty: the articulations of Italian colonial memory in postwar films (1946-1960)","This article aims to expose the political and cultural processes that contributed to the eradication of problematic memories of the Italian colonial period during the national reconstruction following the Second World War. It offers a systematic examination of newsreels and documentaries about the Italian former colonies that were produced between 1946 and 1960, a film corpus that has largely been neglected by previous scholarship. The article first dissects the ambiguous political scenario that characterised the production of this footage through the study of original archival findings. The footage configured a particular form of self-exculpatory memory, which obstructed a thorough critique of the colonial period while articulating a new discourse about the future presence of Italy in the former colonies. This seems to be a case of aphasia rather than amnesia, insofar as the films addressed not an absence, but an inability to comprehend and articulate a critical discourse about the past. This aphasic configuration of colonial memories will be tackled through a close reading of the voice-over and commentary.

They can be found in a variety of form factors and are increasingly important in our daily lives. As such, ensuring that these systems are equitable to different subgroups of the population is crucial. In this paper, we introduce,AequeVox, an automated testing framework for evaluating the fairness of ASR systems.AequeVoxsimulates different environments to assess the effectiveness of ASR systems for different populations. In addition, we investigate whether the chosen simulations are comprehensible to humans. We further propose a fault localization technique capable of identifying words that are not robust to these varying environments. Both components ofAequeVoxare able to operate in the absence of ground truth data.We evaluateAequeVoxon speech from four different datasets using three different commercial ASRs. Our experiments reveal that non-native English, female and Nigerian English speakers generate109%,528.5%and156.9%more errors, on average than native English, male and UK Midlands speakers, respectively. Our user study also reveals that 82.9% of the simulations (employed through speech transformations) had a comprehensibility rating above seven (out of ten), with the lowest rating being 6.78. This further validates the fairness violations discovered byAequeVox. Finally, we show that the non-robust words, as predicted by the fault localization technique embodied inAequeVox, show223.8%more errors than the predicted robust words across all ASRs.","[{""name"": ""Sai Sathiesh Rajan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sakshi Udeshi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sudipta Chattopadhyay"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3338906.3338937"", ""10.1109/ICSME46990.2020.00066"", ""10.1145/3377930.3389827"", ""10.1109/SPW.2018.00009"", ""10.1109/SP40001.2021.00004"", ""10.1145/2090236.2090255"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16722-6_10"", ""10.1145/3395363.3397357"", ""10.1145/3106237.3106277"", ""10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.05.005"", ""10.1145/3324884.3416571"", ""10.1177/030802260206500104"", ""10.1109/DASC.2016.7778024"", ""10.21437/Eurospeech.2001-356"", ""10.1109/ICST.2019.00012"", ""10.21437/Interspeech.2018-1864"", ""10.4249/scholarpedia.2088"", ""10.1073/pnas.1915768117"", ""10.1109/DASC.2013.6719700"", ""10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462693"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0196391"", ""10.1145/3238147.3238202"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2020/64"", ""10.1145/3132747.3132785"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2004.00188.x"", ""10.1145/2939672.2939778"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11491"", ""10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.442"", ""10.1109/ICMLA52953.2021.00123"", ""10.1109/ICST.2019.00022"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-64881-7_16"", ""10.1145/3395363.3397352"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58604-1_24"", ""10.1145/3238147.3238172"", ""10.1145/3180155.3180220"", ""10.1145/3238147.3238165"", ""10.1145/3194770.3194776"", ""10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00038"", ""10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00034"", ""10.1163/9789401206884_014"", ""10.1145/3293882.3330579"", ""10.1109/TR.2020.2972266"", ""10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00129""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

This article argues that institutional dynamics of American higher education played a decisive role in the creation of this divide. Through quantitative analysis of the hiring and promotion of philosophers, it demonstrates how hierarchies and informal academic networks established boundaries for mainstream American philosophy that excluded modern European thought. Following the end of World War II, as American universities expanded, philosophy departments nearly tripled in size. However, the discipline was dominated by a Brahmin caste of elite departments that hired its own graduates almost exclusively. In this environment, the invidious distinction between the “elite” analytic departments and heterodox departments at the discipline's periphery was mapped onto the styles of philosophy practiced at those schools, and shaped America's reception of “Continental” European philosophy.","[{""name"": ""JONATHAN STRASSFELD"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.56021/9780801870378"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226066493.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2103073"", ""10.1063/1.3048413"", ""10.2307/2022299"", ""10.1086/287167"", ""10.1086/287127"", ""10.2307/2021620"", ""10.2307/1397430"", ""10.2307/2102893"", ""10.1080/01916599.2015.1118330"", ""10.2307/2108030"", ""10.1017/S0031819100007762"", ""10.2307/2102737"", ""10.1111/1467-9973.00274"", ""10.2307/2105885"", ""10.2307/2102968"", ""10.1017/S0018246X13000095"", ""10.9783/9781512817263"", ""10.2307/2102949"", ""10.2307/2021568"", ""10.2307/2182593""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['History', 'Philosophy', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

We claim that this intersection stems from more than just vested interest fuelling advocacy groups. By focusing on the intellectual developments and social networks of core actors in the environmental debate in Sweden, we trace the history of opposition to environmental regulation in a country proclaiming to be an environmental pioneer. Our analysis shows that while the framing of climate change in terms of complexity initially provided actors with arguments for neoliberal policies, the obstruction of climate and environmental action was steeped in a neoliberal thought style. Our findings demonstrate the importance of scrutinising economic paradigms and thought styles that has enabled the delay of climate policy as well as the continued need for historical and geographically specific studies of obstruction.","[{""name"": ""Kristoffer Ekberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Victor Pressfeldt"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Environmental Science', 'Energy', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

With the advent of SMT solvers, it has been successfully applied to LLVM code (to reduce the number of instructions) and to Ethereum EVM bytecode (to reduce its gas consumption). Both applications, when proven practical, have left out memory operations and thus missed important optimization opportunities. A main challenge to superoptimization today is handling memory operations while remaining scalable.

Nevertheless, women were actively involved in the early stages of silver mining in Potosí, when traditional technologies were still in use. They also played an important role in the local ore market. After the introduction of new technology and the reorganization of the labour force, the process of refining ore was much more complicated. Women then participated in some stages of the process: in selecting the ores and sieving. This implies that mining is a complex process with a labour and gender division that has been underrated and underestimated. More importantly, women became owners of rudimentary mills (trapiches) where the ore was processed, selling different amounts of silver to the Spanish authorities, making their living in this way.","[{""name"": ""Rossana Barragán Romano"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1478-0542.2009.00658.x"", ""10.4067/S0718-10432014000200005"", ""10.1215/9780822386667"", ""10.2307/j.ctv62hdhw.10"", ""10.1163/9789004336391_007"", ""10.1215/00141801-3455347"", ""10.1093/past/93.1.98"", ""10.1111/dech.12115"", ""10.7788/jbla-1977-0104"", ""10.4067/S0718-68942010000200003"", ""10.1215/00182168-1902778"", ""10.1080/01436597.2013.800751""]",['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Yet, when employees do not follow security rules, many security practitioners attribute this to them being “weak” or “careless”; many employees in turn hide current practices or planned development because they see security as “killjoys” who “come and kill our baby”. Negative language and blaming others for problems are indicators of dysfunctional relationships. We collected a small set of statements from security experts’ about employees to gauge how widespread this blaming is. To understand how employees view IT security staff, we performed a prolific survey with 100 employees (n = 92) from the US &amp; UK, asking them about their perceptions of, and emotions towards, IT security staff. Our findings indicate that security relationships are indeed often dysfunctional. Psychology offers frameworks for identifying relationship and communication flows that are dysfunctional, and a range of interventions for transforming them into functional ones. We present common examples of dysfunctionality, show how organisations can apply those interventions to rebuild trust and collaboration, and establish a positive approach to security in organisations that seizes human potential instead of blaming the human element. We propose Transactional Analysis (TA) and the OLaF questionnaire as measurement tools to assess how organisations deal with error, blame and guilt. We continue to consider possible interventions inspired by therapy such as conditions from individual and group therapy which can be implemented, for example, in security dialogues or the use of humour and clowns.","[{""name"": ""Uta Menges"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jonas Hielscher"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Annalina Buckmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Annette Kluge"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M.

Although the outbreak was far less severe than the 1918–19 ‘Spanish’ influenza pandemic, the ease with which influenza spread globally between 1968 and 1970 contributed to a reformulation of global health that emphasized the need for enhanced preparedness and rapid vaccine production. From the 1950s through the 1960s, the scope of disease surveillance expanded, with China increasingly identified as the global epicentre of viral threats. In so arguing, the article challenges histories of global health that suggest that this was a period when concerns for infectious disease receded, in contrast to the final two decades of the twentieth century that saw the ascendancy of an ‘emerging diseases worldview’.","[{""name"": ""Robert Peckham"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['History and Philosophy of Science'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

This way, information about program traces and variable assignments can be shared across tools, e.g., to validate verification results, or provided to users, e.g., to visualize and explore the results in order to fix bugs or understand the reason for a program’s correctness. The standard format for correctness and violation witnesses that was used by SV-COMP for several years was only applicable to sequential (single-threaded) programs. To enable the validation of results for multi-threaded programs, we extend the existing standard exchange format by adding information about thread management and thread interleaving. We contribute a reference implementation of a validator for violation witnesses in the new format, which we implemented as component of the software-verification framework ""Image missing"" . We experimentally evaluate the format and validator on a large set of violation witnesses. The outcome is promising: several verification tools already produce violation witnesses that help validating the verification results, and our witness validator can re-verify most of the produced witnesses.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karlheinz Friedberger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-71734-0_2"", ""10.1109/COMPSAC.2007.236"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_55"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21"", ""10.5281/zenodo.3633334"", ""10.5281/zenodo.3630188"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950351"", ""10.1145/2786805.2786867"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92994-1_1"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.233.6"", ""10.5281/zenodo.3885694"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73368-3_51"", ""10.1109/ASE.2008.13"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16"", ""10.1145/3238147.3240478"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-37057-1_11"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1007/s10009-014-0334-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39176-7_1"", ""10.1007/3-540-45848-4_59"", ""10.1145/1180405.1180445"", ""10.1109/ASE.2017.8115633"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24730-2_15"", ""10.1145/1062455.1062533"", ""10.1145/3121257.3121262"", ""10.1007/s10009-015-0407-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03592-1_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66706-5_7"", ""10.1007/3-540-49059-0_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_29"", ""10.1145/3332466.3374529"", ""10.1109/TSE.2018.2864122""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

Fairness and other ethical issues are often one of the main concerns in decision making. In this work, we define a formal framework for the fairness verification and analysis of quantum machine learning decision models, where we adopt one of the most popular notions of fairness in the literature based on the intuition—any two similar individuals must be treated similarly and are thus unbiased. We show that quantum noise can improve fairness and develop an algorithm to check whether a (noisy) quantum machine learning model is fair. In particular, this algorithm can find bias kernels of quantum data (encoding individuals) during checking.

Here traces collect, for instance, the externally observable events of each execution. This definition requires, however, the set of traces of the source and target languages to be exactly the same, which is not the case when the languages are far apart or when observations are fine-grained. To overcome this issue, we study a generalized compiler correctness definition, which uses source and target traces drawn from potentially different sets and connected by an arbitrary relation. We set out to understand what guarantees this generalized compiler correctness definition gives us when instantiated with a non-trivial relation on traces. When this trace relation is not equality, it is no longer possible to preserve the trace properties of the source program unchanged. Instead, we provide a generic characterization of the target trace property ensured by correctly compiling a program that satisfies a given source property, and dually, of the source trace property one is required to show in order to obtain a certain target property for the compiled code. We show that this view on compiler correctness can naturally account for undefined behavior, resource exhaustion, different source and target values, side-channels, and various abstraction mismatches. Finally, we show that the same generalization also applies to many secure compilation definitions, which characterize the protection of a compiled program against linked adversarial code.","[{""name"": ""Carmine Abate"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roberto Blanco"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ștefan Ciobâcă"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adrien Durier"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Deepak Garg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cătălin Hrițcu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marco Patrignani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Éric Tanter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jérémy Thibault"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/292540.292555"", ""10.1109/CSF.2019.00025"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2003.06.002"", ""10.1109/CSF.2018.00031"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_7"", ""10.1007/s10817-017-9439-z"", ""10.1007/s10817-014-9317-x"", ""10.1007/s10817-018-9457-5"", ""10.1145/2594291.2594301"", ""10.3233/JCS-2009-0393"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(00)00313-3"", ""10.1145/512950.512973"", ""10.1109/SPW.2015.33"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(85)90028-3"", ""10.3233/JCS-1994/1995-3103"", ""10.1016/0167-6423(94)90006-X"", ""10.1145/3175660"", ""10.1109/SP.1982.10014"", ""10.1145/3192366.3192381"", ""10.1145/2976749.2978405"", ""10.1145/1926385.1926402"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-31987-0_29"", ""10.1145/2737924.2738005"", ""10.1145/2837614.2837642"", ""10.1145/1538788.1538814"", ""10.1007/s10817-009-9155-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99725-4_17"", ""10.1090/psapm/019/0242403"", ""10.1007/3-540-17162-2_130"", ""10.1145/512927.512941"", ""10.1145/2908080.2908109"", ""10.1017/S0960129598002552"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31038-7_3"", ""10.1145/2784731.2784764"", ""10.1016/j.cl.2015.03.002"", ""10.1109/CSF.2017.13"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17184-1_17"", ""10.1145/3341689"", ""10.1145/2676724.2693167"", ""10.1145/267959.269968"", ""10.1145/2487241.2487248"", ""10.1145/2676726.2676985"", ""10.1017/S0956796818000229"", ""10.1145/2349896.2349905"", ""10.1145/2517349.2522728"", ""10.1145/3290375"", ""10.1145/3371119"", ""10.1145/2103656.2103709""]","['Computer Science', 'Materials Science']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Materials Chemistry']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

10.1017/S0010417522000068,COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN SOCIETY AND HISTORY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,The Sufi and the Sickle: Theorizing Mystical Marxism in Rural Pakistan,"AbstractIn worlds of difference, how might certain unities be forged for liberation? This paper pursues this question from the vantage-point of the dialectical tension between Marxism and religion. While some scholars have noted parallels between the two, philosophers of critical realism have aimed to establish a deeper equivalence between Marxism and religion. This paper, however, considers how an equivalence may be forged by subaltern actors in the context of political struggles—how a religious Marxism might look as a theoretical and political practice. I do this by historically reconstructing the life of Sufi Sibghatullah Mazari, a locally influential communist from Pakistan who equated Sufism with Mao-inflected Marxism. Born into a poor farming family from South Punjab, he would go on to lead peasant movements against “feudal” landlords (jagirdars) during the 1970s and be recruited into the Mazdoor Kisan Party, the country’s historically largest communist party, which drew inspiration from Mao Tse-tung. Sibghatullah’s introduction to Maoist thought and practice, especially its emphasis on a vernacular-driven communist universalism, led him to comparatively reflect on circulating insurgent Sufisms and their own universalist possibilities. Maoism and Sufism’s shared universalist elements then allowed him to equate the two: an equivalence he centered on the concept of Truth (Haqiqat). Sibghatullah also expressed this “mystical Marxism” in his political practice, as he mentored revolutionary Sufi disciples, recruited Sufi-inflected mullahs into the communist party, built alternative insurgent mosques, and even challenged the tribal and patriarchal “honor” codes, practices that, in undermining landlordism’s hegemony over Islam, threatened its reproduction.","[{""name"": ""Shozab Raza"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511973062"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004167711.i-478"", ""10.1525/9780520967823"", ""10.1017/S1479244318000215"", ""10.1017/9781108693875"", ""10.5149/9780807869864_shaikh"", ""10.4324/9780203245941"", ""10.1080/19472498.2013.824682"", ""10.1111/joac.12338"", ""10.1080/03085147.2013.783662"", ""10.1017/S0010417500013165"", ""10.1111/anti.12661"", ""10.4324/9780203879849"", ""10.1080/03056240701340415"", ""10.1177/009770048300900202"", ""10.1215/01642472-2009-072"", ""10.1080/03066157608437978""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Even though Portugal was not a principal actor in the discussion of colonial redistribution, the Portuguese empire was placed at the centre of these debates as a subject to be discussed. The article demonstrates that the great powers’ perception of Portugal as an inadequate colonial power was central to their strategy of colonial redistribution in an international context that espoused guarantees of territorial integrity to great and small states alike. In addition, it shows how Portugal entered the debate on colonial appeasement to promote a rhetoric of victimisation and bolster support for the dictatorship.","[{""name"": ""Márcia Gonçalves"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09592290802345001"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_611253"", ""10.2307/20028774"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-15803-4"", ""10.1017/S0018246X16000534"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190907211.003.0002"", ""10.1215/9780822380955"", ""10.2307/jj.4256613"", ""10.1057/9780230319325_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-60693-4_4"", ""10.1080/09592290802344962"", ""10.4324/9780203505786"", ""10.1017/S0018246X00005914"", ""10.3406/outre.2002.3996"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719091803.003.0003"", ""10.1057/9781137394064_3"", ""10.3406/rbph.1971.2892"", ""10.1080/13531049108575976"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199570485.003.0015"", ""10.4324/9781315108001-10"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199284641.003.0002"", ""10.1080/1360082042000221487"", ""10.1017/S0960777304001602"", ""10.2307/20028761""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

It contends that —despite the FSLN's ideological affiliation with Third World national liberation movements, Cuba, and the socialist bloc—the campaign to influence Western European foreign policies was central to the Sandinista government's international strategy. By pushing Western European governments to play a prominent role in Central America's violent Cold War conflicts, the Sandinistas sought to undermine US power in the isthmus and alter the inter-American dynamics that shaped their region's history up to the late 1970s. Furthermore, by building financial ties with Western European countries, the FSLN could avoid complete financial dependency on the Soviet bloc and strengthen Nicaragua's image as a nonaligned state. The Sandinistas’ campaign to challenge US hegemony in Central America through a pragmatic outreach to Western Europe was largely successful, but it came at the cost of implementing domestic reforms that ran counter to their own ambitions.

10.1017/tam.2020.36,AMERICAS,0603 World History,The Emergence of Alphabetic Writing:Tlahcuiloh and Escribano in Sixteenth-Century Mexico,"ABSTRACTOver the course of the sixteenth century in Mexico (New Spain), alphabetic writing replaced pictography as the chosen form of written expression in indigenous communities. A new social role, that of the native languageescribano(notary), emerged, eventually to become a principal cultural broker in the colonial period. Despite the indigenous escribano's importance, his origins and the source of his authority within the native sphere are poorly understood. This article offers a close reading of a corpus of hybrid pictographic-alphabetic documents, written in Nahuatl and created between 1553 and 1572 in the indigenouscabildo(town council) of Mexico-Tenochtitlan. Within this important body, escribanos appear early in the documentary record; it was within the established indigenous ecosystem of governance that escribanos first found a niche.Here, pictography flourished, as did performances unique to the indigenous sphere. The corpus reveals how escribanos worked side by side with indigenoustlahcuilohqueh, or painters, who drew on a long-established tradition of manuscript painting and cartography to create property maps. These maps adhered to established codes, both social and visual. Initially preeminent in itself, the work of thetlahcuilohquehcame to supply meaning and public authority to the work of the escribano in this crucial formative period.","[{""name"": ""Barbara E.

I construct a new transportation network to capture counties’ exposure to this trade shock and compile panel data to examine the impact on China’s manufactured textile industry. I find that counties with greater prewar exposure to international trade experienced more firm entry after the war. The effect was delayed because the war simultaneously hindered machinery imports.

Our panel analyses show that labor demands are strongly positively associated with mortality rates, likely resulting from malnourishment and unhygienic conditions on plantations and the spread of infectious diseases. An instrumental variable approach, using international market prices for coffee and sugar for predicting labor demands, addresses potential endogeneity concerns. Our estimates suggest that without the abolition of the Cultivation System average overall mortality in Java would have been between 10 and 30 percent higher by the late 1870s.","[{""name"": ""Pim de Zwart"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Gallardo-Albarrán"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Auke Rijpma"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1525/9780520341821"", ""10.1017/S0022050712000630"", ""10.1002/jid.1510"", ""10.1515/9780691229300"", ""10.3886/E143581V1"", ""10.1080/0032472031000143366"", ""10.1093/ej/ueaa030"", ""10.4324/9780203824610"", ""10.1023/B:JOEG.0000038933.16398.ed"", ""10.1093/restud/rdz017"", ""10.1163/9789004486881"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521228022"", ""10.1057/9780333994962"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139626323"", ""10.1111/1468-0297.00270"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316271438"", ""10.1257/089533002760278749"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817649"", ""10.1080/20780389.2010.527689"", ""10.1080/17441730.2011.544900"", ""10.1355/ae29-2j"", ""10.1162/003465398557825"", ""10.7312/bosm18852"", ""10.1016/S0014-4983(02)00028-1"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.12023"", ""10.1080/00324728.1982.10409030"", ""10.1093/ereh/hev007"", ""10.1163/9789004487710_014"", ""10.1007/BF01531182"", ""10.1007/s10887-016-9130-y"", ""10.2307/3517011"", ""10.1017/S0022050704043074"", ""10.1002/joc.5086"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00377.x"", ""10.1163/9789004615465"", ""10.1080/0032472031000145616""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Demography', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Since reachability is already known to be undecidable in the fragment of with only release-acquire accesses (-), we consider the fragment with only relaxed accesses and promises (). We show that reachability under is undecidable in general and that it becomes decidable, albeit non-primitive recursive, if we bound the number of promises.Given these results, we consider a bounded version of the reachability problem. To this end, we bound both the number of promises and of “view-switches”, i.e., the number of times the processes may switch their local views of the global memory. We provide a code-to-code translation from an input program under (with relaxed and release-acquire memory accesses along with promises) to a program under SC, thereby reducing the bounded reachability problem under to the bounded context-switching problem under SC. We have implemented a tool and tested it on a set of benchmarks, demonstrating that typical bugs in programs can be found with a small bound.","[{""name"": ""Parosh Aziz Abdulla"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Faouzi Atig"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adwait Godbole"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S.

The concept thus comes loaded with a specific outlook on the experience of modernity, which is – I argue – unsuitable for any cultural or social history of space. This article outlines the etymology of the concept and shows: first, that the historical phenomena it pretends to describe are too complex for such a simplistic signpost; and, second, that the term is never a neutral descriptor but always an engagement with a form of historical and cultural mediation on the nature of modernity in relation to space. In both cases this term obfuscates more than it reveals. As a counter-example, I look at the effect of the railways on popular representations of space and conclude that postmodern geography is a relative dead end for historians interested in the social and cultural history of space.","[{""name"": ""Alexis D.

In so doing, the article uses NCA as a fresh lens for analyzing the more general politics of post-Soviet state and nation-building in the country, situating this case within the “Quadratic Nexus” framework. Estonia’s NCA law is generally viewed as irrelevant to ongoing issues of diversity governance in the country. However, Finnish and Swedish minority autonomies have been established and, in recent years, there have been three applications to establish a Russian NCA. None have been approved, and yet some authors see them as evidence that NCA could (and should) have a role to play in bringing about a more meaningful accommodation of ethnic diversity. Having reviewed the evidence, however, the article concludes that this claim is misplaced.","[{""name"": ""David J.

10.1017/S0018246X2000045X,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,THE SOCIAL NETWORKS OF INVESTMENT IN EARLY MODERN ENGLAND,"AbstractThe launch of the East India Company in 1599 relied on the engagement of an investing public. Despite this, little is known about how and why ordinary individual investors chose to invest in the corporation or what institutional frameworks supported them. While the later ‘financial revolution’ would radically alter the relationship between the state, investors, and financial organizations, this process does not adequately explain the earlier development of an investing public. Using a newly developed dataset of members’ familial, neighbourhood, civic, and business connections, this article reconstructs the social networks of East India Company investors in 1599. This analysis reveals that the company was formulated within an intensely interconnected investment environment – linkages that were used to distribute information and provide access to seemingly illiquid markets. Social networks played a key role in how people decided about where, when, with whom, and how much to invest during the expansion of investment opportunities in early modern England.","[{""name"": ""EDMOND SMITH"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0018246X04003747"", ""10.1111/ehr.12665"", ""10.4324/9780203183281"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195335545.001.0001"", ""10.3982/ECTA11991"", ""10.1525/hlq.2004.67.3.423"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794479.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-2281.00139"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198767985.001.0001"", ""10.1109/TNSE.2015.2391998"", ""10.1093/oep/gpp038"", ""10.1086/ahr.112.4.1016"", ""10.1111/1467-937X.00059"", ""10.2307/2599423"", ""10.2307/j.ctt21c4tfn"", ""10.1525/9780520947573"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791307"", ""10.1215/10829636-34-3-611"", ""10.2307/3857876"", ""10.1017/S0022050700020532"", ""10.1111/1468-2281.12172"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-26879-5"", ""10.1017/9781316340493"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816674268.001.0001"", ""10.2307/205042"", ""10.1017/S0022050700009451"", ""10.1111/ehr.12069"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511755965"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195393736.001.0001"", ""10.1484/M.SEUH-EB.6.09070802050003050103080306"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674435179"", ""10.1080/07075332.2003.9641005"", ""10.1017/S002205070400292X"", ""10.1017/S0968565018000161"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000396"", ""10.1017/S0018246X19000037"", ""10.2307/3115542"", ""10.1017/S0022050711000015"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469622309.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0968565000000081"", ""10.1086/230603""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Demography', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

These metaphors are useful in helping economists reflect the nature of economics and their role in society. But which is the most sensible one? This paper argues that economists should be playing all these roles and more, because economics is not a single entity, and each entity has separate goals, methods, and boundaries. To take this multiplicity of roles into account, this paper argues that in addition to the traditional boundary that delineates the disciplinary domain of economics against other sciences, an overarching boundary between economic science and applied policy needs to be recognized. It then examines Esther Duflo’s “economist as plumber” metaphor and suggests that a better metaphor for Duflo’s purpose would be “general contractor,” a metaphor that, if accepted, would suggest radical change in training applied policy economists.","[{""name"": ""Huei-Chun Su"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Colander"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1257/aer.99.4.1145"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805639"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226321356.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199841608.001.0001"", ""10.1257/jep.20.4.29"", ""10.1146/annurev.economics.050708.143235"", ""10.1080/00014788.2018.1470151"", ""10.1111/1468-0262.00335"", ""10.2307/2222645"", ""10.1177/0569434518783386"", ""10.1017/S1053837209990241"", ""10.1044/leader.PPL.21032016.16"", ""10.1215/00182702-4166239"", ""10.1257/aer.p20171153"", ""10.1215/00182702-32-Suppl_1-1"", ""10.1016/bs.hefe.2016.09.005"", ""10.1257/jel.20191585"", ""10.1257/jel.20151296""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X20000369,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,THE DEEP PAST OF PRE-COLONIAL AUSTRALIA,"AbstractHuman occupation of Australia dates back to at least 65,000 years. Aboriginal ontologies incorporate deep memories of this past, at times accompanied by a conviction that Aboriginal people have always been there. This poses a problem for historians and archaeologists: how to construct meaningful histories that extend across such a long duration of space and time. While earlier generations of scholars interpreted pre-colonial Aboriginal history as static and unchanging, marked by isolation and cultural conservatism, recent historical scholarship presents Australia's deep past as dynamic and often at the cutting-edge of human technological innovation. This historiographical shift places Aboriginal people at the centre of pre-colonial history by incorporating Aboriginal oral histories and material culture, as well as ethnographic and anthropological accounts. This review considers some of the debates within this expansive and expanding field, focusing in particular on questions relating to Aboriginal agriculture and land management and connections between Aboriginal communities and their Southeast Asian neighbours. At the same time, the study of Australia's deep past has become a venue for confronting colonial legacies, while also providing a new disciplinary approach to the question of reconciliation and the future of Aboriginal sovereignty in Australia.","[{""name"": ""STEPHANIE MAWSON"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/03122417.1983.12092875"", ""10.1038/nature22968"", ""10.1007/s11759-019-09382-7"", ""10.1080/1031461X.2011.566273"", ""10.1111/j.1478-0542.2006.00301.x"", ""10.22459/AH.35.2011.06"", ""10.22459/AH.42.2018.02"", ""10.1080/14490854.2016.1202336"", ""10.7183/0002-7316.81.1.27"", ""10.1080/03122417.2010.11689384"", ""10.1002/j.1834-4461.1972.tb01183.x"", ""10.1071/RS18007"", ""10.30722/sup.9781743325445"", ""10.1080/1031461X.2013.817454"", ""10.1016/j.quaint.2016.12.047"", ""10.1017/9781316481066"", ""10.1071/9781486306121"", ""10.1002/j.1834-4453.1986.tb00126.x"", ""10.1017/S0003598X00082284"", ""10.18195/issn.0313-122x.79.2011.004-015"", ""10.1177/1474474018821419"", ""10.1016/j.quaint.2016.08.036"", ""10.1016/j.biocon.2014.11.008"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0186663"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2018.06.014"", ""10.1016/j.quaint.2016.12.033"", ""10.1002/j.1834-4453.1982.tb00039.x"", ""10.1071/MF18009"", ""10.1017/S0003598X00098884"", ""10.25120/qar.2.1985.194"", ""10.18195/issn.0313-122x.79.2011.086-092"", ""10.1163/9789004486911"", ""10.1080/00049182.2015.1077539"", ""10.1016/j.jas.2013.06.021"", ""10.1002/j.1834-4453.1997.tb00388.x"", ""10.1075/clu.18.11lan"", ""10.30861/9781407303543"", ""10.1002/arco.1983.18.2.81"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139023016"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107444973"", ""10.3197/096734018X15254461646378"", ""10.1080/1031461X.2015.1035289"", ""10.1080/00438243.2016.1213657""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Geography, Planning and Development', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X19000153,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,THE COAL QUESTION BEFORE JEVONS,"AbstractIn the early nineteenth century, political economists, politicians, and geologists debated the size and duration of the British coal supply. For mineral Malthusians, the argument about a dwindling supply sharpened anxieties about population pressure, fuel demand, and limited resources.

While critical of their Victorian predecessors’ reliance on petitions, the Edwardian women's suffrage movement did not abandon petitioning, but reinvented it. Rather than presenting a polarized view of relations between suffragettes and suffragists, the article shows how both operated on a spectrum of direct action politics through petitioning. Militants and constitutionalists pioneered new, although different, modes of petitioning that underpinned broader repertoires of popular politics, adapting this venerable practice to a nascent mass democracy. The article then situates suffrage campaigners’ reinvention of petitioning within a broader political context. The apparent decline of petitioning, long noted by scholars, is reframed as the waning of the classic model of mass petitioning parliament associated with Victorian pressure groups. The early twentieth century was a crucial period for the reshaping of petitioning as a tool for political participation and expression through myriad subscriptional forms, rather than primarily through the medium of parliamentary petitions.","[{""name"": ""HENRY MILLER"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-1-349-00652-6"", ""10.1017/ssh.2019.24"", ""10.1515/9781782049074"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139208611"", ""10.1093/ehr/cei119"", ""10.1017/S000305541400029X"", ""10.1179/174581809X408375"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495700"", ""10.1080/03086534.2017.1302118"", ""10.1017/ssh.2019.22"", ""10.1093/ehr/ces073"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719087615.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9780755622313"", ""10.4324/9780203358528"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-04751-9"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511585661"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-50020-1_3"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.1955.tb01105.x"", ""10.1017/S0898588X18000032"", ""10.1093/ehr/116.466.368"", ""10.4324/9780203383612-ch-5"", ""10.1017/S1537592716001134"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198728481.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230592063"", ""10.1086/386223"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511571473"", ""10.5871/bacad/9780197264492.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2281.2011.00586.x"", ""10.1093/ehr/LXXV.296.444"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtm051""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

We present a novel condition on barrier certificates, termed theinvariant barrier-certificate condition, that witnesses unbounded-time safety of differential dynamical systems. The proposed condition is by far the least conservative one on barrier certificates, and can be shown as the weakest possible one to attain inductive invariance. We show that discharging the invariant barrier-certificate condition—thereby synthesizing invariant barrier certificates—can be encoded as solving anoptimization problem subject to bilinear matrix inequalities(BMIs). We further propose a synthesis algorithm based on difference-of-convex programming, which approaches a local optimum of the BMI problem via solvinga series of convex optimization problems. This algorithm is incorporated in a branch-and-bound framework that searches for the global optimum in a divide-and-conquer fashion. We present a weak completeness result of our method, in the sense that a barrier certificate is guaranteed to be found (under some mild assumptions) whenever there exists an inductive invariant (in the form of a given template) that suffices to certify safety of the system. Experimental results on benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","[{""name"": ""Qiuye Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mingshuai Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bai Xue"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Naijun Zhan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joost-Pieter Katoen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0304-3975(94)00202-T"", ""10.1007/3-540-45351-2_9"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804441"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_29"", ""10.1090/pspum/058.2/1327293"", ""10.1137/S1052623402417298"", ""10.1016/j.jsc.2016.07.010"", ""10.1137/S036012995279031"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2016.12.013"", ""10.1007/s10270-012-0295-3"", ""10.1007/s10440-014-9974-0"", ""10.1145/3313909.3313913"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24953-7_34"", ""10.1109/ECC.2016.7810321"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25543-5_9"", ""10.1007/BF01099648"", ""10.1109/ACC.2014.6859330"", ""10.1109/ACC.2001.946009"", ""10.1007/s10589-005-3231-4"", ""10.1145/2562059.2562139"", ""10.1109/CDC.2018.8619567"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-02950-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96142-2_15"", ""10.1006/jsco.2001.0472"", ""10.1142/p665"", ""10.1007/s10107-018-1235-y"", ""10.1137/S1052623400375865"", ""10.1007/s12532-018-0137-6"", ""10.1145/2038642.2038659"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2006.05.026"", ""10.21236/ADA476791"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24743-2_32"", ""10.1007/11856290_18"", ""10.1145/1210268.1210276"", ""10.1137/090749955"", ""10.1137/070697835"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24743-2_36"", ""10.1016/j.amc.2005.09.077"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95582-7_25"", ""10.1016/S0304-0208(08)72402-2"", ""10.1525/9780520348097"", ""10.1007/3-540-36580-X_37"", ""10.1002/1099-1239(200006)10:7<561::AID-RNC493>3.0.CO;2-C"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_21"", ""10.1109/CDC.2016.7798758"", ""10.1007/s10107-010-0354-x"", ""10.1145/2629424"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48989-6_44"", ""10.1145/2968478.2968484"", ""10.1109/TCAD.2018.2858383""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

They are relevant for not only general purpose programming languages, but also for many domain specific languages. Bugs in compilers can potentially render all programs at risk. It is thus crucial that compilers are systematically tested, if not verified. Recently, a number of efforts have been made to formalise and standardise programming language semantics, which can be applied to verify the correctness of the respective compilers. In this work, we present a novel specification-based testing method named SpecTest to better utilise these semantics for testing. By applying an executable semantics as test oracle, SpecTest can discover deep semantic errors in compilers. Compared to existing approaches, SpecTest is built upon a novel test coverage criterion called semantic coverage which brings together mutation testing and fuzzing to specifically target less tested language features. We apply SpecTest to systematically test two compilers, i.e., the Java compiler and the Solidity compiler. SpecTest improves the semantic coverage of both compilers considerably and reveals multiple previously unknown bugs.","[{""name"": ""Richard Schumi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jun Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/TSE.2014.2372785"", ""10.1145/2676726.2676982"", ""10.1016/S0950-5849(97)00017-7"", ""10.1145/2884781.2884878"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2019.00127"", ""10.1145/3213846.3213848"", ""10.1145/2103656.2103719"", ""10.1147/sj.94.0242"", ""10.1145/229000.226322"", ""10.1109/TSE.2010.62"", ""10.1016/S1571-0661(05)82625-8"", ""10.1145/2103656.2103691"", ""10.1109/AST.2019.00010"", ""10.1007/s11086-005-0008-6"", ""10.1145/2594291.2594334"", ""10.1145/2814270.2814319"", ""10.1145/2771783.2771785"", ""10.1145/1538788.1538814"", ""10.1145/3377811.3380334"", ""10.1145/2737924.2737991"", ""10.1109/NTMS.2019.8763848"", ""10.1007/BF01932308"", ""10.1016/j.jlap.2010.03.012"", ""10.1017/S0956796809990293"", ""10.1002/spe.812"", ""10.1145/2884781.2884879"", ""10.1145/2983990.2984038"", ""10.1109/APSEC.2010.39"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-00018-9_3"", ""10.1145/1993498.1993532"", ""10.1007/11759744_13"", ""10.1109/32.988498""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

In a compositional verification setting, where the system consists of processes executing in parallel, this partition allows us to decide whether each individual process can be minimized for either divergence-preserving branching (if the process contains only weak actions) or strong (otherwise) bisimilarity, while preserving the truth value of the formula. In this paper, we refine this idea by devising a family of bisimilarity relations, named sharp bisimilarities, parameterized by the set of strong actions. We show that these relations have all the nice properties necessary to be used for compositional verification, in particular congruence and adequacy with the logic. We also illustrate their practical utility on several examples and case-studies, and report about our success in the RERS 2019 model checking challenge.","[{""name"": ""Frédéric Lang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Radu Mateescu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Franco Mazzanti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1006/jcss.1999.1660"", ""10.1007/s10009-004-0159-4"", ""10.1007/s10009-004-0185-2"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.14.3"", ""10.1177/1094342006070078"", ""10.1007/3-540-54233-7_126"", ""10.1145/828.833"", ""10.1145/256428.167071"", ""10.1145/5397.5399"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-19811-3_9"", ""10.1007/3-540-55179-4_18"", ""10.1016/0022-0000(79)90046-1"", ""10.1016/j.jlamp.2018.11.005"", ""10.1007/0-306-47003-9_24"", ""10.1007/s00236-015-0226-1"", ""10.1007/s10009-012-0244-z"", ""10.3233/FI-2009-109"", ""10.1145/233551.233556"", ""10.1007/BFb0023732"", ""10.1145/3060140"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(96)80702-X"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(82)90125-6"", ""10.1007/11589976_6"", ""10.2168/LMCS-9(4:1)2013"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30942-8_13"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-3534-0_7"", ""10.1007/3-540-53479-2_17"", ""10.1007/BFb0017309"", ""10.1109/26.35374"", ""10.1016/S0019-9958(82)91258-X"", ""10.1007/3-540-56689-9_54"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2015.05.013"", ""10.1145/120807.120812"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(99)00084-5""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)]]"

Over the past thirty years, the world's workforce has increasingly found employment in low-wage, low-productivity jobs in the global services sector. The pandemic lockdowns hit these sorts of activities the hardest. Opportunities to work evaporated, spreading both poverty and hunger around the world. The same rise in global service sector employment shares, which amplified the pandemic lockdown's destructive effects, will now slow the pace of the recovery. The transition to a services-based economy has accelerated, due to what José Antonio Ocampo and Tomasso Faccio call “too much excess capacity and too little certainty about future demand,” which have depressed levels of investment and ushered in a period of economic stagnation. COVID-19 will make these tendencies worse. Weak economic recoveries will further entrench an economic order in which employers pay little attention to workers’ demands, deepening employment insecurity and economic inequality. The future for labor looks bleak. What that means for the future of working people remains an open question. Their fight for dignity, in the midst of the pandemic and post-pandemic eras, will prove decisive.","[{""name"": ""Aaron Benanav"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10887-015-9122-3"", ""10.1126/science.abc0035""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Mathematics', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Modeling and Simulation']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X20000424,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,SWADESHI CAPITALISM IN COLONIAL BOMBAY,"AbstractThis article examines economic nationalism in India, specifically the role of capitalists in late colonial Bombay. It shows how swadeshi was the fulcrum that supported the expressions of nationalism and capitalism. The notion that Indian capital needed to be used for the benefit of Indian nationals became established as nationalist thought by the 1930s. Such swadeshi capitalism – Indian capital for Indian industries – recasts the notion of swadeshi as a broader, more sophisticated cultural response to colonialism and globalization. As capitalism transitioned from mercantile activities to capital-hungry industrialization, nationalism was itself reframed from being anti-colonial in 1905 to being anti-globalization by the 1950s. Swadeshi capitalism helped to overlay a radical, grittier form of economic nationalism over the intellectually driven version of the nineteenth century. Swadeshi, as a form of economic patriotism, can be distinguished from similar expressions of nationalism within the British empire and dominions. This article is an effort to decolonize the narratives of modern capitalism by shifting the focus away from the global West. It will appeal to readers interested in South Asian history, and those interested in cultural responses to globalization, the contested nature of economic nationalism, and histories of capitalism in the global South.","[{""name"": ""AASHISH VELKAR"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9780230594869"", ""10.1017/9781316906903"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816670369.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1740022817000195"", ""10.2307/2222916"", ""10.1080/10304312.2018.1525926"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199457595.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511750533"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-19712-5"", ""10.1017/S0026749X07003460"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1tg5k14"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139108638"", ""10.5040/9780755625512"", ""10.2307/2057379"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195670585.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03086534.2018.1452539"", ""10.1080/20780389.2017.1292460"", ""10.1215/9780822392477"", ""10.1080/14736480802665238"", ""10.1177/000271624423300121""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

By looking more broadly at Russian strategic narratives aimed at persuading other global actors and publics abroad and at home, this article identifies how Russia attempted to develop a story that could win global acceptance. This analysis shows that contrary to traditional Russian emphasis on sovereign responsibility and non-intervention, Russia supported claims for self-determination by separatist groups in Georgia and Ukraine. Russia used deception and disinformation in its strategic narratives as it mis-characterized these conflicts using Responsibility to Protect (R2P) language, yet mostly justified its own interventions through references to other sources of international law. Russian strategic narratives focused on delegitimizing the perceived opponents, making the case for the appropriateness of its own actions, and projecting what it proposed as the proper solution to the conflicts. It largely avoided making any references to its own involvement in the Donbas at all. Additionally, Russia’s focus on the protection of co-ethnics and Russian-speakers is reminiscent of interventions in the pre-R2P era.","[{""name"": ""Juris Pupcenoks"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eric James Seltzer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0010836713482448"", ""10.1177/1750635213516696"", ""10.1057/9780230292413_8"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12343"", ""10.1111/j.1528-3585.2010.00412.x"", ""10.1177/1461444816656638"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190253301.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12170"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199590636.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139644518.009"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00762.x"", ""10.1080/00396338.2013.767403"", ""10.1177/0010836715612849"", ""10.1177/0047117816659590"", ""10.1177/1354066113476118"", ""10.1057/9780230292413_4"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12459"", ""10.1080/03932729.2015.1085944"", ""10.1080/09662830903468734"", ""10.1080/03050629.2016.1185420"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-43201-4"", ""10.2307/j.ctvvnh3m"", ""10.1525/curh.2014.113.759.19"", ""10.1163/1875984X-00504002"", ""10.1177/0047117809366205"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199561049.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0967010610370228"", ""10.3998/mpub.6504652"", ""10.1080/16161262.2001.10555046"", ""10.1093/irap/lcu018""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

10.1017/S0067237820000156,AUSTRIAN HISTORY YEARBOOK,0603 World History,"Respectable Citizens: Civic Militias, Local Patriotism, and Social Order in Late Habsburg Austria (1890-1920)","AbstractThis article analyzes the role of urban civic militias (burgher corps) in Habsburg Austria from the end of the nineteenth century to the aftermath of World War I. Far from a remnant of the early modern past, by the turn of the twentieth century these militias were thriving local institutions. They fostered dynastic patriotism and participated in the growing promotion of shooting among the population in the lead-up to the conflict. But they also played a major role in upholding the bourgeois ideals of protection of social hierarchies and property. In the context of the rise of the workers' movement and social unrest, the militias saw themselves as bulwarks of social order and bastions of bourgeois virtue. They reflected an exclusive conception of armed citizenship opposed to the egalitarian notion of the citizen-soldier that survived into the twentieth century. The sensory experience of burgher corps parades during the patriotic or church celebrations was supposed to convey stability and express hierarchies in the urban space. This article also links the practices of armed civilians before the war to the paramilitary groups that emerged in 1918 and emphasizes the legacy of local conceptions of armed defense of property and of notions of “good” citizenship in the aftermath of the war.","[{""name"": ""Claire Morelon"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/jsh/sht108"", ""10.4000/clio.12153"", ""10.17104/1611-8944_2007_2_194"", ""10.1002/9781444323634"", ""10.1080/19475020.2017.1333018"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672042.001.0001"", ""10.3167/9781845452025"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195134650.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794486.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9781137316516_13"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77h3r"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195335491.003.0005"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199571208.001.0001"", ""10.1086/660364"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198789291.001.0001"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtm046"", ""10.4159/9780674969346"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtx028"", ""10.3917/ving.118.0159"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199654918.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230288683"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtv030"", ""10.1017/S0067237809000095"", ""10.7767/9783205208549"", ""10.1524/9783486713749"", ""10.1017/S0067237813000106"", ""10.1524/9783486857566"", ""10.13109/9783666351396"", ""10.3917/puf.larre.2016.03"", ""10.1524/9783486707458"", ""10.1163/156916100746437"", ""10.1017/9781316219027"", ""10.1057/9780230305519"", ""10.3917/rhu.054.0055"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtz006"", ""10.1017/S0067237811000099""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Yet its effect on religious identities has yet to be written. This article illuminates a printed discourse in which Protestants laboured to define a new relationship to food and eating in light of the Reformation, from Elizabeth I's reign up until the Civil War. It is based on a wealth of religious tracts written by the clergy, alongside the work of physicians in the form of dietaries and regimens, which together highlight the close relationship between bodily and spiritual concerns. As a result of the theological changes of the Reformation, reformers sought to desacralize Catholic notions of holy food. However, by paying greater attention to the body, this article argues that eating continued to be a religiously significant act, which could both threaten spiritual health and enrich it. This discourse on food and eating helped draw the confessional boundaries and identities of the Reformation period, and so offers a rewarding and novel insight into English Protestantism.","[{""name"": ""ELEANOR BARNETT"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/past/148.1.89"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199243556.001.0001"", ""10.1086/499638"", ""10.1525/california/9780520253216.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203863497"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300170627.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S002204690002594X"", ""10.1086/ahr.115.2.351"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199678136.001.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520927285"", ""10.7765/9781526113498"", ""10.1086/ahr.115.3.688"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199565726.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jaarel/LXIII.3.565"", ""10.5040/9781474210669"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511933905"", ""10.4324/9781315212920"", ""10.1146/annurev.anthro.32.032702.131011"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511763359"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195172621.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350008496"", ""10.5040/9798400652622"", ""10.1017/S0095139000069143""]",['Agricultural and Biological Sciences'],['Food Science'],"[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)]]"

After the destruction of the Armenian community, these ruined structures took on new afterlives as they became part of the evolving environments and communities around them. These ruined spaces play a role in the everyday lives of the people who live among them and shape their historical understandings and relationships with the local history and geography. I interrogate the afterlives of one abandoned monastery and examine how local Kurds imagine, narrate, and enact the politics of the past and the present through that space of material ruin. I demonstrate how the history of the Armenian Genocide and ongoing state violence against the Kurdish community are intricately linked, highlight the continuation of violence over the past century, and deconstruct notions of ahistorical victims and perpetrators. This article builds on a critical approach to ruins as it traces how histories of destruction and spaces of material ruin are revisited and reinterpreted by those whose lives continue to be shaped by processes of ruination. It demonstrates how ruins created through violent histories become spaces for articulating alternative senses of history and crafting possible futures.","[{""name"": ""Anoush Tamar Suni"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2979/his.2010.22.2.68"", ""10.1177/1463499614554239"", ""10.1017/S0010417509000152"", ""10.1215/08992363-3511574"", ""10.1002/9781118475683.ch23"", ""10.1080/13537110701293500"", ""10.1086/657626"", ""10.4000/eac.1847"", ""10.1353/anq.2016.0013"", ""10.1093/hgs/dcw063"", ""10.1017/S0020743817000733"", ""10.3751/63.4.14"", ""10.1007/s10624-013-9297-y"", ""10.4324/9780429344152"", ""10.1163/1573384X-20190409"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004155572.i-355"", ""10.4000/ejts.5200"", ""10.1080/19448953.2011.623869"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-010220-075549"", ""10.1007/s10624-013-9303-4"", ""10.9783/9780812296594"", ""10.1080/19448953.2011.621785"", ""10.1163/9789004314825"", ""10.1057/s41286-017-0026-x"", ""10.14506/ca31.1.03""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

It can fool a DNN into misclassifying an input image by occluding some segments, possibly resulting in severe errors. Therefore, DNNs planted in safety-critical systems should be verified to be robust against occlusions prior to deployment. However, most existing robustness verification approaches for DNNs are focused on non-semantic perturbations and are not suited to the occlusion case. In this paper, we propose the first efficient, SMT-based approach for formally verifying the occlusion robustness of DNNs. We formulate the occlusion robustness verification problem and prove it is NP-complete. Then, we devise a novel approach for encoding occlusions as a part of neural networks and introduce two acceleration techniques so that the extended neural networks can be efficiently verified using off-the-shelf, SMT-based neural network verification tools. We implement our approach in a prototype called OccRob and extensively evaluate its performance on benchmark datasets with various occlusion variants. The experimental results demonstrate our approach’s effectiveness and efficiency in verifying DNNs’ robustness against various occlusions, and its ability to generate counterexamples when these DNNs are not robust.","[{""name"": ""Xingwu Guo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ziwei Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yueling Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guy Katz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Min Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_11"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013240"", ""10.1109/MEES.2017.8248937"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_3"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00175"", ""10.1109/SP.2018.00058"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2019.00494"", ""10.1109/ISSRE52982.2021.00044"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30823-9_11"", ""10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706807"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1"", ""10.1145/3377811.3380378"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-6533-2_12"", ""10.1007/s11263-020-01401-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-32304-2_15"", ""10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00429"", ""10.1609/aaai.v34i04.5944"", ""10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00032"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-36808-1_30"", ""10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308"", ""10.1145/3132747.3132785"", ""10.1145/3290354"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2019.00086"", ""10.1109/TEVC.2019.2890858"", ""10.1145/3180155.3180220"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_1""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1017/S147924432000027X,MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Neoconservatives and Neo-Confucians: East Asian Growth and the Celebration of Tradition,"This article explores the influence of East Asia's economic growth on the evolution of American neoconservative thought in the 1970s and 1980s. It traces how prominent neoconservative thinkers—Nathan Glazer, Peter L. Berger, Herman Kahn, Michael Novak, and Lawrence E. Harrison—developed the claim that the region's prosperity stemmed from its alleged Confucian tradition. Drawing in part from East Asian leaders and scholars, they argued that the region's growth demonstrated that tradition had facilitated, rather than hampered, the development of a distinct East Asian capitalist modernity. The article argues that this Confucian thesis helped American neoconservatives articulate their conviction that “natural” social hierarchies, religious commitment, and traditional families were necessary for healthy and free capitalist societies. It then charts how neoconservatives mobilized this interpretation of Confucian East Asia against postcolonial critiques of capitalism, especially dependency theory. East Asia, they claimed, demonstrated that poverty and wealth were determined not by patterns of welfare, structural exploitation, or foreign assistance, but values and culture. The concept of Confucian capitalism, the article shows, was central to neoconservatives’ broad ideological agenda of protecting political, economic, and racial inequality under the guise of values, culture, and tradition.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer M.

While the immigrant has figured in the U.S. national imaginary as someone whodesiresAmerica, the American Indian was notdesiredto enter into political membership—although Native land was desired, and subsequently taken by settlers through strategies of dispossession written into federal Indian law. This essay argues that theIndian—read as an imagined category with little connection to the lives ofNativepeople—occupies an anomalous position in the legal history of naturalization, finalized with the passing of the Indian Citizenship Act in 1924, at the same time that racist immigration restriction quotas also limited the entrance of new immigrants into the United States through the 1924 Johnson-Reed Immigration Act. For Native people, Americanization and the imposition of citizenship were extensions of colonialism, adding one civic status over another—domestic dependent, ward, or U.S. citizen. For new immigrants hailing from southern and eastern Europe, forced by economic and cultural constraints to relocate to the United States, in contrast to their Anglo-Saxon or Nordic settler predecessors, Americanization meant a renunciation of political allegiance to other sovereigns, the acquisition of English, and civic education for citizenship. This essay challenges the myth of America as a “nation of immigrants,” and the settler colonial nation-state's ongoing infatuation with its colonial project as it continues to erase Indigenous presence and sovereignty.","[{""name"": ""Cristina Stanciu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4159/harvard.9780674061309"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195152180.001.0001"", ""10.1353/jsh/14.1.67"", ""10.2307/j.ctt5vkgqk"", ""10.2307/j.ctt22p7jmt"", ""10.1353/aiq.2013.0035"", ""10.1215/9780822393382"", ""10.7560/706880"", ""10.1057/9781137372475"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511777943"", ""10.9783/9781512802986"", ""10.1215/9780822387039"", ""10.1215/9780822379010"", ""10.17953/aicr.36.1.d35pr5h374lq8p21"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816676408.001.0001"", ""10.2307/970489"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674435056"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300171570.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Accordingly, emphasis has been put on the lack of opportunities for Russians to integrate into an Estonian context. While acknowledging the shortfalls of the Estonian political project, this article contrasts these views in two ways. By emphasizing people’s agency and their capacity to question, contrast, or even reject the identity markers proposed by Estonian official narratives, we maintain that the integration of Russians might be more advanced than insofar claimed by other studies. We then look at the way identities are lived in an everyday context by inhabitants of Estonia to counterpose national narratives proposed by the state and its political institutions, with the way people live and whether they accept these narratives. By doing this, we explore the role of the everyday in the reconstruction of national identity narratives, in which citizens actively participate in their individual capacity. We suggest that, from a James Scott “infrapolitics” perspective, these micro-actions have a fundamental role in the reshaping of a national identity and its acceptance among citizens.","[{""name"": ""Abel Polese"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oleksandra Seliverstova"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tanel Kerikmae"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ammon Cheskin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00905992.2016.1220363"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-32178-7"", ""10.1080/01419870.1990.9993663"", ""10.1111/j.1354-5078.2004.00164.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.an.24.100195.001041"", ""10.1016/j.jsp.2005.10.001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-47773-2_3"", ""10.3138/9781442688438"", ""10.3917/hp.017.0130"", ""10.4324/9781315185880-7"", ""10.1515/9780804766036"", ""10.1080/01419870.1996.9993927"", ""10.4324/9781315824048"", ""10.4324/9781315185880-12"", ""10.3224/eris.v2i2.20678"", ""10.1080/00905992.2015.1028913"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511840012"", ""10.1080/03050060903538673"", ""10.1080/01629778.2016.1164203"", ""10.3167/9781845455149"", ""10.4324/9781315597386"", ""10.1525/aa.1999.101.2.244"", ""10.1111/nana.12269"", ""10.1525/9780520937253"", ""10.4324/9780203434857"", ""10.1080/09668130701239971"", ""10.4074/S0338059913003057"", ""10.1177/0888325499013001005"", ""10.1177/0888325415584047"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2008.08.002"", ""10.4074/S0338059914003088"", ""10.4324/9781315185880"", ""10.1080/00905999608408438"", ""10.5040/9781350986824"", ""10.32422/mv.1690"", ""10.1177/0003122410372226"", ""10.2307/j.ctv10crg7c"", ""10.1080/00905992.2013.870986"", ""10.1080/01629778.2013.860609"", ""10.1080/01419870.1993.9993770"", ""10.1177/1468796808088925"", ""10.1515/9789048512881-012"", ""10.1080/09668136.2012.712275"", ""10.5325/j.ctv14gpdgw"", ""10.1080/713674313"", ""10.1080/09668130600732100"", ""10.1177/1466138110372586"", ""10.1080/03050060903538673"", ""10.1163/9789042029903"", ""10.1057/9780230353893"", ""10.1080/00905992.2017.1287167"", ""10.1080/00905992.2013.774341"", ""10.1177/1469540507077667"", ""10.1080/01629778.2012.712335"", ""10.56021/9780801851575"", ""10.4324/9781315610993"", ""10.1080/01629770902722294"", ""10.1080/01629770902722286"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511613067"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139104005"", ""10.1515/9789048512881"", ""10.4324/9781315185880"", ""10.1080/14608944.2014.934214"", ""10.1080/0014184022000031185"", ""10.1080/00905992.2014.924489"", ""10.1007/s10993-006-9004-9"", ""10.2307/j.ctvgs09pg"", ""10.1017/S0047279401006584"", ""10.1177/1469540519891276"", ""10.1177/1469540504040902"", ""10.1080/09668130120085029"", ""10.4324/9780203848951"", ""10.1080/15235882.2004.10162814"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748697434.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01629770902722278"", ""10.3406/homso.1974.1855"", ""10.1080/01419870.1988.9993590"", ""10.1080/01629770100000211"", ""10.1111/nana.12022"", ""10.1080/09668130601072589""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Anthropology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Using novel data on WWI veterans and an election panel from 1893–1933, I find that former soldiers are associated with a sizeable, persistent, and momentous shift in political preferences from left to right. I provide suggestive evidence that war participation made veterans highly receptive to nationalism and Anti-Communism. This alienated them from leftwing parties and drove the majority toward the political right. Contrary to historical accounts, veterans’ shifts in political preferences cannot be explained by exposure to violence or other polarizing post-war events.","[{""name"": ""Christoph Koenig"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0022050720000601"", ""10.1017/S002081831500020X"", ""10.3886/E183463V1"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511562761.006"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.esr.a018258"", ""10.1093/restud/rdt040"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139136891"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511583087"", ""10.1086/690949"", ""10.1162/rest_a_00930"", ""10.1093/ej/uez008"", ""10.1093/qje/qjv030"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2021.104477"", ""10.1086/687528"", ""10.3167/9781782383529"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195066104.001.0001"", ""10.17104/1611-8944_2003_1_24"", ""10.1017/9781108182423"", ""10.17104/1611-8944_2003_1_80"", ""10.1353/wp.2001.0007"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.57.3.416"", ""10.1257/aer.20180805"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511497155"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3753869"", ""10.1007/978-3-531-18932-1_24"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1bh4c2d"", ""10.1093/qje/qjs019"", ""10.1093/qje/qjw020"", ""10.1177/106591296301600112""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Gender Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Early-modern England witnessed debates about the desirability of wider dissemination of legal learning. Previous scholarship has identified the long-term trend to increased printing of the law in English, focusing on ideological debates between lawyers and other key actors. Only selected texts and types of material were made available to the wider public before the 1620s. From the later 1620s a wider range of material which had hitherto existed only in manuscript was printed in English. Knowledge of the common law became more commonly available. This article identifies this crucial moment and explains the change. Rather than the ideological questions which are discussed in the existing literature, more mundane causes are identified for the legal profession's reduced control over the transmission of legal knowledge: a shift to the use of English by lawyers themselves, and a loss of professional control over manuscripts. The paper therefore demonstrates an important methodological point: understanding and assessing the history of legal printing requires engagement with older methods of transmitting the law.","[{""name"": ""Ian Williams"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781316343111"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107706798"", ""10.1093/notesj/gjx048"", ""10.1093/ehr/LXXIV.293.672"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495427"", ""10.1080/01440365.2018.1532593"", ""10.1163/157181911X563057"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316090930"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198184713.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S000819730009245X"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198112198.003.0002"", ""10.7227/BJRL.35.2.7"", ""10.2307/3312623"", ""10.7591/9781501728501""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Thus, installing the charging infrastructure in convenient locations will play a critical role in the transition to eBuses. Taking this into account, in this paper we propose an iterated local search algorithm to optimize the location of charging stations while satisfying certain properties of the transportation system, e.g., satisfying the demand and ensuring that the limited driving range of the buses will not impact the service. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by experimenting with a set of problem instances with real data from 3 Irish cities, i.e., Limerick, Cork, and Dublin. We compare our approach against a MIP-based solution.

Which History?,"There can be little doubt that the history profession is experiencing a turn to the present. The post-2016 “crisis of democracy” has only dramatized it. Long-standing anxieties over presentism have crumbled under the weight of recent events. They have proven little match for Brexit, Trump, the rise of strongmen in the world writ large, racial injustice, and the pandemic. The turn to the present, however, is at times marked by undeniable provincialism—one that consistently offers a narrow perspective for understanding new and emerging global realities. Some historians, for instance, have taken on the role of liberal watchmen ready to strike the tocsin against suspected fascism, but they regularly do so by focusing on Europe's fascist past of the 1930s to explain the contemporary order. Or consider the economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. In the search for solutions, scholars proved quick to make historical comparisons to the great war economies of World Wars I and II, but appeared little bothered by the possibility that taking inspiration from Europe's age of extremes might “lead us to look for enemies and scapegoats.” So with the George Floyd protests: certain scholars and pundits likened them to the 1968 student protests in France and the United States, even as other scholars pointed out the historical shortcoming of the comparison.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/pastj/gtw054"", ""10.1093/jahist/jaaa335"", ""10.1017/S1479244320000219"", ""10.1215/21599785-8221515""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1007/s11698-020-00220-3,CLIOMETRICA,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Inequality in late colonial Indonesia: new evidence on regional differences,"AbstractThis paper adds to a growing literature that charts and explains inequality levels in pre-industrial societies. On the basis of a wide variety of primary documents, the degree of inequality is estimated for 32 different residencies, the largest administrative units and comparable to present-day provinces, of late colonial Indonesia. Four different measures of inequality (the Gini, Theil, Inequality Extraction Rate and Top Income Rate) are employed that show consistent results. Variation in inequality levels across late colonial Indonesia is very large, and some residencies have much higher levels of inequality (with, for example, Ginis above 60) than others (with Ginis below 30). This suggests that even within a single colony, levels of inequality may vary substantially and this puts some doubts on the representativeness of using a single number to capture the level of inequality in a large economy. In order to explain the variation across residencies and over time, this paper investigates the role of exports and plantations, so frequently mentioned in the literature. It is shown that both explain a part of the variation in levels of inequality across colonial Indonesia, but that only the rise of plantations can explain changes in inequality levels over time. This points to the importance of the institutional context in which global export trade takes place for the rise of inequality.","[{""name"": ""Pim de Zwart"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/ehr.12079"", ""10.1257/aer.20161080"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00515.x"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7287.2012.00343.x"", ""10.1007/s00181-016-1131-3"", ""10.1017/S0022463400019007"", ""10.1017/S0022463400000588"", ""10.1057/9780333994962"", ""10.7312/bosm18852"", ""10.5117/9789089642646"", ""10.4324/9780203824610"", ""10.1080/00472336.2020.1765189"", ""10.1162/003465398557825"", ""10.1002/joc.5086"", ""10.1016/j.ehb.2012.04.014"", ""10.1080/01615440.2014.963775"", ""10.1525/9780520341821"", ""10.1108/S1529-213420180000023012"", ""10.1111/ecin.12865"", ""10.1080/00472336.2012.706482"", ""10.1007/s10887-013-9099-8"", ""10.1007/s11698-016-0153-6"", ""10.4159/9780674969797"", ""10.1111/ehr.12613"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02403.x"", ""10.1017/S0212610909990048"", ""10.4159/9780674369542"", ""10.1007/978-94-015-0546-8"", ""10.1257/jep.14.3.217"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8381.2004.00196.x"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2009.08.004"", ""10.1080/00074918.2016.1184226"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139839082"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262015158.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Demography', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This expression has been used extensively by a galaxy of reactionary forces to thwart the implementation of gender-mainstreaming policies. Recent research has shown that similar anti-gender manifestations have mushroomed across Europe, with discursive elements which recall the Italian anti-gender narrative. This article first sets Italian anti-genderism within a broader transnational movement. Second, through a feminist critical analysis of Italian anti-gender discourse, it shows that ideologia del gender should be interpreted as a new rhetorical device used to reaffirm gender-based prejudice in Italy and other European countries. Third, drawing on the work of Wolfgang Welsch (1999), the paper discusses whether this movement can be interpreted as a transcultural phenomenon, and suggests a transcultural model of culture as the antidote to the anti-gender backlash.","[{""name"": ""Beatrice Spallaccia"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0038038515609024"", ""10.18352/rg.10167"", ""10.18352/rg.10156"", ""10.4324/9780203499627"", ""10.1080/17405900701464816"", ""10.1179/0075163414Z.00000000080""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1017/S1740022820000145,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY,0603 World History,"How global was the age of revolutions? The case of Mount Lebanon, 1821","AbstractThis article addresses the question of the geographical scope of the ‘age of revolutions’ (c.1750–1850) through the case of a peasant uprising in Mount Lebanon in 1821. This uprising had similarities with recent and contemporary revolutions and rebellions, which have led some to suggest the influence of the ideas of the French Revolution of 1789 or the Greek Revolution of 1821. This article argues that influence at the level of ideas was unimportant, but that the similarities can plausibly be traced to similar and connected contexts at the level of political economy, as the expansion and crisis of military-fiscal states provoked opposition ‘from below’ and renegotiations of sovereignty. This focus on political economy rather than genealogies of ideas can then help define an ‘age of revolutions’ extending beyond Europe and the north Atlantic into the Ottoman empire, Latin America, and other regions.","[{""name"": ""Peter Hill"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S1740022820000133,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY,0603 World History,"History, Sovereignty, Capital: Company Colonization in South Australia and New Zealand","AbstractThis article takes a fresh look at the history of private colonial enterprise in order to show how companies influenced British settlement and emigration to South Australia and New Zealand in the 1830s, thus connecting the settler revolution to global capitalism. Bringing into a single analytical frame the history of company colonization in the antipodes and its Atlantic predecessor, it examines how and why the actors involved in the colonization of South Australia and New Zealand invoked North American precedent to justify their early nineteenth-century colonial ventures. The article shows how the legitimating narratives employed by the colonial reformers performed two key functions. On the one hand, they supplied a historical and discursive tradition that authorized chartered enterprise in the antipodes. On the other hand, they furnished legal arguments that purportedly justified the appropriation of Aboriginal Australian and Māori tribal land. In illuminating how language and time shaped the world-making prophesies of these colonial capitalists, the article aims to extend recent work on corporations in global context.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Birchall"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

On the map of his epistolary correspondence, however, England is hardly to be found. What are we to make of this discrepancy? In this article, we demonstrate that the missing letters to England are unlikely to be the result of a data glitch, but rather reflect a lack of interest in contemporary English matters. The only England that Voltaire seems to have cared about lay in the past, during the reign of Charles II. Moreover, this period of English history was (in his view) intrinsically French, given the English monarch's close ties to Versailles. Voltaire's limited admiration of English thought, accordingly, formed part of his broader philosophy of history, which was centered at the court of Louis XIV.","[{""name"": ""DAN EDELSTEIN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""BILIANA KASSABOVA"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226591506.001.0001"", ""10.1093/frebul/ktv006"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226184500.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1754-0208.2000.tb00574.x"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780199688357.001.0001"", ""10.7591/9781501742255"", ""10.1017/CCOL9780521849739.011"", ""10.1177/004724417700702601"", ""10.3917/rhlf.123.0653"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226749471.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/ssh.2020.42,SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY,0603 World History,Generations of Veterans: Socioeconomic Attainment from World War II to the Contemporary Era,"AbstractScholars have long examined how generations or, more technically, cohorts produce social change. According to theory, people’s lives are shaped by the years in which they were born because they experience, along with their peers, particular historical events at the same points in the life course. Despite the importance of history, however, many scholars have evaluated cohorts not defined by clear start and end dates, but rather by arbitrary cut points, such as five-year intervals. In contrast, this article uses defined changes in military service in the United States stemming from shifts between war and peace, and from draft to volunteer service to assess how cohorts have contributed to change in socioeconomic attainment. It uses the Current Population Survey from 1971 to 2017, which has not previously been used to evaluate how veteran status may have produced shifting outcomes across cohorts. It finds evidence that cohorts had different average income overall and between groups, with veterans earning more money than nonveterans who were eligible to serve during the draft era before the Vietnam War. These gaps are partially explained by racial and educational differences. The findings provide a model for analyses of changes in the relative status of other groups, as well as information about how the role of military service in social mobility changed historically.","[{""name"": ""Alair MacLean"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Meredith Kleykamp"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.07.014"", ""10.1016/S0049-089X(03)00041-3"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.12.017"", ""10.4135/9781483348919.n8"", ""10.2307/2657263"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.09.080183.001013"", ""10.1111/j.0081-1750.2004.00148.x"", ""10.1086/342012"", ""10.1007/s11186-007-9028-y"", ""10.1006/ssre.1996.0001"", ""10.2307/145867"", ""10.1515/9781400845569-004"", ""10.1177/000312240807300202"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2753.2006.00711.x"", ""10.2307/20040987"", ""10.1093/geronb/58.6.S327"", ""10.3917/rfs.544.0665"", ""10.1037/11054-000"", ""10.1177/0095327X10390463"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2007.03.002"", ""10.1093/geronb/56.1.S56"", ""10.1177/0730888496023002005"", ""10.1093/sf/sot156"", ""10.1257/aer.96.3.461"", ""10.2307/2095027"", ""10.1086/381902"", ""10.1353/sof.2005.0021"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-03483-1"", ""10.1086/298344"", ""10.1525/sp.2013.12074"", ""10.1086/219845"", ""10.1126/science.159.3810.56"", ""10.1207/s15327876mp0304_3"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.32.061604.123127"", ""10.1177/0095327X0303000103"", ""10.1198/016214507000001247"", ""10.2307/2090964"", ""10.1007/s13524-013-0243-z"", ""10.1257/aer.101.3.334"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7295.2009.00233.x"", ""10.1177/2378023116669726"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195182286.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.esr.a018261"", ""10.2307/2505170"", ""10.1177/0003122410374085"", ""10.1007/s12147-013-9113-7"", ""10.1086/512712"", ""10.2307/2094332"", ""10.2307/2096353"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.34.040507.134627"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2003.09.007"", ""10.1162/003355303321675482"", ""10.2307/2095556"", ""10.1086/228904""]","['Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Only few shed light on the contents that constitute these identities in the minds of Europeans. As different meanings of national and European identity are connected to different consequences such as hostile attitudes toward immigrants or Euroskepticism, reviewing attempts to measure these contents in existing cross-national surveys seems to be promising. This research note summarizes relevant literature on whether and which different forms of national and European identity have been found empirically, which specific contents constitute them, and which determinants and consequences of them are relevant. By comparing articles relying on cross-national survey data since 1995, it will be shown that the field of forms of national and European identity involves different operationalizations and numerous methodological concerns. This leads to considerations for further research in the field.","[{""name"": ""Philipp König"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S002238161100048X"", ""10.14361/9783839449493-009"", ""10.1177/1465116519840428"", ""10.1080/15705854.2012.732391"", ""10.1177/019027250907200104"", ""10.1007/s11205-020-02541-2"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2020.102476"", ""10.1177/053901847401300204"", ""10.5964/jspp.v7i1.557"", ""10.1177/0961463X04040748"", ""10.1093/migration/mny005"", ""10.1080/15705850802416838"", ""10.1080/15705854.2010.524403"", ""10.1080/14608944.2019.1694497"", ""10.1177/1088868309344412"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00329"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000409"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edm015"", ""10.1111/j.1354-5078.1999.00281.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199747672.013.0007"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511750717"", ""10.1017/S1049096504004585"", ""10.5771/9783845266152-300"", ""10.1177/1465116520980068"", ""10.1080/1369183032000170150"", ""10.1057/eps.2012.39"", ""10.1093/ijpor/14.3.303"", ""10.1177/0268580921994517"", ""10.1207/S15327957PSPR0704_07"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2022.102801"", ""10.1080/09668130903063435"", ""10.1017/S0003975600007116"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12337"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edp034"", ""10.4324/9781315746111-2"", ""10.1177/1465116520970280"", ""10.1007/s11615-003-0094-0"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00230"", ""10.1017/S0003975612000033"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199602339.003.0006"", ""10.1177/1468796819834951"", ""10.1080/14792772043000040"", ""10.1080/01419870.2011.556747"", ""10.2307/3791647"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00140"", ""10.1080/13600826.2012.734281"", ""10.1177/000312240907400404"", ""10.1111/nana.12935"", ""10.1080/01419870120112049"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2885.2006.00003.x"", ""10.1080/0090599032000152933"", ""10.1111/nana.12926"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2010.00446.x"", ""10.1017/S1755773913000088"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00885.x"", ""10.1177/0010414002035005003"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1002/ijop.12073"", ""10.4236/ojps.2012.23006"", ""10.1007/s11577-018-0522-1"", ""10.1111/nana.12235"", ""10.4159/9780674258143"", ""10.1080/01419870500352363"", ""10.1177/144078301128756193"", ""10.1177/0958928710374376"", ""10.1007/978-3-663-10003-4_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-322-89577-6_4"", ""10.1007/978-94-024-2014-2_2"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2005.00292.x"", ""10.1080/1369183X.1998.9976644""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Model checkers for hyperproperties thus return, in case a system model violates the specification, a set of traces as a counterexample. Fixing the erroneous relations between traces in the system that led to the counterexample is a difficult manual effort that highly benefits from additional explanations. In this paper, we present an explanation method for counterexamples to hyperproperties described in the specification logic HyperLTL. We extend Halpern and Pearl’s definition of actual causality to sets of traces witnessing the violation of a HyperLTL formula, which allows us to identify the events that caused the violation. We report on the implementation of our method and show that it significantly improves on previous approaches for analyzing counterexamples returned by HyperLTL model checkers.","[{""name"": ""Norine Coenen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raimund Dachselt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bernd Finkbeiner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hadar Frenkel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Hahn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tom Horak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Niklas Metzger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julian Siber"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/CSF.2016.24"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2021.1"", ""10.1145/604131.604140"", ""10.1017/S0960129511000193"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02658-4_11"", ""10.1109/HASE.2010.15"", ""10.1109/CSF.2018.00019"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31784-3_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_5"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.286.1"", ""10.1109/TSE.2004.22"", ""10.1145/1029894.1029908"", ""10.1145/1352582.1352588"", ""10.1023/A:1011276507260"", ""10.1007/BFb0025774"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24730-2_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_15"", ""10.3233/JCS-2009-0393"", ""10.48550/ARXIV.2206.02074"", ""10.1109/LICS.2019.8785713"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54434-1_4"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46520-3_8"", ""10.1145/2663716.2663755"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.CONCUR.2016.13"", ""10.1007/s00236-019-00358-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_11"", ""10.1007/s10703-019-00334-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_8"", ""10.1145/3133956.3134080"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_3"", ""10.1023/B:FORM.0000017718.28096.48"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2017.30"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.MFCS.2021.47"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-07602-7_11"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2020.06.010"", ""10.1007/s10009-005-0202-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-27813-9_35"", ""10.1007/3-540-44829-2_8"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262035026.003.0002"", ""10.1093/bjps/axi147"", ""10.1093/bjps/axi148"", ""10.1109/32.588521"", ""10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114866"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72016-2_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94144-8_26"", ""10.1109/SP.2019.00002"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.MFCS.2018.10"", ""10.1007/s100090050010"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-35873-9_16"", ""10.1504/IJCCBS.2013.056492"", ""10.2307/2025310"", ""10.1145/3357033"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.CSL.2020.29"", ""10.1109/SECPRI.1988.8110"", ""10.1515/9781400882618-006"", ""10.1109/INDIN.2018.8472025"", ""10.1109/SFCS.1977.32"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-31980-1_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30942-8_25"", ""10.1007/3-540-63104-6_19"", ""10.1007/11901914_9""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

We also know little about how internationalist and liberal ideals interacted with notions of racial and national exclusion prevalent in the wider society. To overcome this, this article examines local organizations alongside transnational networks in interwar Hong Kong to understand fully how global trends in the interwar period affected colonial civic culture. Drawing on Freemasonry, Rotary, the League of Fellowship, and the Kowloon Residents’ Association, I discuss the aspirations of multi-racial urbanites in interwar Hong Kong and their limits. I argue that, while internationalism and colonial hierarchies allowed solidarity to be forged amongst multi-racial urbanites and encouraged their civic engagements, racism embedded in the society, rising nationalism, and constitutional constraints put limitations on their aspirations.","[{""name"": ""VIVIAN KONG"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511622175"", ""10.1515/9781400866663"", ""10.1017/S1740022812000010"", ""10.5040/9780755618699"", ""10.1017/9781139814867"", ""10.2307/j.ctvqht4w"", ""10.5790/hongkong/9789888083947.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S135618631100040X"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719066405.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139979474"", ""10.1017/S1740022812000022"", ""10.4324/9781315629377-8"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316257937"", ""10.1017/9781108297615"", ""10.1353/jwh.2011.0080"", ""10.4159/9780674031180"", ""10.5149/9780807889763_appelbaum"", ""10.1017/S0022463400007104"", ""10.5040/9780755625536"", ""10.1017/S1740022812000083"", ""10.4159/9780674029231""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

This article outlines the ways in which this form of literature described a British world united across time and space. The stories have traditionally been read as indicative of a societal fear of invasion, of imperial decline, or of the dangers of revolutionary upheaval. The article argues that the stories’ popularity can instead be traced to the way they included their readers in the experience of invasion and conflict, and how they were well suited to the era of modern mass newspapers. The article therefore concludes that earlier interpretations of how readers engaged with such fiction has underestimated how a varied readership could view the stories as entertaining spectacles where they were invited to participate. As such, the article offers a new interpretation of an important literary genre as well as of British pre-war political culture.","[{""name"": ""CHRISTIAN K.

Baumol and Wallace E. Oates, and the permits market approach proposed by John Dales. This paper describes the early history of the two approaches, and compares them. Although today they refer to different traditions, namely Pigovian versus Coasean, and are often contrasted in the literature, these cost-effective solutions emerged at the same time and for the same reasons. First, they both tried to promote incentives-based policies against traditional regulations; second, they criticized the optimal Pigovian tax, which raised the contentious issue of measuring pollution damage. More broadly, they emerged as a kind of pragmatic compromise, fed by a common attempt to move toward more practical policies: reaching efficiency without optimality, while relying on standards whose setting is a matter for political decision.","[{""name"": ""Nathalie Berta"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/139631"", ""10.1146/annurev.energy.27.122001.083429"", ""10.2307/3439132"", ""10.2307/2227173"", ""10.1177/056943458402800101"", ""10.1086/257497"", ""10.1097/00010694-195809000-00018"", ""10.2307/2229232"", ""10.1215/00182702-4166239"", ""10.1016/0022-0531(72)90049-X"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674421042"", ""10.2307/3439130"", ""10.1080/12265934.2000.9693458"", ""10.1086/466626"", ""10.1215/00182702-32-Suppl_1-1"", ""10.2307/133647"", ""10.2307/2296698"", ""10.1080/09672567.2016.1169304"", ""10.1086/466549"", ""10.2307/2551386"", ""10.2307/133911"", ""10.3197/096327199129341897"", ""10.1017/S1053837214000364"", ""10.1215/00182702-4166335"", ""10.1215/00182702-3-2-278"", ""10.2307/1882231"", ""10.1093/reep/ret020"", ""10.1257/jep.15.3.211"", ""10.1017/S1053837218000366"", ""10.2307/825026"", ""10.1215/00182702-8009583"", ""10.2307/794645"", ""10.1017/S106828050000736X"", ""10.2307/2229670"", ""10.2307/133706"", ""10.1353/jph.2002.0015"", ""10.1086/466560"", ""10.1086/257464"", ""10.3368/le.85.1.3"", ""10.1093/reep/reu018"", ""10.1086/258637"", ""10.1017/S0008423900025282"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-01379-1""]","['Environmental Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)]]"

I examine this archetype, comparing migration from more-eroded and less-eroded counties to distinguish Dust Bowl migrants from other migrants. Dust Bowl migrants were “negatively selected,” in years of education, compared to other migrants who were “positively selected.” Dust Bowl migrants had lower incomes than natives in their destinations, which is reflected in popular impressions. I estimate strikingly modest impacts of the Dust Bowl on average wage incomes in 1939, however, which contrasts with the Dust Bowl’s large and enduring impacts on agricultural land.","[{""name"": ""Richard Hornbeck"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1162/qjec.2010.125.1.417"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2015.04.004"", ""10.1086/383102"", ""10.1257/aer.20200002"", ""10.1093/rsq/hdr006"", ""10.1162/qjec.2010.125.2.767"", ""10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00084-0"", ""10.1257/aer.102.5.1832"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.oep.a041827"", ""10.1073/pnas.1317166111"", ""10.1086/653488"", ""10.3886/ICPSR02896.v3"", ""10.1017/ssh.2016.28"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2016.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2018.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2005.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.05.004"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000074"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2012.02.001"", ""10.1257/aer.102.3.238"", ""10.3886/E192264V1"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000591"", ""10.1162/rest_a_01208"", ""10.1017/S0022050705050023"", ""10.1017/S0022050709001119"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817434"", ""10.1257/aer.102.4.1477"", ""10.1257/jel.20151189"", ""10.31235/osf.io/wm2p3"", ""10.1257/aer.20181026"", ""10.1017/S0022050715001527""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It draws on contemporary sources like official telegrams, governmental reports, letters of American missionaries, and Armenian periodicals to show that observers with otherwise highly conflicting views described the structure of the event in the exact same way: as an outcome of sinister deception. Without exception, all parties told some story of deception to explain the violent attacks of the Kurdish semi-nomadic crowds on the Armenian neighborhoods of the city of Harput. The article analyzes these cases of disguise, deluding, and inculcation to reveal how contemporary observers theorized crowd behavior in general and the atrocities they witnessed in particular. They did not perceive violence as an index of social distance or deep societal divisions.

Given an $$\omega $$-regular winning condition $$\varPhi $$ for the system player, we compute an $$\omega $$-regular assumption $$\varPsi $$ for the environment player, such that (i) every environment strategy compliant with $$\varPsi $$ allows the system to fulfill $$\varPhi $$ (sufficiency), (ii) $$\varPsi $$ can be fulfilled by the environment for every strategy of the system (implementability), and (iii) $$\varPsi $$ does not prevent any cooperative strategy choice (permissiveness).For parity games, which are canonical representations of $$\omega $$-regular games, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for the symbolic computation of adequately permissive assumptions and show that our algorithm runs faster and produces better assumptions than existing approaches—both theoretically and empirically. To the best of our knowledge, for $$\omega $$-regular games, we provide the first algorithm to compute sufficient and implementable environment assumptions that are also permissive.","[{""name"": ""Ashwani Anand"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kaushik Mallik"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Satya Prakash Nayak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anne-Kathrin Schmuck"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_15"", ""10.1007/s00236-016-0273-2"", ""10.1145/3372020.3391557"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-85361-9_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_57"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15375-4_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-13188-2_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-12002-2_16"", ""10.1109/TSE.2021.3101818"", ""10.1145/3368089.3409737"", ""10.7146/dpb.v11i146.7420"", ""10.1109/TCAD.2020.3012641"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17465-1_13"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2019.00106"", ""10.1007/11609773_24"", ""10.1109/REW.2017.14""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"
10.1017/jch.2019.1,JOURNAL OF CHINESE HISTORY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,Coerced Migration and Resettlement in the Qin Imperial Expansion,"AbstractDuring the century of massive expansion of the Qin state in China (ca. 316–222 BCE), and the subsequent fifteen years of the empire (221–207 BCE), it is recorded that millions of persons were forcibly relocated and resettled throughout the empire and along its frontiers. For example, the historian Sima Qian (ca. 145–86 BCE) states that in just the years between 213 and 210 BCE, the First Emperor relocated more than a million people from interior counties of the empire to settle newly-conquered lands on the northern and southern frontiers. Yet this was only one type of forced resettlement carried out by the Qin. The Qin state also relocated thousands of aristocratic households from conquered states to the Qin capital of Xianyang, captured large numbers of non-Chinese peoples and assigned them to localities as slaves to open up agricultural land, exiled wealthy iron industrialists from the interior to the periphery, intentionally expelled the entire populations of conquered cities to replace them with amnestied criminals, and pooled and redirected the labor of convicts gathered from throughout the empire to labor on huge projects such as the First Emperor's tomb. This article seeks to analyze and categorize these various Qin forced resettlements to uncover the ideological and policy motivations behind them and the role they played in the larger project of Qin imperial expansion and colonization.","[{""name"": ""Anthony J.

To keep software verification tools up to date with these advances, tool developers keep on integrating newly designed methods into their tools, almost exclusively by re-implementing the method within their own framework. While this allows for a conceptual re-use of methods, it nevertheless requires novel implementations for every new technique.In this paper, we employ cooperative verification in order to avoid re-implementation and enable usage of novel tools as black-box components in verification. Specifically, cooperation is employed for the core ingredient of software verification which is invariant generation. Finding an adequate loop invariant is key to the success of a verification run. Our framework named CoVEGI allows a master verification tool to delegate the task of invariant generation to one or several specialized helper invariant generators. Their results are then utilized within the verification run of the master verifier, allowing in particular for crosschecking the validity of the invariant. We experimentally evaluate our framework on an instance with two masters and three different invariant generators using a number of benchmarks from SV-COMP 2020. The experiments show that the use of CoVEGI can increase the number of correctly verified tasks without increasing the used resources.","[{""name"": ""Jan Haltermann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Heike Wehrheim"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/ASE.2019.00121"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_20"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950351"", ""10.1145/2786805.2786867"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_16"", ""10.1145/2393596.2393664"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16722-6_23"", ""10.1145/3180155.3180259"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_8"", ""10.1016/S0065-2458(03)58003-2"", ""10.1145/781131.781153"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-18275-4_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-48288-9_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-32759-9_13"", ""10.1145/2884781.2884843"", ""10.1145/876638.876643"", ""10.1145/1062455.1062533"", ""10.1145/1348250.1348254"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46675-9_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49122-5_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-23702-7_26"", ""10.1145/1985793.1985971"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02658-4_48"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2"", ""10.1145/964001.964021"", ""10.1145/503272.503279"", ""10.1145/2632362.2632372"", ""10.1007/s00165-014-0326-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_14"", ""10.1145/263699.263712"", ""10.1145/3338906.3338915"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-30579-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17465-1_22""]",['Computer Science'],"['Software', 'Information Systems', 'Signal Processing']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7598), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7575)]]"

Typically, historians accord business growing influence after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, coincident with the rise of a market-oriented sustainable development paradigm. In this article, we highlight the considerable involvement of self-styled business actors in the formative 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment and subsequent establishment of the UN Environment Programme. Tracing the interconnected networks of British economist Barbara Ward, Italian industrialist Aurelio Peccei and Canadian oilman-turned-UNEP boss Maurice Strong, we identify business actors as key in the passage from ‘planetary’ to ‘global’ environmental rationales characteristic of environmental politics between the 1970s and 1990s. However, we also show that business was a sought-after (even if often ambiguous) partner in the 1970s’ moment of innovative ‘planetary’ environmental thinking and institution making. The contested status of MNCs in 1970s internationalism shaped this early business involvement in the history of environmental governance.","[{""name"": ""Ben Huf"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Glenda Sluga"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sabine Selchow"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Environmental Science', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

Algorithms and tools are usually developed for a specific model, hindering their applications to similar problems originating from other computational systems. A prominent example of such a situation is the area of formal verification and testing for hardware and software systems. The two research communities share common theoretical foundations and solving methods, including satisfiability, interpolation, and abstraction refinement. Nevertheless, it is often demanding for one community to benefit from the advancements of the other, as analyzers typically assume a particular input format. To bridge the gap between the hardware and software analysis, we propose Btor2C, a translator from word-level sequential circuits to C programs. We choose the Btor2 language as the input format for its simplicity and bit-precise semantics. It can be deemed as an intermediate representation tailored for analysis. Given a Btor2 circuit, Btor2C generates a behaviorally equivalent program in the language C, supported by many static program analyzers. We demonstrate the use cases of Btor2C by translating the benchmark set from the Hardware Model Checking Competitions into C programs and analyze them by tools from the Intl. Competitions on Software Verification and Testing. Our results show that software analyzers can complement hardware verifiers for enhanced quality assurance: For example, the software verifier VeriAbs with Btor2C as preprocessor found more bugs than the best hardware verifiers ABC and AVR in our experiment.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Po-Chun Chien"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nian-Ze Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/IEEESTD.2006.99495"", ""10.1109/ASE.2019.00121"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-79379-1_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24756-2_1"", ""10.1145/378795.378846"", ""10.1145/503272.503274"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_11"", ""10.1109/MIS.2014.3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99429-7_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7303732"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7551707"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_42"", ""10.1007/s10817-017-9432-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2208.05046"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-34032-1_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-22337-2_27"", ""10.35011/fmvtr.2007-1"", ""10.1007/3-540-49059-0_14"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2017.8102233"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_5"", ""10.1145/1512464.1512472"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_22"", ""10.1007/3-540-45657-0_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_7"", ""10.1145/876638.876643"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_3"", ""10.7873/DATE.2015.0245"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-23702-7_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_49"", ""10.1145/503272.503291"", ""10.1145/3238147.3240481"", ""10.1007/s10009-015-0407-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-20652-9_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_23"", ""10.1007/3-540-63166-6_10"", ""10.1109/IWRSP.2000.855208"", ""10.1145/964001.964021"", ""10.1145/503272.503279"", ""10.3850/9783981537079_0765"", ""10.1145/1592434.1592438"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-11486-1_14"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-3190-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-45069-6_1"", ""10.1007/11817963_14"", ""10.1109/ICEET1.2018.8338617"", ""10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.107"", ""10.3850/9783981537079_0274"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_38"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73370-6_17"", ""10.1007/s10515-020-00270-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_26""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

Site formation and temporal depth at Catalhoyuk and Tell Sabi Abyad,"AbstractSpatial continuity of the house is often seen as crucial in providing temporal depth for the Neolithic societies of southwest Asia. While an emphasis on the creation of such continuities is evinced at densely agglomerated sites, other sites are characterised by dispersal and frequent relocation of habitation. Çatalhöyük (Turkey) and Tell Sabi Abyad (Syria) appear to be at either end of this spectrum. However, recently found evidence and reinterpretation of older evidence call into question the apparently stark distinction between the two sites. The purpose of this paper is to compare aspects of the archaeological evidence from Tell Sabi Abyad and Çatalhöyük, and in doing so to understand the different ways in which site formation and social continuity were achieved. In particular, the presence of breaks in spatial continuities – an often overlooked aspect of site formation – and its implications are discussed. It appears that at these two sites both continuity and breaks gave form and meaning to the settlements and to the societies that inhabited them. We argue that social continuities and anchors to the past can be constructed in many variable ways, and that direct spatial continuity of the house is but one.","[{""name"": ""Jo-Hannah Plug"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ian Hodder"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter M.M.G.

Due to significant increases in wine consumption among the labouring classes during the years immediately following the First World War, wine, as a general category of beverage, had become closely associated within the minds of many bourgeois and wealthy consumers with the country's popular taverns and saloons, alcoholism and physical and moral ‘degeneration.’ In response, fascist Italy's typical wine growers, merchants and industrialists worked feverishly to rehabilitate the beverage's downtrodden reputation via a series of wide-ranging public relations and collective marketing campaigns during the 1920s and 1930s. By promoting the beverage's hygienic and alimentary qualities, as well as systematically intertwining the moderate consumption of the peninsula's standardised wines with the dictatorship's nationalisation and popular mobilisation programmes, this article will show, the Industrial Wine Lobby successfully re-established ‘wine's honour’ and, simultaneously, recontextualised the country's typical wines as Italy's wholesome, family-friendly, ‘national beverage’.","[{""name"": ""Brian J Griffith"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9781137569622""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It situates Lord Beveridge's Voluntary Action report in its intellectual and social context, through utilizing the qualitative findings of the Mass-Observation district survey of Aston, elements of which were repurposed for the Voluntary Social Services Enquiry from which Voluntary Action emerged. The article takes a thematic approach, investigating how class and religion was seen and reported by Mass-Observers in the context of Aston. Two key arguments are made: that contrary to overarching narratives of post-war secularization, Christian churches actually remained in a relatively dominant position in terms of voluntary action; and that conceptions of voluntary action fundamentally misread working-class understandings of voluntarism, as well as the wider priorities of the post-war working classes. Drawing attention to the importance of class and religion to patterns of voluntary action evident in the Aston survey, yet less considered in historiographical terms, the construction of elite narratives of voluntary action and civil society are more discernible.","[{""name"": ""PHIL CHILD"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780203879436"", ""10.5949/UPO9781846317651"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199671045.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0963926800011378"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwt022"", ""10.1017/S096392681100006X"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206729.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-27012-5"", ""10.2752/147800413X13591373275411"", ""10.1017/S0018246X11000598"", ""10.1057/9781137029461"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198207696.001.0001"", ""10.1093/hwj/1998.45.103"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199691876.001.0001"", ""10.5871/bacad/9780197264829.001.0001"", ""10.1093/tcbh/10.4.404"", ""10.1179/0047729X13Z.00000000027"", ""10.4324/9780203500651"", ""10.1080/13619462.2018.1455031"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511586378"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hws009"", ""10.1017/S0018246X15000515"", ""10.1177/0022009405051556"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198227601.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206859.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1002/johs.12355,JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,Are We Still Dependent? Academic Dependency Theory After 20 Years,"AbstractAcademic dependency theory has attracted increasing attention in academia in the last two decades, especially during the last decade. Syed Farid Alatas, a Singapore‐Malaysia based sociologist, has contributed significantly to the popularization of the idea of academic dependency through theorizing and foregrounding the conditions of dependency in Western‐dominated knowledge production and the global division of academic labor. The growing importance of this idea as applied in Asian contexts is however inseparable from the reconfiguration of the world‐systems in which Asia and especially China have achieved great advancement economically and otherwise. In line with this transformation, we have seen an enhanced effort in Asia and the Global South towards decolonization and indigenization in educational and academic domains. We have therefore organized this special issue to engage critically with Alatas's theory and to rethink the status quo of dependency, decolonization and indigenization in Asia, particularly East Asia, in response to a new development in global and local higher education and research. To close our discussion, we call for an action‐based initiative to address and transform the circumstances of dependency and for more genuine global collaborations.","[{""name"": ""Jinba Tenzin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chengpang Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/00113921030516003"", ""10.4324/9780203093597"", ""10.4159/9780674425293"", ""10.1386/pjss.6.3.137_1"", ""10.1177/0011392116680020"", ""10.1177/0011392120932935"", ""10.1111/johs.12318"", ""10.1086/202279"", ""10.1086/202542"", ""10.1177/026858088003002005"", ""10.1177/0011392111400782"", ""10.1177/0011392119869051"", ""10.1177/0011392113499739"", ""10.1177/0268580909351324"", ""10.4324/9781315584881"", ""10.1515/9780804793445"", ""10.1163/156853181X00075"", ""10.1163/24688800-20201157"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511570896"", ""10.1177/0011392117704242"", ""10.1177/0268580999014002002"", ""10.2307/466216"", ""10.1177/0011392114556595""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

While everyone is fighting to lead in this technology, their readiness differs and adoption challenges arise in many sectors. These competitions also result in various economic impacts on countries, firms, and individuals. This paper uses a systematic literature review to analyze the existing economic impact of AI adoption and the technology used. Overall, this paper presents clear evidence that AI adoption has a large effect on an economy. Findings of this research help researchers and practitioners to identify important economic impacts of adopting AI, identify directions for future research, and set policies that need to be put in place.","[{""name"": ""Rene Kabalisa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jörn Altmann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1609/aaai.v34i08.7056"", ""10.1126/science.aao1733"", ""10.1108/DPRG-08-2018-0039"", ""10.1080/17538963.2019.1681201"", ""10.4301/S1807-1775201815004"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-55180-3_11"", ""10.1002/jsc.2413"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120420"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-47355-6_21"", ""10.1108/TG-05-2019-0031"", ""10.3390/su13020871"", ""10.1109/HNICEM48295.2019.9072725"", ""10.2478/izajolp-2019-0004"", ""10.5755/j01.eis.1.14.26143"", ""10.3390/su12093604"", ""10.1016/j.future.2017.04.040"", ""10.1108/ER-12-2019-0452"", ""10.1109/tem.2019.2949023"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61075-3_105"", ""10.1016/j.jik.2019.01.005"", ""10.22452/ajba.vol13no1.8"", ""10.1080/09537325.2020.1813271"", ""10.1109/icABCD49160.2020.9183834"", ""10.1007/s12525-020-00442-3"", ""10.1080/09585192.2021.1879206"", ""10.1109/HNICEM51456.2020.9400025"", ""10.1080/19761597.2016.1253023"", ""10.3233/JIFS-189029"", ""10.18267/j.cebr.219"", ""10.1108/JEA-10-2020-0221"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican0612-50""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Decision Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

However, state-of-the-art techniques mostly rely on structurality of the type system — that weakening, contraction, and exchange are admissible and variables can be used unrestrictedly once assumed. Linear logic, and many related subsequent systems, provide motivations for breaking some of these assumptions.We present a framework for mechanising the metatheory of certain substructural type systems, in a style resembling mechanised metatheory of structural type systems. The framework covers a wide range of simply typed syntaxes with semiring usage annotations, via a metasyntax of typing rules. The metasyntax for the premises of a typing rule is related to bunched logic, featuring both sharing and separating conjunction, roughly corresponding to the additive and multiplicative features of linear logic. We use the uniformity of syntaxes to derive type system-generic renaming, substitution, and a form of linearity checking.","[{""name"": ""James Wood"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Robert Atkey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/292540.292555"", ""10.1145/3408972"", ""10.1017/S0956796820000076"", ""10.1145/3209108.3209189"", ""10.1007/BFb0022251"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_19"", ""10.1145/357766.351262"", ""10.1109/LICS.1999.782615"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_18"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(87)90045-4"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.FSCD.2017.25"", ""10.2307/421090"", ""10.1145/3342537"", ""10.1145/2692915.2628160"", ""10.1145/1932681.1863568"", ""10.1145/3372885.3373818"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.353.10"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5920051""]",['Computer Science'],"['Software', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

The Arab-Asian group was the earliest manifestation of institutional cooperation among postcolonial nations after 1945. Initially comprised of twelve Arab and Asian UN member-states, the Arab-Asian group coordinated their diplomatic activities as part of an effort to bring national self-determination to the forefront of international debate. However, the emergence of the Arab-Asian group at the UN revealed a confluence of different political ideologies and approaches to decolonization in the early postwar era. Forging a network of postcolonial elites brought out divergent visions for the postwar international order, illustrated by the frictions within the Arab-Asian group even as it played key roles in the UN debates on the questions of Indonesia, the former Italian colonies in Africa, and the Korean War. The Arab-Asian group, an important antecedent to Afro-Asianism, Third Worldism, and non-alignment, encountered challenges over parallel projects pursued by its members, such as Carlos Romulo’s campaign for a Pacific Pact among non-communist Asian states or Jawaharlal Nehru’s articulation of neutralism. Therefore, while postwar international organizations were a formative setting for the emergence of postcolonial internationalism and South-South solidarity, the common goals pursued by these states did not always translate into uniformity or consensus on decolonization.","[{""name"": ""Cindy Ewing"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['History'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

Jamaican responses to Mau Mau varied dramatically by class: for members of the middle and upper classes, Mau Mau represented the worst of potential visions for a route to black liberation. But for marginalized Jamaicans in poorer areas, and especially Rastafari, Mau Mau was inspirational and represented an alternative method for procuring genuine freedom and independence. For these people, Mau Mau epitomized a different strand of pan-Africanism that had most in common with the ideas of Marcus Garvey. It was most closely aligned with, and was the forerunner of, Walter Rodney, Stokely Carmichael, and Black Power in the Caribbean. Theirs was a more radical, violent, and black-focused vision that ran alongside and sometimes over more traditional views. Placing Mau Mau in the Jamaican context reveals these additional levels of intellectual thought that are invisible without its presence. It also forces us to rethink the ways we periodize pan-Africanism and consider how pan-African linkages operated in the absence of direct contact between different regions.","[{""name"": ""Myles Osborne"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00138390008691286"", ""10.9783/9780812294774"", ""10.1093/ahr/118.1.130"", ""10.1080/00086495.2010.11672381"", ""10.5040/9781474218788"", ""10.1353/jwh.0.0018"", ""10.1215/01636545-4355133"", ""10.1080/10999940802115419"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469633596.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13698010120117442"", ""10.2307/2651808"", ""10.2307/2572834"", ""10.1057/9781137352026"", ""10.1093/0195133765.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195332025.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13698010120117389"", ""10.1080/00086495.2013.11672484"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-0570-8_2"", ""10.1215/9780822372936"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674065246"", ""10.5149/9780807838136_putnam"", ""10.1017/S002185371400067X""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0009640721001451,CHURCH HISTORY,0603 World History; 0101 Philosophy,"Writing the Jews out of History: Pseudo-Hegesippus, Classical Historiography, and the Codification of Christian Anti-Judaism in Late Antiquity","AbstractScholarly narratives of the development of Christian anti-Jewish thinking in antiquity routinely cite a number of standard, well-known authors: from Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Justin Martyr in earlier centuries to Eusebius, John Chrysostom, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine in the fourth and early fifth centuries. The anonymous author known as Pseudo-Hegesippus, to whom is attributed a late fourth-century Latin work called On the Destruction of Jerusalem (De Excidio Hierosolymitano), rarely appears in such discussions. This has largely to do with the fact that this text and its author are effectively unknown entities within contemporary scholarship in this area (scholars familiar with Pseudo-Hegesippus tend to be specialists in medieval Latin texts and manuscripts). But “Pseudo-Hegesippus” represents a critical contribution to the mosaic of Christian anti-Jewish discourse in late antiquity. De Excidio's generic identity as a Christian piece of classical historiography makes it a unique form of ancient anti-Jewish propaganda. This genre, tied to De Excidio's probable context of writing—the wake of the emperor Julian's abortive attempt to rebuild the Jerusalem Temple, resurrect a robust Judaism, and remove Christians from public engagement with classical culture—renders De Excidio an important Christian artifact of both anti-Judaism and pro-classicism at the same time. This article situates Pseudo-Hegesippus in a lineage of Christian anti-Jewish historical thinking, argues that De Excidio codifies that discourse in a significant and singular way, frames this contribution in terms of its apparent socio-historical context, and cites De Excidio's later influence and reception as testaments to its rightful place in the history of Christian anti-Judaism, a place that modern scholarship has yet to afford it. As a piece of classical historiography that mirrors not Christian historians—like Eusebius and others—but the historians of the broader “pagan” Greco-Roman world—like Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Sallust, Livy, and Tacitus—De Excidio leverages a cultural communicative medium particularly well equipped to undergird and fuel the Christian historiographical imagination and its anti-Jewish projections.","[{""name"": ""Carson Bay"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1525/9780520957985-013"", ""10.1017/9781316591284"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199687725.003.0008"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521772488.040"", ""10.1163/9789004493599""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Religious studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/ssh.2020.32,SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY,0603 World History,"Working with Husband? ""Occupation's Wife"" and Married Women's Employment in the Censuses in England and Wales between 1851 and 1911","AbstractWomen played a vital role in British industrialization. However, studies of women’s work are often hindered by data limitation. The British censuses provide an unparalleled opportunity to study women’s work and its impact systematically. However, the reliability of the census recording of female employment is still under debate. This articles aims to contribute to this ongoing debate by examining a particular census recording concerning married women who were supposedly working with their husbands, that is “occupation’s wife.” By analyzing a new source of big data, namely 100 percent sample of Census Enumerators’ Books and published census reports, this article shows that the recording of “occupation’s wife” was not informative about the level of married women’s labor in the form of working together with their husbands in the same trade. Given the important fact that married women recorded as “occupation’s wife” constituted the largest group of married women with any occupational titles in the censuses, the results presented in this article suggest a reassessment of some of the empirical foundations in the studies of married women’s work.","[{""name"": ""Xuesheng You"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/03071028808567709"", ""10.1515/9781846151507"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818196"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495779"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198204008.001.0001"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2014.968181"", ""10.1017/S0018246X9300001X"", ""10.2307/2597872"", ""10.1111/ehr.12876"", ""10.1093/hwj/21.1.113"", ""10.1017/S0022050700035701"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00648.x"", ""10.1057/fr.1981.2"", ""10.1080/03071028608567640"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198282969.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2598407"", ""10.1093/hwj/23.1.59"", ""10.1093/past/130.1.142"", ""10.1093/hwj/35.1.22"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbw001"", ""10.1093/hwj/35.1.78"", ""10.2307/2979155"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00585.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-24456-0"", ""10.1080/13545701.2012.725942"", ""10.1093/past/143.1.167"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195039573.001.0001"", ""10.1093/past/152.1.157"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00185"", ""10.3366/hac.1998.10.1-3.17"", ""10.1017/S0010417500015826"", ""10.1111/ehr.12661""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This Albanian-led resistance movement emerged during the early 1990s with the principal goal of building a parallel state, seeking independence from Serbia, and offering means of survival for the population. This project required the participation of all Albanian citizens, and although the participation of women was massive, this has gone largely unrecognized. This article will explore the principal features of women’s participation and activism within this movement, what kind of gendered dynamics were developed, and the principal forms of resistance they encountered against their full and active participation through an analysis of women’s activism both within the Women’s Forum of the Democratic League of Kosovo and within independent women’s organizations.","[{""name"": ""Itziar Mujika Chao"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/wentk/9780195376739.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9780691219653"", ""10.1080/00905992.2017.1371683"", ""10.1080/0090599042000296131"", ""10.1515/9781626372641-016"", ""10.4324/9780203087145"", ""10.1080/00905992.2013.767792""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The Local Effects of Hydropower Technology Adoption in Norway,"This paper studies the impact of the construction of hydropower facilities on labor market outcomes in Norway at the turn of the twentieth century (1891–1920). The sudden breakthrough in hydropower technology provides a quasi-experimental setting, as not all municipalities had suitable natural endowments and the possible production sites were often located in remote areas. We find that hydropower municipalities experienced faster structural transformation and displayed higher occupational mobility. We interpret this as evidence that this early twentieth-century technology was skill biased, as workers in the new skilled jobs were recruited from a broad segment of the population.","[{""name"": ""Stefan Leknes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jørgen Modalsli"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.eeh.2013.04.002"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt034"", ""10.1257/aer.101.7.3078"", ""10.1017/S002205070600026X"", ""10.1257/aer.103.4.1109"", ""10.1086/682289"", ""10.1257/000282806777212620"", ""10.1162/rest.90.4.683"", ""10.1257/jel.40.1.7"", ""10.1111/sjoe.12196"", ""10.1086/498123"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000050"", ""10.1080/03585520902799638"", ""10.1162/003355398555720"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2009.04.004"", ""10.3886/E115804V1"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3246895"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2015.09.002"", ""10.1162/qjec.122.2.601"", ""10.1017/S0022050700096418"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0084.1987.mp49004006.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02402.x"", ""10.1017/S002205071600098X"", ""10.1257/aer.99.2.58"", ""10.1257/aer.104.8.2509"", ""10.1017/S0022050715001540"", ""10.1257/aer.102.5.1832""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Demography', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

These were the questions at the crux of a public debate in 1933 in Hong Kong sparked by a British resident claiming to have formed an organization for the “protection and advancement” of the “British white race.” This article explores how anxieties about fascism, white privilege, and “others” in the empire allowed the very idea of such a political movement to be elevated to the subject of heated debate. The discussion on British unemployment, poor whites, and European “intruders” in the colony tells us less about the actual socioeconomic conditions that Hong Kong Britons faced than about their subjective experience of being “British” in an imperial context. The articulation of imperial anxiety also shows us how the fluid, ambiguous borders of whiteness and Britishness were negotiated at the intersections of nationalism, ethnicity, class, and race. Highlighting the global perspectives demonstrated in the debate and the various transnational networks across Hong Kong, this article argues that the debate was as much about global sociopolitical circumstances as about what was happening in Hong Kong. It therefore offers a timely opportunity to rethink how the local, “national,” regional, and global were interwoven in the “global 1930s,” even among the English reading public in the British colony of Hong Kong.","[{""name"": ""Vivian Kong"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0022463405000020"", ""10.3138/9781487575175"", ""10.4324/9781315200972"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-45136-7"", ""10.1017/S0026749X11000801"", ""10.1080/17450101003665085"", ""10.1093/pastj/gts026"", ""10.1080/03086534.2016.1227032"", ""10.4324/9780203973431"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199640362.001.0001"", ""10.1353/cch.2013.0029"", ""10.2307/j.ctvqht4w"", ""10.1163/9781684171491"", ""10.1080/03086537908582525"", ""10.4324/9781315636856-8"", ""10.1525/9780520928763"", ""10.1017/S0010417500015693"", ""10.1093/past/159.1.161"", ""10.1080/03086530902757688"", ""10.5790/hongkong/9789888208449.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S001041750001793X"", ""10.1080/09612020000200242"", ""10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00189.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805868"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316257937"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976346"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139979474"", ""10.1177/0021989409359547"", ""10.1057/9780230205147_15"", ""10.1057/9780230505537"", ""10.1177/002200948401900401"", ""10.1057/9780230282674_7"", ""10.1111/rec3.12142"", ""10.1080/13619462.2016.1144509"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-19592-3"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199297672.003.0010"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199697700.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09612020000200242"", ""10.4324/9781315756998"", ""10.5040/9780755619542"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719066405.001.0001"", ""10.1353/jwh.2010.0006"", ""10.5040/9780755618699"", ""10.1086/386013""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

While studies in the 1990s indicated relatively positive attitudes between the different ethnic and linguistic groups, it has not been analyzed systematically how these attitudes have developed over time. Such an analysis contributes to our general understanding as to how war and nation-building politics affect attitudes toward minorities. Analyzing survey data from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology from 1995 to 2018 using multivariate statistical methods, I show that the prejudice toward Russian-speaking Ukrainians – measured using the social distance scale – has increased since 2014, when both the war and Poroshenko’s presidency began, although the rise is rather small. A likely explanation to this phenomenon is the perceived link between Russian speakers and Russia as the aggressor in the war. The fact that Yushchenko’s presidency (2006–2009) did not result in a similar increase of negative sentiments, despite similarities between Yushchenko’s and Poroshenko’s identity politics, allows me to suggest that the higher level of prejudice under Poroshenko cannot be solely explained by the political rhetoric promoting an ethnic Ukrainian identity. However, the interplay of political rhetoric and war might have been relevant.","[{""name"": ""Laura Eras"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.29115/SP-2017-0026"", ""10.1111/1469-8219.00009"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1452181"", ""10.1177/1532673X14560809"", ""10.2307/2111381"", ""10.1080/09668139408412161"", ""10.2307/2111529"", ""10.1080/09668136.2017.1379054"", ""10.1111/nana.12235"", ""10.1162/002081800551398"", ""10.1016/j.soscij.2005.03.011"", ""10.1080/10463283.2015.1070018"", ""10.1017/S002238161100082X"", ""10.1080/09668136.2018.1549653"", ""10.1086/669605"", ""10.2307/2657900"", ""10.1177/019027250907200104"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1451232"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2010.07.014"", ""10.1080/0090599042000186179"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00402.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0351.2011.00428.x"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.03.006"", ""10.1002/ejsp.294"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1016/S0147-1767(98)00020-0"", ""10.1080/10758216.2015.1026200"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1451243"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02274.x"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2420250105"", ""10.1177/146879680100100304"", ""10.1086/705926"", ""10.1080/00223980.1947.9917320"", ""10.2307/2095295"", ""10.1002/ejsp.43"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990360"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000373"", ""10.1515/9786155225468-007"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2016.09.017"", ""10.1080/014198700750018388"", ""10.1002/ejsp.504"", ""10.1080/13537110208428663"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1452209"", ""10.2307/2785570"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000294"", ""10.1111/socf.12039"", ""10.1080/01419870500465512"", ""10.1017/9781108924153"", ""10.2307/2944882"", ""10.1177/0888325412474684"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2015.12.004"", ""10.1016/S0191-8869(02)00132-0"", ""10.1080/00905992.2012.750288"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043455"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1174980"", ""10.1080/13670050.2015.1115005""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

In Verse, decision making agents move in a map and interact with each other through sensors. The decision logic for each agent is written in a subset of Python and the continuous dynamics is given by a black-box simulator. Multiple agents can be instantiated, and they can be ported to different maps for creating scenarios. Verse provides functions for simulating and verifying such scenarios using existing reachability analysis algorithms. We illustrate capabilities and use cases of the library with heterogeneous agents, incremental verification, different sensor models, and plug-n-play subroutines for post computations.","[{""name"": ""Yangge Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Haoqing Zhu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Katherine Braught"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Keyi Shen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sayan Mitra"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.29007/7dt2"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(94)00202-T"", ""10.1145/3049797.3049808"", ""10.1145/3302504.3311792"", ""10.1145/3302504.3311804"", ""10.1109/DASC55683.2022.9925762"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-06773-0_6"", ""10.1109/CDC42340.2020.9304391"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_27"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-90870-6_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_30"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314633"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_36"", ""10.29007/zkf6"", ""10.1006/jcss.1998.1581"", ""10.1109/ACC.2007.4282788"", ""10.1145/3302504.3311806"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-02003-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-37706-8_18"", ""10.1007/11603009_3"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569938"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(01)00363-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-26287-1_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31784-3_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99524-9_17""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

I argue that post-First World War Middle Eastern and North African revolutionary militancy was closely linked to global networks. The extensive transregional and transimperial circulation of the communist press discussed here traces these close connections. The Communist International represented a novelty as a self-proclaimed centralist worldwide party. Distinctively, it brought together the means and the will to centralize (much of) global radicalism. This argument also serves to locate the early and mid-1920s as a transitional period in the history of left-wing movements: the means provided by a World Party intersected with the network-like structure of the pre-Comintern revolutionary milieux. The article aims to contribute to global history by discussing a regional – Middle Eastern – political current, not as the aggregate sum of its national components, but as a product of a global process.","[{""name"": ""Burak Sayim"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Through an exploration of three strands of extramural convict labour emerging in Copenhagen (1558), Ulm (1561), and Almadén (1566), this interpretative essay argues that this challenge can be furthered by taking a view of Europe's own penal history from which the focus is less on origins and more on how the landscape of punishment evolved through a continuous and largely contingent process of assemblage. In this process, a few key elements – labour, displacement, pain, and confinement – were combined and mixed to different effects in specific contexts. Along with that approach comes the need to historicize the process by relating it to other practices of labour coercion, both within the penal field and outside it.","[{""name"": ""Johan Heinsen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/9789048525942"", ""10.1017/S0020859012000818"", ""10.1017/S0020859018000196"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16018-1"", ""10.1057/9780230596542"", ""10.18574/nyu/9780814709405.001.0001"", ""10.7591/9781501721267"", ""10.1163/9789004316386_014"", ""10.1111/j.1478-0542.2009.00597.x"", ""10.1086/ahr.116.4.1040"", ""10.1515/9780691187686"", ""10.1057/9780230583894"", ""10.2307/j.ctv34wmqw6"", ""10.1163/9789004285026_004"", ""10.1353/jsh/20.3.439"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199211401.001.0001"", ""10.1086/589589"", ""10.5040/9781350000704"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139057554"", ""10.1017/S0020859018000196"", ""10.1080/00223344.2015.1044484"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511551628"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_480818"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139177535.014"", ""10.4000/chs.2128"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139177979""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

However, the consolidation of data in silo’s limits its ability to be reused while also restricting the control that people have over how their data is used. To mitigate these issues, decentralised storage and personal data store technologies have been put forward as an alternative. Such technologies have gained momentum in Flanders (Flanders is the northern part of Belgium) and became a key policy aspect and a driver for innovation. To support the adoption of these technologies, the Flemish government initiated ‘Solid Community’, a platform for academia, governments, citizens and industry to collaborate on the development of Solid, a technology specification for decentralised data storage. Through ten plenary sessions, the potential challenges that relate to the adoption of Solid were discussed within Solid Community. The reports of these sessions were analysed through qualitative content analysis, leading to the identification of four domains in which these challenges can be situated: social, technical, legal and network (ecosystem) challenges. This paper discusses these challenges and contributes to the development of an interdisciplinary research agenda to help shape the framework conditions for the further diffusion of socially robust, ethically justified and legally supported personal data space initiatives in Flanders.","[{""name"": ""Sander Van Damme"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Mechant"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eveline Vlassenroot"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mathias Van Compernolle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raf Buyle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dorien Bauwens"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/22041451.2015.1048039"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08681-1_7"", ""10.1177/1461444819861955"", ""10.1155/2021/2756666"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2015.07.006"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-39296-3_26"", ""10.4135/9781848607941"", ""10.1177/2053951717721935"", ""10.2799/78681"", ""10.1108/TG-01-2017-0007"", ""10.1177/2053951720948087""]","['Social Sciences', 'Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

Initial hopes that national self-determination would reinforce democratization proved misplaced. While that synergy worked well in the Baltic states, elsewhere authoritarian leaders embraced nationalism, while democracies like Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine lost control of parts of their territory to secessionist movements backed by Russia. Each of the post-Soviet states promoted a national language (except for Belarus) and forged a new historical narrative for their “imagined community,” but in most cases they remained multi-ethnic and multi-lingual communities. In recognition of this persisting ethnic diversity, nation-building was accompanied by policies of ethnicity management. The international economic environment was rapidly changing due to globalization, posing new challenges for nation-builders. The gender dimension is important to the new national identities being forged in the post-Soviet space: the categories of race and class, less so. The article concludes with a review of the salient features of each of the newly-independent states.","[{""name"": ""Peter Rutland"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This symbolism is materialised in the practice of conducting public foundation and termination rituals that unified individual memories in space and time, transforming the physical act into a collective memory: a process that contributed to the formation of political and cultural memory. The recent rescue excavations conducted by the Hatay Archaeological Museum at the hinterland site of Toprakhisar Höyük in Altinözü (in the foothills above the Amuq valley) add to the understanding of the practice of foundation and termination rituals during the Middle Bronze Age and how these moments may have contributed to the political and cultural memory of a rural community living away from the centre. The practice of foundation/termination rituals is archaeologically documented by caches of artefacts from votive contexts stratigraphically linked to the construction and termination of a Middle Bronze Age administrative structure.","[{""name"": ""Murat Akar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Demet Kara"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Archeology', 'Paleontology']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7076), ('0709 地质学', 0.7071)]]"

After the Tito-Stalin split in 1948, the soft Yugoslav nation-building project was accelerated. During the 1950s, national Yugoslavism was stimulated in a latent way through language, culture, censuses, and changes in the constitutional and socialist system. By the end of the 1950s, the Yugoslav socialist national idea reached its peak with the 1958 Party Congress. Nevertheless, with the economic crisis in the early 1960s, and the famous Ćosić-Pirjevec debate on Yugoslavism, the Yugoslav national idea declined. This was evident on the level of the personal, national identifications of the Party members, but also in the ideological shift of the Party’s chief ideologue Edvard Kardelj. Yet, the concept of Yugoslavism was redefined in the second half of the 1960s without ethnic or national connotations. Two Yugoslavisms were created: a socialist one propagated by the Party and a national one that lived among the population in small proportions. Although the Yugoslavs were never recognized as a nation, that did not stop them from publicly advocating for their national rights.","[{""name"": ""Tomaž Ivešić"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9780230375253"", ""10.1080/00905990902985637"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511521447.002"", ""10.7591/9781501713323"", ""10.5040/9780755619436"", ""10.2307/2501300"", ""10.1515/9780804779265"", ""10.2307/2096134"", ""10.7591/9781501720833"", ""10.1080/00905992.2014.1002463""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/tam.2020.72,AMERICAS,0603 World History,"The Two, the One, the Many, the None: Rethinking the Republics of Spaniards and Indians in the Sixteenth-Century Spanish Indies","AbstractFor a half-century, the historiography on Spanish Habsburg rule suggested that the crown envisioned Indies society as best divided into two segregated sociolegal groups: the republic of the Spaniards and the republic of the Indians. This model was popularized by the eminent mid twentieth century Swedish historian Magnus Mörner and has since become a foundational concept in the field. However, using extensive archival evidence, this article suggests that the Mörner Thesis of the Two Republics is flawed. Historicizing sixteenth-century uses of the concept of the republic, it finds that contemporaries conceived of a complex social order in which many political communities such as municipalities and groups of petitioners could overlap within larger meta-republics, such as the Indies republic and the Christian faith-republic. It then turns to subjects’ uses of the two republics, noting that this conceptual duality appeared rarely in the petitions of Spanish officials, commoners, Indians, Afro-descendants, and mestizos, and was also rare in royal and viceregal legislation.

The adapter transforms standard verification tasks (from the well-known SV-Benchmarks collection) in a way that can be understood by Frama-C and produces a verification witness as output.

In August of 1947, Council members authorised an ad hoc delegation from the Republic of Indonesia to participate in its discussions concerning the ongoing Dutch–Indonesian conflict. Focusing on the series of developments that led to the Indonesians taking their seats at the table, this article reveals how Security Council procedures and practices could be used to facilitate the decolonisation process. The Council's involvement in the Dutch–Indonesian conflict—and, in particular, the decision to allow the Indonesians to present their case in this international arena—demonstrates that Europeans’ claims of “domestic jurisdiction” over their colonial territories remained subject to negotiation, and that non-European actors could successfully contest these claims in Council chambers.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer L.

Only twelve years later, however, did colonial administrators extend the law to the predominantly African districts in the eastern region of the colony. A reconstruction of the political debates surrounding the law, and its eventual extension, illuminates the relationship between understandings of childhood and race in the Cape. By the late 19th century, the comparison of Africans to children had become the governing metaphor for the “native question”; but this metaphor contained fundamental ambiguities. Debates over the age of consent forced Cape politicians to confront the racial and chronological boundaries of childhood innocence, and thus to articulate more precise theories of racial difference itself. Rural elites upheld a vision of hierarchy calibrated by wealth and social knowledge as well as race. Reformers sought to protect the innocence of white girls, in part to defend against racial degeneration, but disagreed over the inclusion of black girls. Meanwhile, even liberal social purity advocates hesitated to extend the law to the eastern districts, where “native law and custom” seemed not only to offer more protection but also to undermine claims of European superiority.","[{""name"": ""Elizabeth Thornberry"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226081014.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108659284"", ""10.1080/03057079508708433"", ""10.18772/2014067694"", ""10.2307/525576"", ""10.1080/02582470008671911"", ""10.1515/9781400835072"", ""10.1017/S0021853700004497"", ""10.1057/9780230370210_11"", ""10.1353/book.10494"", ""10.1353/hcy.0.0070"", ""10.1017/S0021853711000508"", ""10.1177/0363199015620108"", ""10.1080/03057079608708501"", ""10.1177/095269519500800403"", ""10.1057/9781137380944"", ""10.5040/9798216032007"", ""10.1192/bjp.41.172.71"", ""10.1080/03057070.2011.579435"", ""10.1177/0263276410380942"", ""10.1006/jhge.1997.0073"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139005050"", ""10.1163/221185201X00035"", ""10.1017/S0010417504000064"", ""10.1017/S0021853797006993"", ""10.1080/03057078708708159"", ""10.1080/03057079508708433"", ""10.1080/03057078408708077"", ""10.1017/S0021853700008367"", ""10.1057/9780230626522_2"", ""10.1353/jsh/25.2.255"", ""10.1057/9781403934314_3"", ""10.2307/2169002"", ""10.1080/03057070.2016.1199394""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

While economic historians emphasize the importance of slavery to the South’s economy as the primary factor behind the movement, we demonstrate the important role that political inequality among whites played in facilitating secession. In particular, secession was decided in state conventions, which allowed secessionists to exploit biases to representation and may have been pivotal in Alabama and Georgia.

It does so by examining the Turkish Alevi Opening (2009–2010) and the German Islam Conference (2006–present), two unprecedented official platforms aimed at improving Alevis’ political participation. The study asks why such state-sponsored initiatives came into existence in Turkey and Germany, and why the German Islam Conference has proven more successful from the perspective of Alevis. It argues that even though the diffusion of EU norms and pressure from transnational advocacy networks have increased awareness regarding the Alevi issue, domestic factors have been more salient in the emergence and outcome of these initiatives in both countries.","[{""name"": ""Ayca Arkilic"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ayse Ezgi Gurcan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S002081830707021X"", ""10.1017/S0896634600002879"", ""10.1177/0888325407311796"", ""10.1177/0191453714567492"", ""10.1080/14683849.2011.604214"", ""10.1080/14782804.2015.1038226"", ""10.14361/9783839408353-004"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-27026-9"", ""10.1080/14608944.2016.1244935"", ""10.1057/ap.2014.6"", ""10.1080/14683850601016291"", ""10.1080/18918131.2015.1000053"", ""10.1017/S0020818306060218"", ""10.4324/9780203100660"", ""10.1080/14608944.2016.1247259"", ""10.1080/13530194.2019.1634396"", ""10.1080/13608740500037916"", ""10.1080/14683857.2016.1233663"", ""10.1080/13530194.2019.1569304"", ""10.1080/1350176042000248089"", ""10.1080/14683849.2015.1022722"", ""10.1080/14782804.2015.1056726"", ""10.1017/jlr.2014.18"", ""10.1080/14683849.2016.1257913"", ""10.1177/0047117812455352"", ""10.1080/14683849.2015.1050959"", ""10.1177/0191453714522476"", ""10.1080/09644000701855127"", ""10.3167/9781845454784"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491917.009"", ""10.1080/14683857.2015.1120465"", ""10.1163/9789004234475"", ""10.1163/9789004362031"", ""10.1080/14683840701312195"", ""10.1080/14683840902864028"", ""10.1080/14683849.2017.1300534"", ""10.1111/1468-5965.00353"", ""10.1080/13602004.2015.1019193"", ""10.1080/13642980802069617"", ""10.1163/9789004492356_007"", ""10.1057/9780230510302"", ""10.1515/9780804783095"", ""10.1007/978-3-476-05728-0_14716-1"", ""10.4135/9781848607903.n26"", ""10.7249/RR1681"", ""10.1080/09596410.2015.1045177"", ""10.4324/9780203417508"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2014.935307"", ""10.1080/14608944.2016.1244934"", ""10.1080/00263200500521370"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139108898"", ""10.1080/13642987.2011.560839"", ""10.12942/lreg-2011-1"", ""10.1002/j.1538-165X.2009.tb00664.x"", ""10.1163/9789004492356_016"", ""10.1080/13608746.2011.577956"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691144214.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050289"", ""10.1080/14683840500119536"", ""10.1093/jaarel/lfn033"", ""10.1353/book.16014"", ""10.1080/13608746.2016.1155282"", ""10.1177/095207670201700202"", ""10.1080/01436597.2015.1135732"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748646944.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Contrary to the predominant and simplistic view that the system allowed the landed elites to capture most political rents, we find that members of parliament from constituencies with a higher vote inequality support more liberal policies, gauging their political orientation from the universe of roll call votes cast in parliament during Prussia’s rapid industrialization (1867–1903). Consistent with the characteristics of German liberalism that aligned with economic interests of business, the link between vote inequality and liberal voting is stronger in regions with large-scale industry.","[{""name"": ""Sascha O.

Borders are inflexible, but reality is flexible and fluid. This is augmented in crisis situations. Multi-ethnicity and history run in parallel, as shared cultures often precede and transcend Westphalia and institutionally imposed borders. For cultures with roots in antiquity, top-down established borders appear to lack legitimacy, as these cultures place more emphasis on historical similarities and traditions of peoples. Thus, what is more important: cultural and historical commonalities or institutional top-down constructions? This article examines the impact of the prioritization of top-down ethno-religious homogeneity over lasting conflict resolution. Through an interdisciplinary approach, the article draws a number of hypotheses from the fields of conflict resolution, territoriality, and nation building and tests these hypotheses on the specific case of the 1923 Compulsory Population Exchange (CPE) between Greece and Turkey and the dual role of the Mediterranean as a security bridge or barrier. This article highlights a “how-not-to” scenario in conflict resolution and argues that efforts to form apparent homogeneous nation-states led to short-term, incomplete conflict termination with a lasting impact, while conflict resolution remained elusive.","[{""name"": ""Anastasia Filippidou"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/210077"", ""10.1515/9783112415863"", ""10.1093/ia/iix132"", ""10.1093/jrs/16.1.1"", ""10.1080/00905992.2013.802767"", ""10.1023/B:CRIS.0000024437.30463.84"", ""10.1017/S7777777702000031""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

More importantly, I demonstrate that Rousseau was himself using this lost ancient language to provide a figuration of his own: the “illusory image” of natural man. Through the Second Discourse, men could be persuaded that they were by nature free, preparing the way for a social contract in which they could legitimately give themselves law. This is an image that I argue has been effectively persuasive up to the present day—and our politics, like Rousseau's, thus seemingly rests on figurative foundations.","[{""name"": ""Emma Planinc"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01916599.2020.1791423"", ""10.2307/2111079"", ""10.2307/1768228"", ""10.5840/gfpj19861129"", ""10.2307/2998638"", ""10.1177/1474885118788963""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Philosophy', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This study investigates how agricultural seasonality affected African farmers’ cotton adoption, circa 1900–1960. A contrast between British Uganda and the interior of French West Africa demonstrates that a short rainy season and the resulting short farming cycles generated seasonal labor bottlenecks and food security concerns, limiting cotton output. Agricultural seasonality also had wider repercussions, for colonial coercion, investment, and African income-earning strategies. A labor productivity breakthrough in post-colonial Francophone West Africa mitigated the seasonality constraint, facilitating impressive cotton output growth post-1960.","[{""name"": ""Michiel de Haas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a096466"", ""10.2307/3601299"", ""10.1017/S0022278X98002742"", ""10.1093/ereh/hey027"", ""10.1017/S0022050708000831"", ""10.1126/science.aad9837"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2012.10.001"", ""10.1017/9781782048510"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00409.x"", ""10.1080/20780389.2018.1527685"", ""10.2307/3601218"", ""10.1162/rest.90.3.414"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.12043"", ""10.2307/1779403"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000049"", ""10.1257/jel.52.3.740"", ""10.2307/524470"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00540"", ""10.2307/2227598"", ""10.3886/E149401V1"", ""10.1017/S0021853719001038"", ""10.1111/1477-9552.12427"", ""10.1111/ehr.12377"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a097201"", ""10.1163/156916101750149121"", ""10.2307/2234892"", ""10.1017/S0022050712000630"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2013.07.013"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-43920-0"", ""10.5194/essd-9-927-2017"", ""10.1017/S0022050718000128"", ""10.1017/S0021853700016236"", ""10.1163/9789047406167"", ""10.2307/213104"", ""10.1111/ehr.13022"", ""10.1086/451637"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-24069-2"", ""10.1017/S0022050700048191""]","['Social Sciences', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Soil Science', 'General Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7714), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7605)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7446), ('0909 草学', 0.741)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/S0020859020000140,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,The Expansion of Slavery in Benguela During the Nineteenth Century,"AbstractThis article explores the nature and expansion of slavery in Benguela, in West Central Africa, during the nineteenth century, engaging with the scholarship on second slavery. Robert Palmer, Eric Hobsbawm, and Janet Polasky have framed the nineteenth century as the age of contagious liberty, yet, in Benguela, and elsewhere along the African coast, the institution of slavery expanded, in part to attend to the European and North American demand for natural resources. In the wake of the end of the slave trade, plantation slavery spread along the African coast to supply the growing demand in Europe and North America for cotton, sugar, and natural resources such as wax, ivory, rubber, and gum copal. In Portuguese territories in West Central Africa, slavery remained alive until 1869, when enslaved people were put into systems of apprenticeship very similar to labor regimes elsewhere in the Atlantic world. For the thousands of people who remained in captivity in Benguela, the nineteenth century continued to be a moment of oppression, forced labor, and extreme violence, not an age of abolition.After the 1836 abolition of slave exports, local merchants and recently arrived immigrants from Portugal and Brazil set up plantations around Benguela making extensive use of unfree labor. In this article, I examine how abolition, colonialism, and economic exploitation were part of the same process in Benguela, which resulted in new zones of slavery responding to industrialization and market competition. Looking at individual cases, wherever possible, this study examines the kinds of activities enslaved people performed and the nature of slave labor. Moreover, it examines how free and enslaved people interacted and the differences that existed in terms of gender, analyzing the type of labor performed by enslaved men and women. And it questions the limitations of the “age of abolition”.","[{""name"": ""Mariana P.

Second, our complexity analysis is parametric, and we describe tight upper and lower bounds in each of the problem parameters: the game graph, the objectives of the system components, and the objectives of the environment components. Third, we generalize the definition of rational synthesis, combining the cooperative and non-cooperative approaches studied in earlier work, and extend our complexity analysis to the general definition.","[{""name"": ""Orna Kupferman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Noam Shenwald"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.24963/ijcai.2018/5"", ""10.1145/585265.585270"", ""10.1109/FOCS.2004.68"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2019/220"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-85361-9_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-74407-8_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-30124-0_6"", ""10.1109/SFCS.1988.21949"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-12002-2_16"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2019/47"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2018.02.023"", ""10.1007/s10472-016-9508-8"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-00596-1_14"", ""10.1109/LICS52264.2021.9470616"", ""10.1109/LICS.2019.8785662"", ""10.1109/SFCS.2005.66"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511800481"", ""10.1145/380752.380883"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(81)90110-9"", ""10.1145/75277.75293"", ""10.1016/0022-0000(86)90026-7"", ""10.1609/aaai.v30i1.9878""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

We show that growing attention to new macroeconomic research was a reaction to both mounting external criticisms against the Fed’s decision-making process and the spread of new macroeconomic theories and econometric techniques. We argue that the rise of the number of PhD economists working at the Fed is a symptom rather than a cause of this transformation. Key to our story are a handful of economists from the Board of Governors’ Division of Research and Statistics (DRS) who did not hold a PhD but envisioned their role as going beyond mere data accumulation and got involved in large-scale macroeconometric model building. We conclude that the divide between PhD and non-PhD economists may not be fully relevant to understand both the shift in the type of economics practiced at the Fed and the uses of this knowledge in the decision-making process. Equally important was the rift between different styles of economic analysis.","[{""name"": ""Juan Acosta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Beatrice Cherrier"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/2059-7932.12006"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199218233.003.0017"", ""10.1086/258579"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8992.001.0001"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300105087.001.0001"", ""10.1257/jep.20.4.29"", ""10.1215/00182702-2310989"", ""10.1177/056943459704100103"", ""10.1515/9781400833139"", ""10.1215/00182702-22-3-465"", ""10.1080/1350178X.2018.1529216"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511977046"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3517231"", ""10.1215/00182702-30-Supplement-1"", ""10.1215/00182702-7551852"", ""10.3386/w24650"", ""10.1080/05775132.1961.11469214"", ""10.1215/00182702-7551864"", ""10.1086/258585"", ""10.1515/9781400873500"", ""10.4000/oeconomia.6603"", ""10.1215/00182702-7551876"", ""10.1016/S0167-2231(98)00004-9"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3254387"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2961293"", ""10.2307/1928627"", ""10.1215/00182702-2008-036"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1947.tb00786.x""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)]]"

10.1017/S1479244319000015,MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY,0603 World History,THE ENDURING FORTRESS: THE INFLUENCE OF BRUNO BETTELHEIM IN THE POLITICS OF AUTISM IN FRANCE,"AbstractThis article examines how the work of Bruno Bettelheim remained influential in debates concerning the meaning of autism as well as its treatment in France well after it was marginalized in the United States. The persistence of Bettelheim's work among French audiences speaks to how the French understanding of autism diverged from its conception in the United States thanks to the social and cultural interest in psychoanalysis in French society and the perceived effectiveness of his form of treatment. The conflation between Bettelheim and the psychoanalytic approach to autism meant that advocates for other approaches needed to rebut his influences well into the 1980s and 1990s, which further reinforced his position as a prime representative for the problems of psychoanalysis for parents. The durability of Bettelheim's presence in these debates also underscores the perceived relationship between disability and motherhood in the case of autism and how Bettelheim buttressed that assumption for the French rooted in anxieties about the dangers of bad mothering. Bettelheim's ideas solidified the intersection of intellectual ascendance and social acceptance of psychoanalysis in France and anxieties about motherhood during the emergence of autism within the public discourse.","[{""name"": ""JONATHYNE BRIGGS"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/9781444325461"", ""10.1017/9781139680455"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9566.2007.01053.x"", ""10.1057/biosoc.2014.20"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226771496.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9781137328533"", ""10.3138/9781442681248"", ""10.4324/9780203299500"", ""10.1515/9781400834372"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-45360-6"", ""10.1037/h0061208"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780199207565.001.0001"", ""10.5406/illinois/9780252038372.001.0001""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

Yet, the ties between that system and expansionism have rarely been unwound and studied in detail. Taking the French invasion of Algiers in 1830 as a case in point, this article shows how the Congress system's shared discourses of security and threat perceptions as well as its common practices of concerted diplomacy fostered European imperialism in North Africa. The article emphasizes obscured continuities and understudied multilateral diplomatic efforts. It uncovers the ways in which the post-1815 system decisively shaped the aims, justifications, and execution of the French war against Algiers. European, North African, and Ottoman actors each furthered or contested the idea that the invasion was part of an international legacy dating back to the Congress of Vienna, related to the concerted repression of North African ‘Barbary piracy’. In bringing these connections to light, it becomes apparent that the post-1815 international system cannot be understood in isolation from nineteenth-century imperialism.","[{""name"": ""ERIK DE LANGE"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9780804799294"", ""10.1017/9781139029230"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtq063"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674736252"", ""10.1017/S0018246X17000085"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198221197.001.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520930797"", ""10.1163/9789047404286"", ""10.1017/9781108895873"", ""10.5040/9780755621170"", ""10.3917/mond1.162.0205"", ""10.1093/fh/crz002"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801449758.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139794695""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['History', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

The commercial dynamism of China during the 16th-19th centuries was integrally related to the importation of foreign silver, initially from Japan but principally from Latin America. Yet the significance of imports of Latin American silver for the Chinese economy changed substantially over these three centuries in tandem with the rhythms of China's domestic economy as well as the global trading system. This article traces these changes, including the adoption of a new standard money of account—the yuan—derived from the Spanish silver peso coin.","[{""name"": ""Richard Von Glahn"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/late.1986.0006"", ""10.1017/9789048535446.002"", ""10.1353/jwh.0.0053"", ""10.1257/aer.97.4.1189"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139343848"", ""10.1525/9780520921313"", ""10.1353/jwh.2006.0013"", ""10.2307/2055842"", ""10.21313/hawaii/9780824836436.001.0001"", ""10.1353/late.1987.0013"", ""10.2307/1863529"", ""10.1093/past/95.1.68"", ""10.1353/jwh.2005.0111"", ""10.3406/ahess.1962.420858"", ""10.1017/S0968565008000036"", ""10.1017/S1479591407000575"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-4053-5_5"", ""10.1525/9780520917453"", ""10.1353/jwh.2002.0035"", ""10.2307/1052078"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1tg5q75"", ""10.1215/00182168-81-1-89""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The article argues that intellectual relief, while frequently using the language of the “crisis of civilization,” was part of the broader effort to safeguard the postwar liberal democratic order against Bolshevism. The article pays particular attention to the League of Nations' Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (CIC) to show how states like Hungary used intellectual deprivation to agitate for treaty revision.

To overcome the challenge, we propose an iterative framework for choosing decision attributes, or features, at each level by formulating feature selection as a series of mixed integer optimization problems. Both fairness and accuracy requirements are encoded as numerical constraints and solved by an off-the-shelf constraint solver. As a result, the trade-off between fairness and accuracy is quantifiable. At a high level, our method can be viewed as a generalization of the entropy-based greedy search techniques such as and , and existing fair learning techniques such as and . Our experimental evaluation on six datasets, for which demographic parity is used as the fairness metric, shows that the method is significantly more effective in reducing bias than other methods while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, compared to non-iterative constraint solving, our iterative approach is at least 10 times faster.","[{""name"": ""Jingbo Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yannan Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chao Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011418"", ""10.1145/3133904"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-93031-2_3"", ""10.1145/3360544"", ""10.1007/s10994-017-5633-9"", ""10.4324/9781315263298"", ""10.1201/9781315139470"", ""10.1109/ICDMW.2009.83"", ""10.1137/15M1020575"", ""10.1145/2090236.2090255"", ""10.1145/2783258.2783311"", ""10.1137/1.9781611974348.17"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287589"", ""10.1007/s41019-020-00124-2"", ""10.1109/ICDM.2010.50"", ""10.1109/ICDM.2012.45"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-33486-3_3"", ""10.1145/3278721.3278742"", ""10.1002/int.22354"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59776-8_8"", ""10.1002/0471704091"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2007.12.020""]","['Social Sciences', 'Computer Science']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

Quantitative and qualitative data are reported on user experiences with mHealth apps to map the behavior, interests and needs of people with specific types of disability (physical, cognitive, sensory, emotional/psychological, and speech). Summary results are presented for all respondents and each disability type. Slightly more than half of the participants in this sample (53.2%) reported using mHealth apps. Fitness and exercise apps were the mHealth apps most used by respondents with disabilities, followed by hospital/clinical portal apps. Symptom and disease management apps are the least commonly used, even though these would seem to be important for people with chronic conditions. Text-based responses regarding unmet needs for mHealth apps can be sorted into accessibility needs and functionality needs. In general, respondents with sensory limitations were more likely to identify accessibility needs. However, all disability groups identified both types of unmet needs. These results can help inform research and development efforts to provide mHealth apps that meet the needs of people with disabilities.","[{""name"": ""Ben Lippincot"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicole Thompson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""John Morris"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mike Jones"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frank DeRuyter"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/ijerph15030515"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-05095-9_7""]","['Social Sciences', 'Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Demography', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"

In this study, we investigate how ca. 400 students determine the trustworthiness of false, biased and credible news. We find that students use different strategies depending on what they evaluate. For example, students who fail to debunk a manipulated image often rely on what they see in the image in contrast to students who determine credibility upon what is not in the image. Students finding junk news credible may have special problems separating different kinds of sources. We identify potentials and pitfalls among students important for further investigation, research and a focus on education.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Nygren"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jenny Wiksten Folkeryd"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Caroline Liberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mona Guath"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0163443710393382"", ""10.5210/fm.v16i1.3206"", ""10.1080/00933104.2017.1416320"", ""10.18261/ISSN1891-943X-2012-01-02"", ""10.1080/10714420490280152"", ""10.4324/9780203164754"", ""10.1002/asi.20672"", ""10.2478/nor-2019-0002"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01488.x"", ""10.1108/00220411111145043"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00351.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.03.016"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2018.1547411"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103711"", ""10.1177/0002764216660135"", ""10.1177/1461444818799526"", ""10.1002/asi.20511""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Nevertheless, there is no doubt that it has also given a strong global impetus to the digital world, asserting its importance, sustainability and richness of perspectives. With our work we intend to establish a set of best practices aimed at defining methods and technologies that will enable those fascinated by digital technologies to contribute effectively to the digitisation of cultural heritage on a large scale. Various aspects that play a crucial role in the digitisation of artifacts will be discussed, with a focus on the issues involved in the manual realisation of works using Blender and Unity software. For demonstration purposes, two very popular use cases in the Umbria region of Italy are presented: “Piazza IV Novembre” in Perugia with the magnificent “Fontana Maggiore”, the “Palazzo dei Priori” and the Duomo on one side and the Republic square in Foligno on the other, with the Duomo, the Bishop’s house and the Diocesan Museum, the Town Hall and “Palazzo Trinci”. The first realization was carried out using photogrammetry techniques, the software Blender and Unity, while the second was carried out exclusively with Blender and Unity.The theme is highly relevant in Europe, particularly Italy, where the topic is part of the post-COVID-19 National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP).","[{""name"": ""Osvaldo Gervasi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Damiano Perri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marco Simonetti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sergio Tasso"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1201/9781315365459"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58820-5_57"", ""10.1145/1103900.1103929"", ""10.1007/978-1-84882-935-0"", ""10.1109/CIG.2019.8847959"", ""10.1109/ICCE.2017.7889353"", ""10.1145/3307650.3322247"", ""10.1109/ICCV48922.2021.01408"", ""10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01120"", ""10.3390/rs3061104"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2007.06.003"", ""10.1145/3377143"", ""10.4018/978-1-7998-6428-8.ch013"", ""10.1109/DigitalHeritage.2018.8810097"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58796-3_20"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.892"", ""10.1302/0301-620X.101B12.BJJ-2019-0315.R1"", ""10.1109/ROBOT.2002.1013644"", ""10.3390/mti1020008""]","['Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Conservation', 'Space and Planetary Science', 'Geology']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7451), ('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.7369)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)]]"

However, it was in the Romanian Legionary Movement (also known as the Iron Guard) that these were articulated into a full-fledged ideology of thanatic ultranationalism. In this article, I examine the spectacular fascist necropolitics staged as state-sponsored funeral performances during the short-lived National Legionary State (September 14, 1940–February 14, 1941). A detailed description of the massive campaign of exhumations and reburials of the so-called “legionary martyrs” carried out during this short time span, culminating with the grandiose ceremony organized for the reburial of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu on November 30, 1940, provides insight into the legionary thanatic worldview and ritual praxis. It also sheds light on the movement’s politics of commemoration, death, and afterlife and shows how these were embedded into a religious framework underpinned by theological concepts such as heroic martyrdom, vicarious atonement, and collective redemption.","[{""name"": ""Mihai Stelian Rusu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/07481187.2018.1526830"", ""10.1163/221162512X623601"", ""10.1163/22116257-00201002"", ""10.2752/147800413X13591373275367"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-29844-3_3"", ""10.1057/9780230502093"", ""10.1080/13576270903537716"", ""10.5699/slaveasteurorev2.97.2.0299"", ""10.1177/00220094020370010701"", ""10.1080/14616696.2019.1616795"", ""10.17104/1611-8944_2015_1_79"", ""10.1080/21567689.2016.1232196"", ""10.1177/0001699318806340"", ""10.1080/1469076042000312203"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198203285.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14690760008406923"", ""10.1080/14690760701321163"", ""10.1163/22116257-00502004"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-29844-3_6""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

10.1017/mit.2021.7,MODERN ITALY,0603 World History; 0705 Geography,Socio-ecological colonial transfers: trajectories of the Fascist agricultural enterprise in Libya (1922-43),"This paper intertwines the two historiographical concerns of migration and colonialism by exploring the case of Italian rule in North Africa from 1922 to 1943 and by adopting the analytic ground of the environment. The role played by the environment in targeting and shaping specific social groups, forming and grounding specific policies, creating and preventing social and natural transfers, has been overshadowed until now, particularly in relation to Italian colonialism. This study articulates the Fascist agricultural enterprise in Libya around the watershed event of the colony's 1932 pacification.

This reconstruction contributes to the environmental history subfields of migration and colonialism and invites historians to further explore the first decade of Italian rule in Libya and not to limit historical explorations to the lens of settler colonialism.","[{""name"": ""Roberta Biasillo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9781315731100"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8306.1973.tb00943.x"", ""10.1353/cch.2018.0023"", ""10.2307/j.ctvqsdqp7"", ""10.1179/007516306X142924"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139173599.006"", ""10.3197/ge.2019.120107"", ""10.1111/soc4.12693"", ""10.3197/096734014X13851121443328"", ""10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00093.1"", ""10.1080/1353294032000074052"", ""10.4324/9781003031772"", ""10.1007/978-1-4039-8158-5_7"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262035033.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0263718900002405"", ""10.7591/9781501739910"", ""10.3197/096734013X13690716950064"", ""10.1080/13532944.2014.927355"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469655932.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-1-4039-8158-5_3"", ""10.1177/0022009415606795"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226803487.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811623"", ""10.1080/13532944.2015.1024214"", ""10.2307/211044"", ""10.1080/13532944.2014.925433"", ""10.3197/096734004772444397"", ""10.1057/9780230245099"", ""10.1080/07341512.2018.1548066"", ""10.1177/019791837901300404"", ""10.1080/2201473X.2016.1153251"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2007.09.009"", ""10.3197/ge.2019.120101""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Children and Youth in Colonial Insurgencies and Counterinsurgency, ca. 1945-1960","AbstractChild soldiers are often viewed as a contemporary, “new war” phenomenon, but international concern about their use first emerged in response to anti-colonial liberation struggles. Youth were important actors in anti-colonial insurgencies, but their involvement has been neglected in existing historiographies of decolonization and counterinsurgency due to the absence and marginalization of youth voices in colonial archives. This article analyses the causes of youth insurgency and colonial counterinsurgency responses to their involvement in conflict between ca. 1945 and 1960, particularly comparing Kenya and Cyprus, but also drawing on evidence from Malaya, Indochina/Vietnam, and Algeria. It employs a generational lens to explore the experiences of “youth insurgents” primarily between the ages of twelve and twenty. Youth insurgents were most common where the legitimate grievances of youth were mobilized by anti-colonial groups who could recruit children through colonial organizations as well as family and social networks. While some teenagers fought due to coercion or necessity, others were politically motivated and willing to risk their lives for independence. Youth soldiers served in multiple capacities in insurgencies, from protestors to couriers to armed fighters, in roles that were shaped by multiple logics: the need for troop fortification and sustained manpower; the tactical exploitation of youth liminality, and the symbolic mobilization of childhood and discourses of childhood innocence. Counterinsurgency responses to youthful insurgents commonly combined violence and development, highlighting tensions within late colonial governance: juveniles were beaten, detained, and flogged, but also constructed as “delinquents” rather than “terrorists” to facilitate their subsequent “rehabilitation.”","[{""name"": ""Stacey Hynd"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199592654.001.0001"", ""10.14375/NP.9782200274610"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1dv0trf"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7717.1994.tb00310.x"", ""10.36019/9780813537832"", ""10.1080/02684520412331306790"", ""10.36019/9780813563725"", ""10.1179/0729247312Z.0000000007"", ""10.3917/dec.bance.2003.01"", ""10.1177/0907568201008003003"", ""10.5406/historypresent.3.2.0160"", ""10.1017/S0021853705001672"", ""10.2307/j.ctv224tw99"", ""10.5040/9781350986787"", ""10.14321/jwestafrihist.4.2.0047"", ""10.1111/1468-0424.12210"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139854573"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2006.00416.x"", ""10.1525/vs.2009.4.3.17"", ""10.36019/9780813563725"", ""10.1080/0046760X.2016.1177121"", ""10.3917/polaf.080.0090"", ""10.1163/9789047407003"", ""10.1017/9781108556163"", ""10.1353/jsh.2003.0090"", ""10.1525/vs.2008.3.3.291"", ""10.1515/9781501757440"", ""10.1017/S002074381100119X"", ""10.1017/jbr.2019.243"", ""10.1515/9781501714672"", ""10.1353/book13079"", ""10.1353/anq.2000.0003""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

They allow breaking down large systems into smaller components, while enabling reasoning about the behaviour of the composed system. For concurrent and communicating systems, compositional techniques based on behavioural type systems have received much attention. By abstracting communication protocols as types, these type systems can statically check that programs interact with channels according to a certain protocol, whether the intended messages are exchanged in a certain order. In this paper, we put on our coalgebraic spectacles to investigate session types, a widely studied class of behavioural type systems. We provide a syntax-free description of session-based concurrency as states of coalgebras. As a result, we rediscover type equivalence, duality, and subtyping relations in terms of canonical coinductive presentations. In turn, this coinductive presentation makes it possible to elegantly derive a decidable type system with subtyping for $$\pi $$ π -calculus processes, in which the states of a coalgebra will serve as channel protocols. Going full circle, we exhibit a coalgebra structure on an existing session type system, and show that the relations and type system resulting from our coalgebraic perspective agree with the existing ones.","[{""name"": ""Alex C.

Our proposal is based on the idea that data streams, stream transformations, and stream-processing programs should be classified using types. The type of a data stream is captured formally by a monoid, an algebraic structure with a distinguished binary operation and a unit. The elements of a monoid model the finite fragments of a stream, the binary operation represents the concatenation of stream fragments, and the unit is the empty fragment. Stream transformations are modeled using monotone functions on streams, which we call stream transductions. These functions can be implemented using abstract machines with a potentially infinite state space, which we call stream transducers. This abstract typed framework of stream transductions and transducers can be used to (1) verify the correctness of streaming computations, that is, that an implementation adheres to the desired behavior, (2) prove the soundness of optimizing transformations, e.g. for parallelization and distribution, and (3) inform the design of programming models and query languages for stream processing. In particular, we show that several useful combinators can be supported by the full class of stream transductions and transducers: serial composition, parallel composition, and feedback composition.","[{""name"": ""Konstantinos Mamouras"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s00778-003-0095-z"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2018.2853608"", ""10.1109/TCBB.2018.2885274"", ""10.1186/s40537-017-0072-9"", ""10.14778/2536222.2536229"", ""10.14778/2824032.2824076"", ""10.1145/1926385.1926454"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2019.11.018"", ""10.3233/978-1-61499-810-5-1"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2017.112"", ""10.1145/3290363"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95246-8_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63121-9_4"", ""10.1007/s00778-004-0147-z"", ""10.1145/1031570.1031572"", ""10.1145/543613.543615"", ""10.1145/1183614.1183664"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2002.805826"", ""10.1016/0167-6423(91)90001-E"", ""10.1016/0167-6423(92)90005-V"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-07964-5"", ""10.1109/78.485935"", ""10.14778/1920841.1920874"", ""10.1145/2335484.2335513"", ""10.1145/2461328.2461348"", ""10.1109/5.97299"", ""10.1145/1247480.1247620"", ""10.1007/3-540-10699-5_102"", ""10.1145/41625.41641"", ""10.1145/872757.872857"", ""10.1109/ICDE.2004.1320048"", ""10.1007/11693024_20"", ""10.1016/0890-5401(88)90005-3"", ""10.1007/3-540-45241-9_3"", ""10.1145/872757.872838"", ""10.1145/2491956.2462161"", ""10.1109/TIME.2005.26"", ""10.1007/11687238_38"", ""10.1007/3-540-06859-7_145"", ""10.1007/s10703-017-0286-7"", ""10.1007/s00778-012-0297-3"", ""10.1147/rd.91.0047"", ""10.1145/258948.258973"", ""10.1145/1596638.1596643"", ""10.4153/CJM-1966-040-3"", ""10.1145/2603088.2603095"", ""10.1109/5.97300"", ""10.1007/s10009-003-0117-6"", ""10.1145/2335484.2335506"", ""10.1145/2528412"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-44833-4_6"", ""10.1016/S0167-6423(99)00023-4"", ""10.14778/1454159.1454179"", ""10.1017/S0305004100074338"", ""10.1137/0114108"", ""10.1006/inco.1994.1037"", ""10.1145/256167.256195"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-43951-7_24"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(81)90019-0"", ""10.1016/S0020-0255(01)00164-5"", ""10.1145/1508857.1508861"", ""10.1145/2500365.2500588"", ""10.1109/LICS.2011.38"", ""10.1145/2723372.2742788"", ""10.1145/1966385.1966386"", ""10.1109/TASSP.1986.1164809"", ""10.1109/PROC.1987.13876"", ""10.1016/j.jlap.2008.08.004"", ""10.1145/1066157.1066193"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-30570-5_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39038-8_29"", ""10.1145/2603088.2603157"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46678-0_2"", ""10.1145/2835491"", ""10.2168/LMCS-12(3:6)2016"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54458-7_6"", ""10.1145/3062341.3062369"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314580"", ""10.1002/j.1538-7305.1955.tb03788.x"", ""10.1145/1559845.1559867"", ""10.1145/1640089.1640091"", ""10.1515/9781400882618-006"", ""10.1145/2517349.2522738"", ""10.1145/581690.581695"", ""10.14778/3137765.3137770"", ""10.1145/320924.320930"", ""10.1007/BFb0055624"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(00)00056-6"", ""10.1017/S0960129504004517"", ""10.1145/1005566.1005568"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139195218"", ""10.1109/TC.2013.221"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(77)90055-X"", ""10.1145/1596550.1596558"", ""10.1145/1133981.1134016"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2004.01.029"", ""10.1007/3-540-45937-5_14"", ""10.1145/2588555.2595641"", ""10.1109/TKDE.2003.1198390"", ""10.1145/2103656.2103674"", ""10.1145/1142473.1142520"", ""10.1145/2517349.2522737"", ""10.1145/2934664""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

This article offers some reflections by interrogating discourses (intertextually woven with Sanskritic invocations) produced by three celebrated Bengalis: the nationalist littérateur Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay (1838–94), the Rajavamshi “lower-caste” peasant leader Panchanan Barma (1866–1935), and the international jurist Radhabinod Pal (1886–1967). These actors evidently took part in projects of vernacularizing (and thereby globalizing through linguistic–conceptual translation) legal–political frameworks of state sovereignty. They produced ideas of nexus between sovereignty, law, and “divine” lawgiving activity, which resemble as well as diverge from notions of political theology associated with the German jurist Carl Schmitt. Simultaneously, these actors critiqued coercive impositions of state-backed positive law and sovereign violence, often in the name of globally oriented concepts of “ethical”/natural law, theology, and capacious forms of solidarity, including categories like “all beings,” “self/soul,” “humanity,” and “world.” I argue that “sovereignty,” as a metonym for concrete practices of power as well as a polyvalent conceptual signifier, thus dialectically provoked the globalization of modern legal intellection, including in the extra-European world.","[{""name"": ""MILINDA BANERJEE"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199769230.003.0013"", ""10.7312/moyn16048"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139924306"", ""10.1353/book10186"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781674"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-42987-8"", ""10.2307/469157"", ""10.7312/nove17580"", ""10.1080/13688790.2015.1044485"", ""10.1515/9780804781664"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139015424"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195680836.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226734866.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199278527.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139236980"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804775366.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400835072"", ""10.1111/hith.10746"", ""10.1080/01916599.2012.714635"", ""10.12773/arwh.2015.3.1.081"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226738840.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9781137037015""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"
10.1017/S0020859020000115,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Runaway Slaves in Antebellum Baltimore: An Urban Form of Marronage?,"AbstractThe starting point of this article is the observation that thousands of enslaved people escaped bondage and managed to find refuge in the city of Baltimore between 1800 and 1860. There, they integrated into a large free black community. Given the use of the term “urban marronage” to categorize slave flight to cities in some historical literature, this chapter discusses the concept of marronage and its applicability to the urban context of antebellum Baltimore. It examines individual escapees from slavery, the communities they joined, and the broader slaveholding society to emphasize that the interplay and mutual relations of all three should be considered when assessing the applicability of this concept. Discussing the historiography around marronage and the arguments that speak both in favour of and against applying the concept of urban maroons to Baltimore's runaway slaves, this article ultimately dismisses its suitability for this case.

10.1002/johs.12361,JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,Rethinking the Rise of China: A Postcolonial Critique of China and a Chinese Critique of the Postcolonial,"AbstractThis article is intended to rethink a symbiotic but otherwise inadequately attended relationship between postcolonial studies and Chinese academia at a time when the rise of China evokes epistemic, ontological and empirical challenges for critical reflection. Above all, I argue that China is situated in her postcolonial conditions in such a way that these conditions largely define China's multi‐faceted positioning as colonial agent, (semi‐)colonial victim, recipient of colonialist ideology, overthrower of that ideology and its accompanying world‐system, and contender for the “top place” within such a world‐system. Postcolonial theory hence becomes relevant and productive in terms of its potential to problematize various puzzles, contradictions and tensions during China's rise like widespread disregard of basic civic values, political partisanship in scholarship, aggravation of the East‐West divide and rising Chinese exceptionalism. Additionally, however, this article also pinpoints the need to transform and reshape the oftentimes Eurocentric inclination in postcolonial studies through an incorporation of the revolutionary and post‐revolutionary experiences in China and elsewhere. Doing so therefore calls for a post‐revolutionary paradigm as proposed by Wang Hui, among others. I thus advocate cross‐fertilization, rather than mutual exclusion, not only between the postcolonial and post‐revolutionary paradigms but also between postcolonial studies and Chinese scholarship/academia.","[{""name"": ""Jinba Tenzin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences National University of Singapore Singapore Singapore""]}]","[""10.1017/S0305741011001536"", ""10.1215/9780822399117"", ""10.1215/9780822399117-013"", ""10.1515/9780824876012"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195085792.001.0001"", ""10.2307/303809"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1p9wrd2"", ""10.1080/1369801X.2013.798124"", ""10.1215/01903659-6915545"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226167237.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-52726-6_10"", ""10.1215/01642472-1416091"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190625139.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01436597.2020.1834841"", ""10.1057/9780230601697"", ""10.1515/9780804780995"", ""10.1515/9780804765596"", ""10.1080/10670564.2020.1766911"", ""10.7771/1481-4374.3246"", ""10.7771/1481-4374.3819"", ""10.14506/ca30.3.05"", ""10.1080/13688790.2018.1507620"", ""10.3998/mpub.11357429"", ""10.1007/s11186-019-09373-1"", ""10.2307/20044496"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2019.1662074"", ""10.4324/9780203078082"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11688nq.9"", ""10.1080/14649370600982982"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226590479.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11059-007-2010-x"", ""10.1177/0920203X18760416"", ""10.1057/9781403978448"", ""10.1057/9781137289452"", ""10.2307/466220"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-19059-1_20"", ""10.1177/0920203X17749684"", ""10.1017/S0305741017001059"", ""10.1017/9781108770408"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199588251.013.0023"", ""10.1515/9780822372448"", ""10.1177/0097700419878849"", ""10.1177/0097700419878851"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674061354"", ""10.1057/9781137370358"", ""10.1515/9781400834372"", ""10.1177/0263276410396915"", ""10.7591/9780801469787"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-75435-2"", ""10.1525/9780520974210""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Moreover, most of the literature focuses on Cairo. Seeking to diverge from the trend even further, this article focuses on the memory of the 1977 uprising in the city of Suez, which it explores through the perspectives of leftist activists and others. It aims to understand how the people of Suez who witnessed and participated in the 1977 protests remember and interpret the event today, asking what memory of the uprising means politically on a local level. By exploring the memory of the 1977 protests in Suez, this article traces their effects on the lives of the selected interlocutors, and also on their political actions and interpretations. It follows three memory fragments of the 1977 protests in Suez from three different vantage points: the position of people who were members of political organizations before the protests; the traces of protests in Suez's streets; and the position of those who witnessed the protests from home.","[{""name"": ""Nayera Abdelrahman Soliman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/ngs-2014-0026"", ""10.1080/00141844.1995.9981519"", ""10.1080/19436149.2019.1633055""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The concurrent systems code managing virtual memory has been left on an entirely informal basis, and OS and hypervisor verification has had to make major simplifying assumptions.We explore the design space for relaxed virtual memory semantics in the Armv8-A architecture, to support future system-software verification. We identify many design questions, in discussion with Arm; develop a test suite, including use cases from the pKVM production hypervisor under development by Google; delimit the design space with axiomatic-style concurrency models; prove that under simple stable configurations our architectural model collapses to previous “user” models; develop tooling to compute allowed behaviours in the model integrated with the full Armv8-A ISA semantics; and develop a hardware test harness.This lays out some of the main issues in relaxed virtual memory bringing these security-critical systems phenomena into the domain of programming-language semantics and verification with foundational architecture semantics.","[{""name"": ""Ben Simner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alasdair Armstrong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jean Pichon-Pharabod"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Pulte"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Richard Grisenthwaite"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Sewell"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/TPDS.2003.1199067"", ""10.1145/325164.325100"", ""10.1145/1481839.1481842"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-19835-9_5"", ""10.1145/2627752"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-27705-4_17"", ""10.1145/3290384"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_14"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.TYPES.2013.45"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-21437-0_19"", ""10.1109/CSF.2012.17"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-89330-1_6"", ""10.1145/1926385.1926394"", ""10.1145/2103656.2103717"", ""10.1145/1379022.1375591"", ""10.1145/3062341.3062353"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-03456-5_5"", ""10.1145/2837614.2837615"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009839"", ""10.1016/0743-7315(92)90052-O"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48628-4_8"", ""10.1145/2830772.2830775"", ""10.3233/JCS-160558"", ""10.1109/ISCA45697.2020.00076"", ""10.1145/2560537"", ""10.1109/SP40001.2021.00049"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-03359-9_27"", ""10.1145/3158107"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314624"", ""10.1145/3276507"", ""10.1145/2254064.2254102"", ""10.1145/1993498.1993520"", ""10.1145/1594834.1480929"", ""10.1145/1785414.1785443"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-44914-8_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94821-8_32"", ""10.1007/s10817-019-09539-7"", ""10.1145/3477132.3483560"", ""10.1007/s10817-009-9122-0"", ""10.1145/3037697.3037719"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009838"", ""10.1109/IPDPS.2004.1302944""]",['Computer Science'],"['Hardware and Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Signal Processing']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7598), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7575)]]"

Long assumed to be a casualty of the ‘scientific revolution’ and ‘Enlightenment’, since the 1970s historians have questioned the power of intellectual developments to carry the weight of this major shift, and have constructed alternative social, political, and cultural narratives. However, in the last fifteen years, the field has been making a (re-)turn to intellectual history, albeit in innovative ways. This critical historiographical review accumulates and digests this large body of new work, showing how these historiographical about-turns leave us with broader questions about the role of ideas in cultural transformations, as well as – on a smaller scale – the processes by which individuals change their minds. I close the review by contending that after decades of neglect, it is an opportune time to bring intellectual history back into our studies of the ‘disenchantment of the world’.","[{""name"": ""Michelle Aroney"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3998/mpub.7665"", ""10.1086/388148"", ""10.1353/pgn.2022.0001"", ""10.1086/348412"", ""10.1163/15733823-02256P01"", ""10.1093/past/28.1.41"", ""10.1215/00982601-2010-029"", ""10.1162/106361400568028"", ""10.1016/0083-6656(67)90012-8"", ""10.1163/157338297X00023"", ""10.1163/187124110X545182"", ""10.5962/bhl.title.35115"", ""10.1080/00033798500200421"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198854036.001.0001"", ""10.7312/hell93228""]","['Immunology and Microbiology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Archeology', 'Philosophy', 'Microbiology']","[[('1001 基础医学', 0.7323), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.732), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7292), ('0710 生物学', 0.7287), ('0836 生物工程', 0.72)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7577), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7421)]]"

It claims that Jonas saw Heideggerian existentialism not as a modern instantiation of Gnosticism but as a specific experiential reaction to the new cosmological outlook that emerged from the seventeenth-century scientific revolution, which negated the conceptual world that made Gnosticism possible. Jonas's interpretation is “against the grain”: by claiming that Heidegger's thought is a product of the reduction of nature to measurable, manipulable, and calculable extension governing the modern scientific mind, Jonas attributed to Heidegger the very flaws Heidegger critiqued in others. It is further claimed that Jonas's original contribution to Heidegger's reception history is not in proposing the link to Gnosticism but in reading him as the philosophical outcome of the instrumental reasoning of modern science.","[{""name"": ""Daniel M.

Drawing on archival material, it argues that Rawls's fascination with tradition arose out of his own pedagogical engagement with the debate around the “death of political philosophy” in the 1950s. Throughout, I highlight the significance of Rawls's teaching—beginning with his earliest lectures on social and political philosophy at Cornell, to his shifting views on “the tradition” in his published works, culminating in the increasingly contextually minded and irenic approach on display inPolitical Liberalism(1993) andJustice as Fairness. This neglected aspect of the “historical Rawls” offers insight into how Rawls himself might have read “John Rawls” as a figure in the history of political thought—and reveals that he spent a lot more time contemplating that question than one might think.","[{""name"": ""Teresa M.

It discusses the trajectory of the Malayan Left during this period, with a special focus on the work of Abdullah C. D., a Malay Muslim leader of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). Abdullah's work included helping to build the Malay Nationalist Party of Malaya (PKMM) under the MCP's United Front strategy from 1945, creating the MCP's Department of Malay Work in 1946, and establishing the Tenth Regiment of the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA) in 1949. This work was essential to the MCP's outreach to Malay Muslims after Malaya's failed national revolution, which collapsed into racial conflict without achieving independence for the British colony. The Malayan Emergency was declared in 1948, and its military and social campaigns eliminated or displaced the MCP's leadership and much of the MNLA, including Abdullah and the rest of the Tenth Regiment, to Thailand by 1954. Despite his continued engagement with political movements in Malaya, Abdullah's vision for a new politics for Malay Muslims was effectively displaced into the realm of nostalgia. His ideas, outlined in MNLA pamphlets and periodicals like Tauladan (Exemplar), never made significant inroads in Malaya, whose racial state the Emergency re-established, using race to manage the threat to its interests posed by leftist politics.","[{""name"": ""Amrita Malhi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/179325410X526113"", ""10.1017/S0165115321000243"", ""10.1017/S0165115321000255"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1xz0b7"", ""10.5040/9781350118560"", ""10.7591/9781501719318"", ""10.7312/trav17942"", ""10.1525/9780520964921"", ""10.1017/S0165115321000267"", ""10.1017/S0165115321000231"", ""10.1355/9789812305145"", ""10.1080/09592318.2012.709764"", ""10.1111/hic3.12523"", ""10.1080/00472336.2019.1709128"", ""10.4324/9780203116616"", ""10.1355/9789814517928"", ""10.1017/S0165115321000292"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1nthp3"", ""10.1080/14649373.2015.1008201"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16695-3"", ""10.1163/9789004260467"", ""10.1353/jod.2014.0020"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1ntgx1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/ihs.2021.54,IRISH HISTORICAL STUDIES,0603 World History,Queer Belfast during the First World War: masculinity and same-sex desire in the Irish city,"AbstractQueer history is still in its infancy in Ireland, with political approaches and the more recent past, and the gay rights movement particularly, providing the primary focus so far. This article takes a different approach by investigating the everyday experiences, identities and policing of men who had sex with men in the early twentieth century. Using two extraordinary case studies from Belfast during the First World War, I explore different lives ― from youth to adulthood, sexual encounter to arrest, and trial to life afterwards. I argue that queer culture in Belfast shared aspects with other western metropolises, particularly in terms of urban cruising, payment for sex and relationships structured by class. Public responses too, from newspaper to courtroom, were articulated through transnational formulations of respectability and masculinity. At the same time, however, Belfast's queer men were shaped by their movement within a peculiarly Irish network of places, both in and beyond the country's borders. Religious and political structures specific to Ulster also affected how such men fared in the legal system and in their lives following their trials. By detailing both the similarities yet divergences of queer experience in Belfast, I thus aim to raise a new agenda for studying male sexuality in the north of Ireland.","[{""name"": ""Tom Hulme"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7560/JHS28303"", ""10.1057/9780230290693"", ""10.7591/9781501728693"", ""10.1086/341152""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It reduces the resource requirements for computational power and storage space by quantizing the weights and/or activation tensors of a DNN into lower bit-width fixed-point numbers, resulting in quantized neural networks (QNNs). While it has been empirically shown to introduce minor accuracy loss, critical verified properties of a DNN might become invalid once quantized. Existing verification methods focus on either individual neural networks (DNNs or QNNs) or quantization error bound for partial quantization. In this work, we propose a quantization error bound verification method, named , where both weights and activation tensors are quantized. consists of two parts, i.e., a differential reachability analysis (DRA) and a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) based verification method. DRA performs difference analysis between the DNN and its quantized counterpart layer-by-layer to compute a tight quantization error interval efficiently. If DRA fails to prove the error bound, then we encode the verification problem into an equivalent MILP problem which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Thus, is sound, complete, and reasonably efficient. We implement and conduct extensive experiments, showing its effectiveness and efficiency.","[{""name"": ""Yedi Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fu Song"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jun Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_11"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314614"", ""10.1145/3319535.3354245"", ""10.1109/TDSC.2021.3088661"", ""10.1109/SP.2017.49"", ""10.1109/SP40001.2021.00004"", ""10.1109/TDSC.2022.3189397"", ""10.1109/TDSC.2022.3220673"", ""10.1145/512950.512973"", ""10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207596"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_3"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00175"", ""10.1109/SP.2018.00058"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_5"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2019.00495"", ""10.1109/ISSRE52982.2021.00044"", ""10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16496"", ""10.1109/MSP.2012.2205597"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00286"", ""10.2514/1.G003724"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00448"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2014.223"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-32304-2_15"", ""10.1145/3368089.3417918"", ""10.1007/s11390-020-0546-7"", ""10.1109/TCAD.2022.3197697"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-85037-1_8"", ""10.1137/1.9780898717716"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2005.05.003"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.12206"", ""10.1145/3377811.3380337"", ""10.1145/3324884.3416560"", ""10.1145/3132747.3132785"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-24258-9_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-24258-9_25"", ""10.1145/3290354"", ""10.1002/int.22510"", ""10.1145/3180155.3180220"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30942-8_39"", ""10.26226/morressier.604907f41a80aac83ca25cfb"", ""10.1109/TSE.2019.2962027"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-37703-7_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_8"", ""10.1145/3563212"", ""10.1145/3551349.3556916"", ""10.1145/3460319.3464822"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-22308-2_20""]","['Computer Science', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

They referred to this as pragmatics, and argued that a key enabler would be the ability to automatically synthesize customized graphical views from a (possibly textual) model. The model would be the “ground truth” used, for example, for downstream code synthesis and simulation; the graphical views would typically be abstractions from the model serving various purposes, including documentation.Twelve years later, we reflect on their proposal, and illustrate the current state with the recently developed polyglot coordination language Lingua Franca (LF). LF has been designed with pragmatics in mind since early on, and some characteristics of LF make it particularly suited for pragmatics-aware programming and modeling. However, the underlying pragmatic principles are broadly applicable, and by now a set of mature open source tools is available for putting them into practice.","[{""name"": ""Reinhard von Hanxleden"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Edward A.

The historical pandemics covered here offer an entry point to a fruitful set of genealogies, chronologies, epidemiologies, trajectories, and imaginaries linked to a host of issues: what makes a pandemic ‘global’? What does a global history perspective bring to the table? How does examining germs and genomes shed light on imperialism as a/the pandemic driver?

Car culture and the car's attractions are not denied. American society, however, is a complex of numerous subcultures, including many that resented and resisted the automobile's growing priority during the twentieth century. Such groups’ resistance to automobile domination has been neglected. Persistent advocacy for pedestrians’ interests is illustrated through numerous examples from the 1920s to the 1960s, the decades when ‘car culture’ rose to its apogee.","[{""name"": ""Peter Norton"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/mhr.2010.0011"", ""10.5204/jps.v2i2.94"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262141000.001.0001"", ""10.1353/tech.2007.0085""]","['Environmental Science', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['History', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Marketing']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

In education, in particular, LLMs hold enormous potential for enabling personalized learning and equal opportunities for all students. In a traditional classroom environment, students often struggle to develop individual writing skills because the workload of the teachers limits their ability to provide detailed feedback on each student’s essay. To bridge this gap, we have developed a tool called PEER (Paper Evaluation and Empowerment Resource) which exploits the power of LLMs and provides students with comprehensive and engaging feedback on their essays. Our goal is to motivate each student to enhance their writing skills through positive feedback and specific suggestions for improvement. Since its launch in February 2023, PEER has received high levels of interest and demand, resulting in more than 4000 essays uploaded to the platform to date. Moreover, there has been an overwhelming response from teachers who are interested in the project since it has the potential to alleviate their workload by making the task of grading essays less tedious. By collecting a real-world data set incorporating essays of students and feedback from teachers, we will be able to refine and enhance PEER through model fine-tuning in the next steps. Our goal is to leverage LLMs to enhance personalized learning, reduce teacher workload, and ensure that every student has an equal opportunity to excel in writing.

During the era of ‘legitimate commerce’, West African merchants required liquidity to conduct long-distance trade. Rather than demand human pawns as interest on loans, merchants imprisoned debtors’ female relatives because women's sexual violation in prison incentivized kin to repay loans. When British colonists entered the Gold Coast, they discovered how important the prisons were to local credit. They thus allowed the institutions to continue, but without documentation. The so-called ‘native prisons’ did not enter indirect rule — and the colonial archive — until the 1940s. Contrary to studies of how Western states used prisons to control black labour after emancipation, this article excavates a ‘debt genealogy’ of the prison. In the Gold Coast, prisons helped manage cash flow after abolition by holding human hostages.","[{""name"": ""SARAH BALAKRISHNAN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-1-349-27927-2"", ""10.1080/01440399808575244"", ""10.1017/S0021853714000073"", ""10.2307/j.ctvh1dkm2"", ""10.2307/3601114"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198201526.003.0007"", ""10.1080/01924036.1991.9688965"", ""10.1215/9780822386148"", ""10.1017/S0021855300002254"", ""10.1017/S0021853700033016"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16018-1"", ""10.1515/9781580466363"", ""10.2307/j.ctv260719g.6"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139644594.010"", ""10.1017/S0021853700022052"", ""10.2307/1159747"", ""10.1086/494732"", ""10.5309/willmaryquar.70.2.0317"", ""10.1017/S0021853700007787"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-22916-1_5"", ""10.1163/157006709X458882"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199651702.001.0001"", ""10.2307/219449""]",['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

A bug is robustly reachable if acontrolled inputcan make it so the bug is reached whatever the value ofuncontrolled input. Robust reachability is better suited than standard reachability in many realistic situations related to security (e.g., criticality assessment or bug prioritization) or software engineering (e.g., replicable test suites and flakiness). We propose a formal treatment of the concept, and we revisit existing symbolic bug finding methods through this new lens. Remarkably, robust reachability allows differentiating bounded model checking from symbolic execution while they have the same deductive power in the standard case. Finally, we propose the first symbolic verifier dedicated to robust reachability: we use it for criticality assessment of 4 existing vulnerabilities, and compare it with standard symbolic execution.","[{""name"": ""Guillaume Girol"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benjamin Farinier"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sébastien Bardin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/2560217.2560219"", ""10.1007/3-540-61474-5_75"", ""10.1145/3182657"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_14"", ""10.1007/11609773_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-18275-4_8"", ""10.1145/2408776.2408795"", ""10.1109/SP.2012.31"", ""10.1609/aaai.v30i1.10416"", ""10.1007/3-540-48683-6_44"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24730-2_15"", ""10.1007/BFb0025774"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_15"", ""10.3233/JCS-2009-0393"", ""10.1007/11817963_37"", ""10.1109/SP40000.2020.00074"", ""10.1109/SANER.2016.43"", ""10.1145/2931037.2931048"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96142-2_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02658-4_25"", ""10.1145/1993498.1993529"", ""10.1145/1065010.1065036"", ""10.1145/2090147.2094081"", ""10.1109/SP.1982.10014"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-04694-0_6"", ""10.1007/BF01211866"", ""10.1145/2166.357214"", ""10.1145/1920261.1920300"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73595-3_13"", ""10.3233/SAT190101"", ""10.1145/3371078"", ""10.1109/ASE.2019.00060"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_42"", ""10.21236/ADA482657"", ""10.1109/SP.2016.17"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2014.07.001"", ""10.1007/11408901_21""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

First, it discusses scholarship advocating a new understanding of the concept of “economic nationalism” beyond its traditional focus on protectionist state policies. Second, the article branches out to consider a more interdisciplinary body of literature addressing the nationalism-economy nexus, and it relates this literature to broader debates in nationalism studies, distinguishing between three prominent approaches in the discipline: nationalism as political movement and ideology; nationalism as political discourse; and everyday nationalism. The article concludes with suggestions for future research.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Fetzer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00396338.2018.1495442"", ""10.1080/13501763.2011.638131"", ""10.1080/09692290.2010.507132"", ""10.1177/1469540517690570"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7_8"", ""10.1080/00905992.2010.515970"", ""10.4324/9780203861394"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199752164.001.0001"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00164"", ""10.1177/1468796808088925"", ""10.1177/03058298980270011001"", ""10.1111/aepr.12226"", ""10.1080/096922997347887"", ""10.1080/13691830120090421"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199546848.001.0001"", ""10.2307/3096134"", ""10.1080/00905992.2010.549473"", ""10.1163/9789004234307"", ""10.1080/13563460600655581"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558764"", ""10.1080/09692290.2014.919336"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2010.00472.x"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-52313-6"", ""10.1111/nana.12121"", ""10.1017/S0010417598001674"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2009.00411.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1tg5k14"", ""10.1257/jel.37.2.571"", ""10.1111/1468-2478.00235"", ""10.1080/714000928"", ""10.1111/nana.12520"", ""10.1111/1469-8219.00102"", ""10.4135/9781848608061"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719080975.001.0001"", ""10.4271/0674050916"", ""10.1080/095023898335627"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13510347.2017.1307825"", ""10.1016/j.finmar.2010.10.006"", ""10.14361/transcript.9783839419540"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00514.x"", ""10.1080/14608944.2015.1113242"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2007.00280.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199585977.013.0023"", ""10.4324/9781315739342-28"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490958"", ""10.1111/1469-8219.00077"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199209194.001.0001"", ""10.1023/A:1006871114987"", ""10.1177/0002764298041010004"", ""10.1080/13501763.2011.640788"", ""10.1163/25888072-02011022"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199646210.001.0001"", ""10.1163/9789401203494"", ""10.21825/snm.85398""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Human capital plays an important role in economic growth and welfare. It is also one of the dimensions of inequality. Our results are at odds with many of the usual assumptions on which most Mexicanist historiography is based. Age heaping levels of males and females and ethnic groups across locations in Central New Spain are estimated and compared through ad hoc indicators with other countries. We infer that a more empirical emphasis on the institutional legacy of the viceregal period and more attention to human capital since pre-Conquest times will benefit the progress of Hispanic American economic history.,"[{""name"": ""Andrés Calderón-Fernández"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rafael Dobado-González"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alfredo García-Hiernaux"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ehb.2011.02.002"", ""10.1016/0165-1889(80)90069-X"", ""10.1353/eco.2002.0013"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2012.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2011.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.ehb.2016.12.003"", ""10.1017/S021261091000008X"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2009.05.004"", ""10.1017/S0212610910000108"", ""10.1017/S0212610914000135"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00582.x"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2009.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.japwor.2017.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2017.10.005"", ""10.1017/S0022216X14000054"", ""10.3386/w15305"", ""10.3386/w11057"", ""10.1257/aer.91.5.1369"", ""10.1162/003355302320935025"", ""10.1016/j.ehb.2018.03.004"", ""10.1017/S0022050709001120"", ""10.1162/JINH_a_00049"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511551024"", ""10.1017/S0022050716000954"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.12064"", ""10.1111/ehr.12615"", ""10.1353/lar.2005.0040"", ""10.1017/S0022216X08004689"", ""10.1111/ehr.12382"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00605.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00499.x"", ""10.1017/S0212610915000051"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00483.x"", ""10.1023/B:JOEG.0000038933.16398.ed"", ""10.1080/03585522.2012.727763"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521245166.010"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02403.x"", ""10.1017/S021261091700012X""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Demography', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X19000402,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,NEGOTIATING FEMALE PROPERTY- AND SLAVE-OWNERSHIP IN THE ARISTOCRATIC WORLD,"AbstractThis article uses Anna Eliza Grenville, first duchess of Buckingham and Chandos, as a lens through which to explore the gendering of aristocratic property- and slave-ownership in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Britain. Alongside the extensive metropolitan property that Grenville brought to her marriage was Hope estate, a Jamaican plantation upon which worked 379 enslaved men, women, and children. Using legal records, family papers, and correspondence, the article examines the ways in which Grenville negotiated her position as a married woman and substantial property-owner, and considers what it meant for a married woman to ‘own’ property, landed and in the form of other human beings, in the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century aristocratic world. Examining her absentee slave-ownership alongside her metropolitan property-ownership highlights the complex intersections between race, class, and gender across both metropole and colony. In doing so, the article makes an important contribution to the rapidly expanding scholarship exploring female property-ownership in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain, hitherto almost entirely metropolitan in focus. It demonstrates how seamlessly enslaved property could be integrated into aristocratic forms of property-ownership and transmission, and highlights the important role that women played in bringing slave-ownership ‘home’ to metropolitan Britain.","[{""name"": ""HANNAH YOUNG"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09612020601022261"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139024044"", ""10.1017/S0268416002004253"", ""10.1080/09612029800200187"", ""10.1353/pgn.2002.0016"", ""10.1515/9781400858293"", ""10.1515/9780773590137"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139626958"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_1005034"", ""10.4324/9781315867427"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1ww3txs"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-30880-7"", ""10.1111/gend.12002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199299713.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2597370"", ""10.1017/S008044011500002X"", ""10.1111/1468-0424.12014"", ""10.1353/pgn.2002.0086"", ""10.4324/9780203822029"", ""10.1111/1468-0424.12085"", ""10.2307/2738280"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495670"", ""10.2307/2596344"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674436206"", ""10.1215/9780822386148"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-25704-1"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198207276.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199593767.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198203988.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

During the early reform period Yugoslav intellectuals reorganized socialist ideology around new understandings of autonomy and creativity in ways that resonated with liberal traditions and diverged sharply from the Soviet paradigm. These concepts informed Yugoslav ideas of social self-management and national self-determination and facilitated the country's orientation to the postcolonial world. They also underpinned the new realm of cultural production, where reformers such as Miroslav Krleža and Marko Ristić mobilized this new concern with autonomous creativity to revive previously discarded aesthetic theories of interwar modernism.","[{""name"": ""JAMES M.

For instance, information displayed in trains, as well as on departure boards in train stations and on platforms, are often not available in acoustic or tactile form. Digital technologies, such as smartphones or smartwatches, can provide an alternative means of access. However, these alternatives do not guarantee that the user experience is comparable in value, quality and efficiency. The present case study details a participatory design process, where travellers with visual impairments co-designed a mobile app. The goal was to tackle information gaps on journeys by public transport and to learn how participatory design can facilitate the provision of comparable experiences for users with disabilities. Travellers with visual impairments were involved in a collaborative process in all project phases, including problem identification, technical feasibility, proof of concept, design and development. Participatory design contributed to a thorough understanding of the user perspective and allowed the app to be optimised for the needs of travellers with visual impairments. Furthermore, co-design proved to be an effective method for fostering awareness and knowledge about digital accessibility at all organisational levels.","[{""name"": ""Beat Vollenwyder"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Esther Buchmüller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian Trachsel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Klaus Opwis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Florian Brühlmann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2016.03.008"", ""10.1080/15295036.2014.919660"", ""10.1145/3328020.3353957"", ""10.1145/1240624.1240688"", ""10.1145/2745555.2746653"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-73356-2_10"", ""10.1145/2207676.2207736"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.11.016"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58796-3_35"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2013.848238""]","['Social Sciences', 'Health Professions', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Occupational Therapy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1011 护理学', 0.6926), ('1009 特种医学', 0.6806)]]"

We consider this for Markov automata, a compositional model that captures both traditional Markov decision processes (MDPs) as well as a continuous-time variant thereof. The crux of our procedure is a generalization of Forejt et al.’s approach for total rewards on MDPs to arbitrary combinations of long-run and total reward objectives on Markov automata. Experiments with a prototypical implementation on top of the Storm model checker show encouraging results for both model types and indicate a substantial improved performance over existing multi-objective long-run MDP model checking based on linear programming.","[{""name"": ""Tim Quatmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joost-Pieter Katoen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_10"", ""10.1145/3373718.3394761"", ""10.1145/3209108.3209184"", ""10.1145/2603088.2603089"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54804-8_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_27"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91908-9_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_22"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2017.09.010"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_16"", ""10.2168/LMCS-10(1:13)2014"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_12"", ""10.1016/j.jcss.2016.09.009"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17465-1_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24953-7_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-77050-3_39"", ""10.1145/2933575.2934513"", ""10.23638/LMCS-13(2:15)2017"", ""10.1007/11672142_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_19"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2012.10.010"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38697-8_6"", ""10.1109/LICS.2010.41"", ""10.2168/LMCS-4(4:8)2008"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-19835-9_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-33386-6_25"", ""10.2168/LMCS-10(3:17)2014"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11936-6_13"", ""10.1109/TAC.2018.2799561"", ""10.1145/3309683"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_19"", ""10.1007/s10817-020-09574-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17462-0_20"", ""10.14279/tuj.eceasst.53.783"", ""10.1109/RELDI.2000.885410"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0456-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_25"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0476-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_47"", ""10.1002/9780470316887"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_37"", ""10.5281/zenodo.4094999"", ""10.1007/s10703-016-0262-7"", ""10.1287/ijoc.1100.0419"", ""10.1016/0377-2217(93)90192-P""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

This article investigates the labor heroes of the Yan'an period as the pivot in the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) attempt at reconceptualizing society, establishing new social relations and creating a socialist subjectivity. It reveals the new symbolic order constructed in the official media, primarilyJiefang Ribao(Liberation Daily), and highlights the relation between labor heroes (as representatives of the “masses”), intellectuals, and Mao Zedong in the construction of new hierarchies. In particular, it shows how the CCP chose work as the fundament of socialist society and the core of a new concept of “collective heroism”; how the stage of the first labor hero assembly was used to orchestrate Mao Zedong as a charismatic leader; and how labor heroes and writers, through direct encounter, redefined their respective place in society.","[{""name"": ""Nicola Spakowski"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctvbtzp48"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674188839.c4"", ""10.1017/S0305741000003763"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-17423-2"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511984754"", ""10.1525/9780520972827"", ""10.1515/9781503634923"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198295235.001.0001"", ""10.1515/transcript.9783839419922.69"", ""10.1177/009770048300900204"", ""10.1086/tcj.59.20066378"", ""10.1007/BF03204051"", ""10.1177/0097700418767609"", ""10.30965/9783846754849_004"", ""10.1524/9783050048550.129""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

In this study, we examine electricity adoption in Sweden during the first decades of the twentieth century. Exploiting that proximity to hydropowered plants shaped the electricity network independently of previous local conditions, we estimate the impact of electricity on labor strikes. Our results indicate that electricity adoption preceded an increase in conflicts, but strikes were of an offensive nature and most common in sectors with increasing labor demand. This suggests that electrification provided workers with a stronger bargaining position from which they could voice their claims.","[{""name"": ""Jakob Molinder"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tobias Karlsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kerstin Enflo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780203123331"", ""10.1017/S0022050715001540"", ""10.1162/rest.89.1.118"", ""10.1017/S0022050700010767"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2019.102412"", ""10.1017/S0022050719000743"", ""10.18128/D020.V7.2"", ""10.1007/s11698-013-0102-6"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2011.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019"", ""10.1093/ereh/hey023"", ""10.1093/0195142977.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03585522.2012.727764"", ""10.1257/000282806777212620"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt034"", ""10.2307/2095284"", ""10.1257/jep.29.3.31"", ""10.3386/w18752"", ""10.1162/003355398555720"", ""10.1086/298367"", ""10.1080/00236569512331385533"", ""10.3386/w26477"", ""10.1177/002218569003200103"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2013.04.002"", ""10.1080/0023656X.2013.804271"", ""10.1017/S0022050700029673"", ""10.1006/exeh.2002.0787"", ""10.1177/001979398904200302""]",['Social Sciences'],['Public Administration'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

This paper returns to the sites of extraction, studying imperial maps made from 1889–1925 to delineate oyster reefs on the seafloor. Building from the submarine up, I draw on environmental, animal, and history of science studies to explore the work of mapping oceanic, animate space. Attending to the role of divers, whose labor was required to make the seafloor visible, and the lifecycles of oysters, which changed over time, I argue that the seafloor represents a kind ofunruly terrain, out of both the reach and control of imperial authorities. The paper’s final section meditates on reading humans as part of Indian Ocean landscapes and the possibilities this offers for further comparative, transnational work in a materialist vein.","[{""name"": ""Tamara Fernando"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv224tw78.10"", ""10.1093/ahr/118.2.349"", ""10.1080/00253359.1945.10658929"", ""10.1080/14649360802224358"", ""10.1525/california/9780520244535.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv224tw78"", ""10.1177/2043820617691635"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-42595-1"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469638973.001.0001"", ""10.3138/E635-7827-1757-9T53"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-95771-1"", ""10.2307/j.ctv224tw78.11"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1360.2010.01070.x"", ""10.1017/S174002282000011X"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01311.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wpmb1"", ""10.1177/0309132519863483"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226041285.001.0001"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300192018.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14650045.2018.1465041"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511497193"", ""10.1086/368119"", ""10.2307/j.ctv12101zq"", ""10.9783/9780812294781"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226626895.001.0001"", ""10.1068/d24010"", ""10.1177/20438206211001035"", ""10.1177/0309132518817829"", ""10.1068/d71j"", ""10.1068/d14148p"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtab002"", ""10.1068/d130655""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Geography, Planning and Development', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/S001041752100030X,COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN SOCIETY AND HISTORY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,Making Reliable Persons: Managing Descent and Genealogical Computation in Pakistan,"AbstractIn 2016, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), which produces Pakistan’s biometric-based national identity card, publicly announced that it would be “re-verifying” identity cards for a national security drive. NADRA relies on the documentation of descent-based relations, including genealogical charts (shajarah-yi-nasab), for its verification procedures. In so doing, NADRA asks the difficult question of who belongs where and who is a citizen, based on who they used to be. This article historically traces the movement of genealogies between the realm of the familial and the bureaucratic. I examine how the colonial state deployed genealogical expertise and how this formation folds into the postcolonial present in ways that shape capacities for genealogy-based claims to identity. It demonstrates how what I term “genealogical computation” extends beyond the domain of governance into articulations of identity that seek to establish status, reliability, and trustworthiness. I argue that “reliable persons” are produced in contemporary Pakistan through an encounter between the genealogical computations of citizens and the expectations of an ethno-securitized state. This encounter is borne out of a rehearsed relation where one’s genealogy, which has held a particular meaning in relation to one kind of security state (the colonial), is now asked to take on another.","[{""name"": ""Zehra Hashmi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1525/can.1988.3.1.02a00050"", ""10.1177/006996677200600101"", ""10.1525/can.2007.22.1.129"", ""10.1080/00856401.2019.1594065"", ""10.1525/9780520939530-010"", ""10.1525/ae.1986.13.2.02a00070"", ""10.2307/3034632"", ""10.1017/S0018246X14000296"", ""10.1080/13621025.2013.793070"", ""10.18574/nyu/9780814732090.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822383222-006"", ""10.1163/15685209-12341519"", ""10.1177/14634990122228728"", ""10.1525/9780520916388"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226925134.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-102313-030329"", ""10.1080/00856401.2019.1593597"", ""10.3998/mpub.7203"", ""10.1017/S0026749X19000015"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790799"", ""10.1177/006996685019001010"", ""10.1017/S0003975600004367"", ""10.4159/9780674246164"", ""10.1215/18752160-7218326"", ""10.14318/hau5.1.023"", ""10.1177/025764309200800103"", ""10.4159/9780674033740"", ""10.1525/california/9780520244535.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1425.2010.01288.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Using prices from more than 200 South Asian markets spanning 1861 to 1921, we show that linguistic distance correlates negatively with market integration. A one-standard-deviation increase in linguistic distance predicts a reduction in the price correlation between two markets of 0.121 standard deviations for wheat, 0.181 for salt, and 0.088 for rice. While factors like genetic distance, literacy gaps, and railway connections are correlated with linguistic distance, they do not fully explain the correlation between linguistic distance and market integration.","[{""name"": ""James Fenske"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Namrata Kala"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511486876"", ""10.1257/aer.103.3.528"", ""10.1257/aer.101.7.3221"", ""10.1017/S0022050700096297"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000265"", ""10.2307/410649"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2014.03.027"", ""10.1257/aer.20150243"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2012.05.007"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2012.02.018"", ""10.1257/aer.102.4.1508"", ""10.1162/qjec.2009.124.3.1095"", ""10.1257/aer.103.5.1629"", ""10.1257/aer.20101199"", ""10.1017/S002205071900007X"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521228022.008"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2012.02.001"", ""10.1093/jeg/lbt019"", ""10.1017/S0022050717000481"", ""10.1017/S0022050708000351"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican1089-106"", ""10.1534/g3.113.005728"", ""10.1162/003465302317331955"", ""10.1257/aer.20140297"", ""10.1257/aer.97.4.1189"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt005"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2009.07.012"", ""10.1111/geer.12047"", ""10.1017/S1361491602000023"", ""10.1353/jhr.2012.0016"", ""10.1111/ecoj.12037"", ""10.1257/0022051042177649"", ""10.1111/ehr.12078"", ""10.5281/zenodo.3835942"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496820"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2011.02.003"", ""10.1257/aer.102.4.1310"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2019.102384"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521228022.017"", ""10.1257/aer.20140832"", ""10.1017/S0022050700079845"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00161"", ""10.1017/S0022050714000059"", ""10.1038/nature14317"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4968.003.0003"", ""10.1257/aer.20130604"", ""10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00084-0"", ""10.2307/20062091"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521228022.009"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521228022.007"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican0390-110"", ""10.1017/S1361491610000146"", ""10.1002/jae.2633"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00009197"", ""10.1162/003355303321675419"", ""10.1086/426036"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521228022.019"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521228022.010"", ""10.1017/S0022050710000318"", ""10.1257/aer.101.5.2003"", ""10.1198/jbes.2010.07136"", ""10.1006/exeh.1999.0718"", ""10.4269/ajtmh.2004.70.486"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2014.04.004"", ""10.1046/j.1466-822x.2002.00294.x"", ""10.1007/s10887-018-9154-6"", ""10.1162/qjec.2009.124.2.469"", ""10.1017/S0007680513001402"", ""10.1257/aer.98.2.529"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511920516"", ""10.1017/S0022050709000400"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511619069.004"", ""10.1016/0014-4983(75)90004-2"", ""10.1257/aer.100.2.449"", ""10.3982/ECTA10984"", ""10.1057/9780230594869""]",['Social Sciences'],['Demography'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)]]"

Although all four pursue a set of identity politics that would legitimize the separatist cause, comparing them reveals important differences in boundary-making strategies. While maintaining the image of the enemy parent-state and of an imminent external threat is a common endeavor, they face different challenges and thus have pursued different strategies of identity-building. Transnistria and Abkhazia are two ethnically heterogeneous entities while Nagorno-Karabakh and South Ossetia are more homogeneous since (forced) displacements, mostly of non-titular ethnicities, took place. The Abkhazs, Ossetians, and Armenians claim titular status in their respective regions, but only the latter two have kin in neighboring countries with whom they want to unify. Meanwhile, the “Transnistrian people” is a newly invented construct. Despite their lack of international recognition, the article demonstrates that – apart from a special emphasis on cultivating the image of the “enemy parent-state” – the nation-building mechanisms in the de facto states do not substantially differ from the processes at work in other post-Soviet states presented in this Special Issue.","[{""name"": ""Magdalena Dembińska"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/nps.2018.26"", ""10.1080/00905999808408554"", ""10.1353/wp.2001.0017"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2012.03.008"", ""10.2753/PPC1075-8216600302"", ""10.2747/1060-586X.27.2.178"", ""10.4324/9780429448409"", ""10.2747/1060-586X.27.1.1"", ""10.1080/10758216.2017.1388182"", ""10.18778/2300-0562.06.13"", ""10.1111/isqu.12110"", ""10.1080/09668130801948158"", ""10.2747/1539-7216.49.6.670"", ""10.1111/nana.12386"", ""10.1080/14683857.2016.1148411"", ""10.1017/nps.2019.69"", ""10.1080/00905990801934371"", ""10.1080/01419870.2012.675079"", ""10.1080/00905992.2016.1157158"", ""10.1017/S0003975602001066"", ""10.1080/15387216.2019.1645032"", ""10.1080/15387216.2018.1468793"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558764"", ""10.1080/23761199.2021.1932068"", ""10.1080/17449057.2013.864805"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598876"", ""10.1080/00396330802329014"", ""10.1080/0090599042000230287"", ""10.1353/kri.2003.0027"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2005.09.003"", ""10.1080/21622671.2013.842184"", ""10.1080/714004708"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199927371.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00905990701475061"", ""10.1007/s12116-008-9030-z"", ""10.1080/00905992.2015.1082996"", ""10.1177/0888325413484174"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198295341.001.0001"", ""10.1080/19448953.2014.986378"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2012.03.004"", ""10.1007/s11300-012-0216-8"", ""10.1023/A:1007068714468"", ""10.1080/10758216.2020.1785317"", ""10.1080/14683857.2012.686013"", ""10.1080/15387216.2015.1012644"", ""10.4324/9780203834510"", ""10.1080/00905992.2011.599376"", ""10.1007/s10308-018-0522-9"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00527.x"", ""10.1080/02757206.2012.759326"", ""10.1080/00905992.2016.1203300"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2013.780417"", ""10.1080/01419870050033667"", ""10.1515/9782760644748"", ""10.7591/9781501702006""]","['Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

At runtime, there are often certain actions (a.k.a. treatments) that workers may execute to lift the probability that a case ends in a positive outcome. For example, in a loan origination process, a possible treatment is to issue multiple loan offers to increase the probability that the customer takes a loan. Each treatment has a cost. Thus, when defining policies for prescribing treatments to cases, managers need to consider the net gain of the treatments. Also, the effect of a treatment varies over time: treating a case earlier may be more effective than later in a case. This paper presents a prescriptive monitoring method that automates this decision-making task. The method combines causal inference and reinforcement learning to learn treatment policies that maximize the net gain. The method leverages a conformal prediction technique to speed up the convergence of the reinforcement learning mechanism by separating cases that are likely to end up in a positive or negative outcome, from uncertain cases. An evaluation on two real-life datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline.","[{""name"": ""Zahra Dasht Bozorgi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marlon Dumas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marcello La Rosa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Artem Polyvyanyy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mahmoud Shoush"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Irene Teinemaa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1073/pnas.1510489113"", ""10.1109/ICPM49681.2020.00028"", ""10.1109/ICPM53251.2021.9576853"", ""10.1007/s10115-021-01633-w"", ""10.1109/ICPM57379.2022.9980719"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58666-9_10"", ""10.7717/peerj-cs.1097"", ""10.1109/ICPM49681.2020.00013"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58666-9_16"", ""10.1109/ICPM57379.2022.9980535"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-66498-5_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-79108-7_7"", ""10.1037/h0037350"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-16171-1_13"", ""10.1145/3301300"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98651-7_6"", ""10.1145/3331449"", ""10.1080/01621459.2017.1319839"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58638-6_12""]","['Mathematics', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management Information Systems', 'Statistics and Probability']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"

It comes in the form of akernel function, well known in machine learning as a conceptually and computationally efficient tool. The correspondingkernel trickallows us to circumvent the complicated process of feature extraction, i.e. the (typically manual) effort to identify the decisive properties of formulae so that learning can be applied. We demonstrate this consequence and its advantages on the task ofpredicting (quantitative) satisfactionof STL formulae on stochastic processes: Using our kernel and the kernel trick, we learn (i) computationally efficiently (ii) a practically precise predictor of satisfaction, (iii) avoiding the difficult task of finding a way to explicitly turn formulae into vectors of numbers in a sensible way. We back the high precision we have achieved in the experiments by a theoretically sound PAC guarantee, ensuring our procedure efficiently delivers a close-to-optimal predictor.","[{""name"": ""Luca Bortolussi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Giuseppe Maria Gallo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Křetínský"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Nenzi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.tcs.2015.02.046"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10512-3_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-75632-5_5"", ""10.1145/2883817.2883843"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-70914-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8"", ""10.1109/34.1000236"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.CONCUR.2016.20"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_19"", ""10.29007/trr1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-32079-9_3"", ""10.1109/CDC40024.2019.9029429"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31784-3_24"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0079345"", ""10.1109/CDC.2018.8619541"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-30206-3_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99154-2_20"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198502456.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3206.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511809682"", ""10.1007/3-540-45657-0_17""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)]]"

In this article we focus on the role of the Kew Museum of Economic Botany in supplying schools with botanical specimens and artefacts for their own museums during this period, to support a broad variety of curricular agendas, from nature study to geography and beyond. The evidence suggests that this scheme was remarkably popular, with demand among teachers for museum objects outstripping supply, and increasingly being met in other ways. Seen from the perspective of Kew, the distribution of specimens, artefacts, and visual materials to schools was a way of extending the ethos of economic botany into the classroom. For the teachers who requested specimens in large numbers, and the pupils who studied and handled them, however, such objects may have had other meanings and uses. More broadly, we propose new avenues for study that can help us to better appreciate the ways in which museum objects, expertise, and practices moved across professional, institutional, and increasingly global boundaries in this period.","[{""name"": ""LAURA NEWMAN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""FELIX DRIVER"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0007087498003240"", ""10.1017/S0007087418000511"", ""10.1080/0046760810100104"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1379.2010.01072.x"", ""10.1353/con.1998.0020"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190225032.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226481173.001.0001"", ""10.1177/007327531405200103"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226476742.001.0001"", ""10.1179/1936981614Z.00000000042"", ""10.1177/147447409400100203"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199287802.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0010417503000057"", ""10.1016/j.jhg.2006.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.endeavour.2008.01.003"", ""10.2979/vic.2010.52.3.353"", ""10.4324/9781315574523"", ""10.1080/0046760X.2016.1273402"", ""10.15730/books.12"", ""10.1016/j.jhg.2005.08.002"", ""10.2307/622711"", ""10.3366/anh.2012.0062"", ""10.1111/muan.12059"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226449920.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09647770600202102""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Social Psychology', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

The article further examines the revisions to Schmitt's 1967 version of the text in the light of Karl Löwith's criticisms of Schmitt in an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung from 1964. The article argues that The Tyranny of Values is a work of post-Second World War Nazi apologetics, in which Nazi racial theory can be seen being put to polemical ends in the 1960s and 1970s. The article concludes with broader reflections on the relation of Schmitt's The Tyranny of Values to Nazi discourse in the aftermath of the Second World War and the history of Nazism post-1945.","[{""name"": ""Samuel Garrett Zeitlin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0018246X19000323"", ""10.1353/hum.2018.0011"", ""10.1515/9781501730665"", ""10.1524/9783050081151"", ""10.1007/978-3-476-00818-3_6"", ""10.1080/01916599.2018.1466185"", ""10.3790/978-3-428-54092-1"", ""10.1515/9781501730665"", ""10.3790/978-3-428-53457-9"", ""10.3790/978-3-428-54486-8"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511763083"", ""10.1524/9783050081151"", ""10.3817/1217181009"", ""10.3790/978-3-428-47987-0"", ""10.1525/rep.2003.83.1.67"", ""10.1111/hith.12014""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

To ensure that newly gathered geographical knowledge of Xinjiang was usable for the emperor and senior officials, technocrats and artisans in the Imperial Household Department collaborated with the Jesuits and border officials to produce maps that materialized it. Because of their utility in military campaigns and everyday governance, these maps were carefully maintained by the Imperial Household Department, which discreetly distributed them to a small coterie of Manchu and Mongol statesmen. Nevertheless, information leakage from the lower echelons of the bureaucracy challenged the department's monopoly and popularized knowledge of Xinjiang among the Han literati.","[{""name"": ""Xue Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9780804779951"", ""10.1163/9789004345362"", ""10.1080/07075332.1998.9640823"", ""10.4159/9780674042025"", ""10.1353/late.2011.0012"", ""10.1177/009770049902500403"", ""10.1353/late.1999.0008"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674434660"", ""10.1353/late.2001.0002"", ""10.1515/9781503619661"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1tfjc28.13"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226184869.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Their books discuss the territorial partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan in 1947, the framing and inauguration of the Indian Constitution in 1950, the preparation of voter rolls and the first democratic elections, and linguistic reorganisation of Indian states in 1956, alongside questions of refugee rehabilitation, counterinsurgency measures and rising ethnonationalisms. The emphasis is not only on the legal regimes of national citizenship, but also how it is unevenly mapped and experienced. This emphasis on territoriality is an invitation to ask questions about continuity and change in the transition from empires to nation-states, as well as invented pasts and imagined futures that transcend national borders set up after the end of colonial rule.","[{""name"": ""Kalyani Ramnath"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/00382876-8795890"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139795364"", ""10.1080/10350330.2011.535673"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558856"", ""10.1093/jrs/fes030"", ""10.1017/S0021911817000808"", ""10.1017/S0738248020000012"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107585737"", ""10.1515/9780295806549"", ""10.1017/9781108348553"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511497384"", ""10.1215/08992363-11-3-527"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674074163"", ""10.1017/9781108164511"", ""10.2307/2658391"", ""10.1093/pastj/gty045"", ""10.1525/9780520943377"", ""10.7135/UPO9781843318071"", ""10.1515/9781503614550"", ""10.1353/imp.2018.0058"", ""10.1017/9781108348553"", ""10.1177/001946460404100102"", ""10.1017/S002191181400045X"", ""10.1080/03086534.2013.768094"", ""10.5040/9781350038660"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9493.1996.tb00082.x"", ""10.1093/icon/moaa077"", ""10.1525/9780520918795"", ""10.1080/1369801X.2016.1231586"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198066743.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781351188234"", ""10.1017/S0021911815001552"", ""10.1093/iclqaj/1.Pt4.504"", ""10.1353/imp.2018.0060"", ""10.1017/S0026749X17000981"", ""10.1017/S0026749X12000613"", ""10.1353/jwh.2019.0011"", ""10.1215/1089201X-2773839"", ""10.1525/california/9780520274204.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00856401.2019.1554489"", ""10.1515/9781503611290"", ""10.1080/08865655.2015.1106332"", ""10.1080/00856401.2019.1555874"", ""10.4324/9781315660066"", ""10.1086/ahr.116.4.987"", ""10.1093/ahr/117.5.1461"", ""10.1017/S174002281300048X"", ""10.1017/9781316796894"", ""10.1080/00856401.2019.1554618"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195683776.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316104620"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtq027"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316154953"", ""10.1080/13621025.2011.564804"", ""10.1080/09584935.2011.569700""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This work has deepened our understanding of the development and impact of Rawls's ideas and of the broader contours of twentieth-century analytical political philosophy. This article places these recent archival histories, for the first time, in the context of the longer history of attempts to historicize Rawls, beginning with the publication ofA Theory of Justicefifty years ago. Doing so does three things. First, it shows that early readers were more interested in how to think historically about Rawls than is sometimes assumed. Second, it reveals that partisan accounts of Rawls's place in history, popularized by those close to him, have sometimes made their way into the archival studies. Third and finally, it offers an opportunity to rethink how the twentieth-century history of political philosophy and political theory is often told.","[{""name"": ""Sophie Smith"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2127966"", ""10.1353/jhi.2019.0012"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226201184.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2145603"", ""10.2307/2218002"", ""10.1177/0090591707307325"", ""10.5840/harvardreview1991115"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-032211-214411"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.1980.tb00277.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190633691.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9780470775677"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.1960.tb01124.x"", ""10.4159/9780674042605"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195377293.001.0001"", ""10.1177/009059177700500414""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

However, historical and anthropological scholarship has argued they have had outsized political roles, especially during high colonialism when transnational corporations such as the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company shaped colonial entities. This article explores the case of American mining company Freeport-McMoRan, which runs the world’s largest gold and copper mine in West Papua, and its entanglement with contemporary imperial and colonial projects in the region. Through the study of the company’s decisive role in the transfer of West Papua from the Dutch to Indonesia during the decolonization period of the 1960s, and in the formation of the postcolonial Indonesian state characterized by its militaristic and capitalistic stances, this article argues that Freeport’s operation in West Papua has been central to shaping U.S. imperial policy in Southeast Asia. The company’s relationship with the U.S. government and its contract of work with the Indonesian government reproduce an older form of state-corporation partnership called a charter, which grants a corporate body privileges associated with exploration, trade, and colonization. Combining a historical study of the political role of corporations across time and an ethnographic study of Freeport’s operation, this article rethinks the anthropological and historical study of transnational corporations and their roles in the contemporary politics of colonialism.","[{""name"": ""Veronika Kusumaryati"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/657907"", ""10.1163/9789004302518"", ""10.1215/9780822387992"", ""10.1515/9780824844417"", ""10.1515/9780804781619"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195393736.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0268580900015002005"", ""10.1525/9780520957596""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S0020859020000103,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,"Freedom of Movement, Access to the Urban Centres, and Abolition of Slavery in the French Caribbean","AbstractHow did the abolition of slavery influence the relations between urban centres and rural areas? How did “new” French citizens experience access to the urban environment? Based on the archives of the correctional courts, this article focuses on how race and citizenship determined the accessibility of French colonial urban spaces and institutions after 1848. The abolition of slavery in the French Antilles on 27 April 1848 led to a modification of the legal and judicial systems: the changing legal status of former slaves gave them new opportunities to move around the colonies, at least on paper. In theory, after 1848, everyone should have had freedom of social and spatial mobility and access to the urban centres and their institutions; what happened in practice, however, still needs to be researched. This article shows that the abolition exacerbated two dynamics already at play since the beginning of the nineteenth century: the control of the population and the attraction of the urban environment for the elite. The plantation system in the mid-nineteenth century was suffering both economically and politically: the newly acquired freedom and possible migration of former slaves to the towns (Saint-Pierre and Fort-de-France in Martinique, Pointe-à-Pitre and Basse-Terre in Guadeloupe) threatened to destabilize the system of private justice as well as the economic apparatus. To counteract these legal changes, vagrancy laws were implemented to restrict citizens’ mobility while, at the same time, the white elite's discourse on urban spaces changed from them being seen as a hotbed for revolutionary ideas to representing a safe environment to which access needed to be restricted.","[{""name"": ""Marion Pluskota"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0021853712000680"", ""10.3917/droit.052.0045"", ""10.3406/hes.1989.1529"", ""10.56021/9780801854965"", ""10.1080/01440399408575129"", ""10.3406/outre.1960.1315"", ""10.1080/13621020500525928"", ""10.3406/outre.1987.2600"", ""10.2307/1534924"", ""10.3406/outre.1987.2590"", ""10.1017/jlr.2017.44"", ""10.1215/00161071-2006-013"", ""10.3406/outre.2003.4014"", ""10.1108/09513571111155537"", ""10.3406/onoma.2002.1432"", ""10.3406/outre.1998.3656"", ""10.3917/rhj.016.0075"", ""10.1017/S0395264900017716"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139135146"", ""10.9783/9780812203561""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

They are a convenient operational model to treat robustness against uncertainties. A typical objective is to find the parameter values that maximize the reachability of some target states. In this paper, we consider automatically proving robustness, that is, an$$\varepsilon $$ε-close upper bound on the maximal reachability probability. The result of our procedure actually provides an almost-optimal parameter valuation along with this upper bound.We propose to tackle these ETR-hard problems by a tight combination of two significantly different techniques: monotonicity checking and parameter lifting. The former builds a partial order on states to check whether a pMC is (local or global) monotonic in a certain parameter, whereas parameter lifting is an abstraction technique based on the iterative evaluation of pMCs without parameter dependencies. We explain our novel algorithmic approach and experimentally show that we significantly improve the time to determine almost-optimal synthesis.","[{""name"": ""Jip Spel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Junges"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joost-Pieter Katoen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/SRDS.2017.22"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_28"", ""10.1007/s00236-016-0265-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17465-1_10"", ""10.1109/TASE.2013.20"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-31862-0_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-20398-5_12"", ""10.1007/s10009-010-0146-x"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.256.2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_28"", ""10.1145/2933575.2934574"", ""10.1007/s00165-006-0015-2"", ""10.1007/s11241-017-9269-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46520-3_4"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22152-1_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31784-3_28""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"
10.1017/S0020859019000567,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,"Female Workers in the Spanish Mines, 1860-1936","AbstractThis article analyses female labour in Spanish mines during the golden age of the sector in Spain between 1860 and 1936. Although they were a small percentage of total employment, women accounted for a significant share of the workforce in certain Spanish districts. On the one hand, the study quantifies work performed directly by women, who were mostly engaged in preparation and concentration of the minerals, as well as the extent of female child labour. This has been done by using official statistics, analysing the share of women employed for each type of mineral extracted, the mining area where this activity took place, and other variables. In the article, the authors seek to identify possible causes of such a heterogeneous distribution of female labour in the mining industry in Spain. This situation was common in the sector throughout the world. On the other hand, the article analyses attitudes of institutions, unions, and the like that limited employment opportunities for women in mining (banning them from performing underground tasks and other activities) and even proposed excluding them altogether, responding to workers’ demands in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. We examine the objectives pursued by these institutions, which in some cases related to protection (physical and moral) of female workers but overall aimed mainly to preserve the social role of women (particularly reproduction) and exclude them from the workforce. The pressure on female workers was the most pronounced in the workplace. These factors gave rise to a global setback in female employment, especially among the youngest workers. Given this situation, the quantitative data used, together with information drawn from different sources, reveal that women resisted giving up these jobs, particularly in the districts with a larger share of female workers.","[{""name"": ""Miguel Á.

It focuses on four political thinkers—Radhakumud Mookerji (1884–1964), Brajendranath Seal (1864–1938), Radhakamal Mukerjee (1889–1968), and Beni Prasad (1900–1945)—all of whom were central figures in a genre of federalist historiography of premodern Indian politics which emerged in the 1910s. The article interprets these thinkers as critics of the Indian nationalist movement's embrace of electoral government in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Through a contextual reading of their major written works in the late 1910s and the 1920s, the article traces the rise of a distinct theory of federalist constitutionalism, modelled on premodern state structures and oriented towards the legislative empowerment of local citizens’ assemblies.","[{""name"": ""Tejas Parasher"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139084451"", ""10.1215/1089201X-23-1-2-271"", ""10.1080/02666030.1997.9628530"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511659935"", ""10.1017/S0026749X17000981"", ""10.1017/S0018246X19000712"", ""10.1017/S1479244312000194"", ""10.1353/imp.2018.0059"", ""10.1017/S0018246X1600056X"", ""10.1017/S1479244310000119"", ""10.1017/S0010417511000594"", ""10.1017/S0738248016000195"", ""10.1080/09592296.2013.762881"", ""10.7312/aydi13778"", ""10.1080/13688790.2011.563459"", ""10.1093/ehr/XXXV.CXXXVIII.260"", ""10.5040/9780755625772""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Changes in the Diem framework must be successfully verified before being integrated into the open source repository on GitHub.","[{""name"": ""David Dill"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wolfgang Grieskamp"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Junkil Park"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shaz Qadeer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Meng Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emma Zhong"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3360573"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_32"", ""10.1007/11804192_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69149-5_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36946-9_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41600-3_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-44914-8_9"", ""10.1109/MS.2017.4121212"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_20"", ""10.1109/INDIN.2018.8471992"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2921624"", ""10.1145/2976749.2978309"", ""10.1145/2692956.2663188"", ""10.1109/2.161279"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1145/3274694.3274743"", ""10.1109/ASE.2015.77"", ""10.1145/3243734.3243780"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_7""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"
10.1017/S0020859020000152,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,"Families, Manumission, and Freed People in Urban Minas Gerais in the Era of Atlantic Abolitionism","AbstractLate eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Minas Gerais was heavily reliant on its slave labor force and invested in the social order shaped by slavery. The main systematic challenge to slavery was discrete negotiations of manumission that resulted in the freedom of a few individual slaves. This practice fueled the expansion of a free population of African descendants, who congregated most visibly in the captaincy's urban centers. Through an examination of manumission stories from two African-descendant families in the towns of Sabará and São José, this article underscores the relevance of family ties and social networks to the pursuit and experience of freedom in the region. As slavery remained entrenched in Brazil, despite Atlantic abolitionist efforts elsewhere, urban families’ pursuit and negotiation of manumissions shaped a historical process that naturalized the idea and possibility of black freedom.","[{""name"": ""Mariana L.R.

In this paper, we explore this issue showing that major earthquakes in Chile have become a window of opportunity for important fiscal reforms. Our findings indicate that there are two mechanisms to explain this relationship: first, reconstruction demands greater state expenditure and intervention; and second, the emergence of narratives that justify these reforms, such as patriotism and solidarity. However, data show that in the case of Chile, changes following disasters have had little impact on the overall tax structure of the country, and the historical preference for indirect taxes has been maintained, with limited power to impose taxes on high-income groups.","[{""name"": ""Magdalena Gil"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jorge Atria"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226185033.003.0004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511627071"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139087230"", ""10.1111/1467-856X.00104"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2867898"", ""10.1111/roiw.12441"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1817292"", ""10.1177/0094582X16648955"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226749198.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9780804766715"", ""10.1017/S0023879100016599"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-4475"", ""10.1017/S0026749X06002137"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511627071.009"", ""10.1080/03906701.2019.1532653"", ""10.5089/9781451875355.001"", ""10.1017/S0026749X06002010"", ""10.1785/gssrl.75.3.368"", ""10.1215/00182168-2006-129"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628283.008"", ""10.1353/lar.2004.0014"", ""10.1177/0739456X8100100110"", ""10.14506/ca30.2.09"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77h28"", ""10.1596/978-0-8213-6650-9"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691162911.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198287650.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.19.080193.001115"", ""10.1093/jsh/shx021"", ""10.1080/1362102042000214705"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043229"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2008.02.005"", ""10.4324/9780203821190"", ""10.1023/B:PUCH.0000035863.94599.97""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

The 52 burials found included 17 decapitated bodies and 13 prone burials – far higher than the British average. In two cases, cut marks show decapitation to have been the mechanism of death, and cuts on two other bodies indicate they experienced extreme violence. We conclude that the decapitations were the result of judicial execution. The significance of the prone burials is less clear, but it is demonstrably related to decapitation.

To capture the multiplicity and instability of state membership, I introduce the phrase “legal belonging”--a neutral, umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of bonds between individuals and states (usually referred to as subjecthood, nationality, or citizenship). Adopting the methods of global legal history, I look at how laws regulating legal belonging responded to the extraterritorial context of the Mediterranean in both European and Middle Eastern states. In so doing, I offer an alternative to the centrifugal narrative of modernization, which presumes that modern citizenship was invented in Europe and then exported to the Islamic world. Instead, I contend that the evolution of legal belonging on both sides of the Mediterranean developed in response to the challenges and opportunities presented by extraterritoriality. The article consists of two cases studies: first, I look at the regulation of legal belonging in Tunisia, the Ottoman Empire, and Morocco, arguing that this legislation responded to the challenges posed by extraterritoriality. Second, I examine the influence of extraterritorial regimes on the nationality of Algerians under French colonial rule.","[{""name"": ""Jessica M.

10.1017/S0165115321000243,ITINERARIO-JOURNAL OF IMPERIAL AND GLOBAL INTERACTIONS,0603 World History,"Exile, Mobility, and Re-territorialisation in Aceh and Colonial Indonesia","For centuries, trading companies and colonial officials have sought to manipulate indigenous Asian kingdoms by banishing recalcitrant elites, thereby discouraging resistance and ensuring compliance. Less examined by scholars is how colonial officials adapted this tool in their efforts to manage mobility and achieve territorialisation at the turn of the twentieth century. Applying Josiah Heyman and Howard Campbell's framework of “re-territorialisation” to make sense of how states harness mobile flows for the purpose of redrawing boundaries and producing new political spaces, this article will examine Dutch strategies for incorporating the sultanate of Aceh into the Netherlands East Indies. Site of an infamous multi-decade war of insurgency and pacification between 1873 and the early 1900s, this Sumatran kingdom had long resisted imperial subjugation. Dutch authorities eventually moved to complete its elusive ambition of conquest by leveraging distance and forcibly sending Acehnese elites to “training schools” in Java. By fusing exile with pedagogy, colonial officials hoped to transform Acehnese elites into loyal servants of the colonial centre. Rancorous debates about the deposed Acehnese sultan, however, illustrated the limitations of such re-territorialisation schemes and the resiliency of alternative Asian geographies.","[{""name"": ""Joshua Gedacht"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0020859018000226"", ""10.1163/9789004407671_014"", ""10.1177/1463499609105474"", ""10.1017/S0165115321000255"", ""10.1080/1479027042000236652"", ""10.1017/S0165115321000279"", ""10.1017/S0041977X00013823"", ""10.21313/hawaii/9780824853747.003.0005"", ""10.21313/hawaii/9780824853747.003.0002"", ""10.1017/S0165115321000231"", ""10.1515/9789048522019"", ""10.1163/22134379-90003842"", ""10.21313/hawaii/9780824853747.003.0007"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77k9j"", ""10.1017/S0021911817000900"", ""10.1017/S0165115321000292"", ""10.7765/9781526113429"", ""10.21313/hawaii/9780824853747.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108648189"", ""10.1163/9789004489561_004"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139057554"", ""10.1017/S0165115321000267"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wpmb1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

This theory has proven to be useful in a wide range of applications in academia and industry. To accommodate the expressive nature of string constraints used in those applications, string solvers use a multi-layered architecture where extended operators are reduced to a set of core operators. These reductions, however, are often costly to reason about. In this work, we propose new techniques for eagerly discovering conflicts based on equality reasoning and lazily avoiding reductions for certain extended functions based on lightweight reasoning. We present a strategy for integrating and scheduling these techniques in a CDCL$$(T)$$ ( T ) -based theory solver for strings and regular expressions. We implement the techniques and the strategy in cvc5, a state-of-the-art SMT solver, and show that they lead to a significant performance improvement.""Image missing""""Image missing""","[{""name"": ""Andres Nötzli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrew Reynolds"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Haniel Barbosa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clark Barrett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cesare Tinelli"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3140587.3062384"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8602997"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_9"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8602994"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99524-9_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_11"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2017.8102241"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-00768-2_27"", ""10.1145/3368089.3409728"", ""10.1145/3290362"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-18275-4_18"", ""10.1145/2377656.2377662"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-03077-7_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_43"", ""10.1145/2914770.2837641"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-90870-6_21"", ""10.1145/322186.322198"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-32033-3_33"", ""10.1145/1217856.1217859"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25543-5_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_24"", ""10.1109/SP.2010.38"", ""10.1109/TAIC.PART.2007.34"", ""10.1145/2660267.2660372"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-16242-8_45"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-17511-4_24"", ""10.1145/2491411.2491456""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Software', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

The occasion was a forum in the American Historical Review on ‘historiographic “turns” in critical perspective’. The perspectives offered were critical enough, Thomas wrote in praise of the other authors, but the forum had a blind spot: ‘alongside the turns analyzed here, a world-altering force has been emerging, one larger, more devastating, and more definitive even than “contemporary flexible forms of capitalism”: I speak of climate change – or climate collapse – and all of its related global transformations’. Since then, some intersectional scholars have gone beyond that to argue that climate collapse and racial capitalism are not separate topics at all, but are bound together by white supremacy and lingering forms of European imperialism. Over the past decade some environmental historians have grappled with these connections and deployed new frameworks for thinking about scale, the interdependence of the local and the global, the implications of a Euro-centric analytical framework for our understanding of the world and the relationship between economic systems and environmental change. Although they have developed separately, both environmental history and global history have called upon historians of Europe to rethink boundary making in their methodologies and in their categories of analysis.

Evidence from anti-epidemic campaigns shows public debates broadly comparable to the current COVID-19 crisis: debates about the measurably higher mortality rates for indigenous people and other marginalized groups; debates about the extent of the state’s responsibility for the health of its peoples; and debates on whether or not coercion and violence should be used to ensure compliance with quarantines and public health campaigns. While inoculations provided medical assistance and material help to Maya communities, and resulted in demonstrably lower mortality rates from smallpox, at the same time they functioned as avenues for the expansion of colonial power to intervene in the daily lives of people in those communities, characterized by colonial actors as necessary for their own good, and for the broader public good.","[{""name"": ""Martha Few"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']",['Genetics'],"[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0710 生物学', 0.733), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7315)]]"

As micro-controllers rarely feature hardware memory protection, the isolation of eBPF virtual machines (VM) is critical to ensure system integrity against potentially malicious programs. This paper shows how to directly derive, within the Coq proof assistant, the verified C implementation of an eBPF virtual machine from a Gallina specification. Leveraging the formal semantics of the CompCert C compiler, we obtain an end-to-end theorem stating that the C code of our VM inherits the safety and security properties of the Gallina specification. Our refinement methodology ensures that the isolation property of the specification holds in the verified C implementation.

Sassafras root was a major anti-febrile medicament in the early modern world. The history of that medicament has thus far primarily been written in terms of the Spanish empire, which commodified it in post-contact Eurasia. Yet Native Americans, in particular the Timucua, as well as the French, the British, and the Russians, all played major roles in the history of sassafras. That history involves several objects derived from the tree sometimes called sassafras, knowledge about those objects, and Eurasian ideas about the Americas. This article focuses on the issues of entangled empires, and commodity and knowledge exchanges, to show that early modern commodities were not unitary objects, but rather shifting entanglements of objects, words, and ideas.","[{""name"": ""Clare Griffin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/02549948.1993.11731242"", ""10.1080/03085694.2013.731201"", ""10.1057/9781137323675"", ""10.1017/S1740022815000327"", ""10.1093/shm/hkr055"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1djmdgj"", ""10.1017/9781108628600"", ""10.1353/book.72063"", ""10.1163/15733823-02123p06"", ""10.1086/652694"", ""10.1163/187633111X594560"", ""10.2307/602594"", ""10.1007/s00606-007-0550-1"", ""10.2307/360282"", ""10.4324/9780203933848"", ""10.1017/S0025727300068046"", ""10.1163/9789047405528"", ""10.1163/9789047401209"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195391282.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0080440111000065"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1f89t3p"", ""10.1017/mdh.2014.70"", ""10.1353/book.1780"", ""10.1353/eam.2017.0016"", ""10.11647/OBP.0122.08"", ""10.1093/shm/hkt010"", ""10.1057/9780230625310"", ""10.1525/9780520947573"", ""10.1353/bhm.2015.0099"", ""10.9783/9780812294699"", ""10.1353/eal.2018.0044"", ""10.1163/187633110X510428"", ""10.1515/9781400832606"", ""10.1353/kri.2013.0013"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300117967.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203875735""]",['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Existing approaches for incremental verification hard-code specific verification techniques. Some of the approaches must be tightly intertwined with the development process. To solve this open problem, we present the concept of difference verification with conditions. Difference verification with conditions is independent from any specific verification technique and can be integrated in software projects at any time. It first applies a change analysis that detects which parts of a software were changed between revisions and encodes that information in a condition. Based on this condition, an off-the-shelf verifier is used to verify only those parts of the software that are influenced by the changes. As a proof of concept, we propose a simple, syntax-based change analysis and use difference verification with conditions with three off-the-shelf verifiers. An extensive evaluation shows the competitiveness of difference verification with conditions.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marie-Christine Jakobs"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas Lemberger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_12"", ""10.1145/2771783.2771802"", ""10.1145/2568225.2568243"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39176-7_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03421-4_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_16"", ""10.1007/s10009-007-0044-z"", ""10.1145/2393596.2393664"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73368-3_51"", ""10.5281/zenodo.3954933"", ""10.1145/3180155.3180259"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16"", ""10.1145/2491411.2491429"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-23404-5_12"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2013.11.026"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606576"", ""10.1145/73560.73584"", ""10.1109/ASE.2017.8115630"", ""10.1145/3183440.3183493"", ""10.1007/s10703-015-0237-0"", ""10.1145/876638.876643"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_21"", ""10.1145/2642937.2642987"", ""10.1145/1629911.1630034"", ""10.1002/stvr.1472"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-03237-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2"", ""10.1145/964001.964021"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-39910-0_16"", ""10.1145/503272.503279"", ""10.1109/ICSM.1994.336770"", ""10.1145/2771783.2771806"", ""10.1145/2491411.2491452"", ""10.4230/DagRep.8.4.1"", ""10.1145/1882362.1882405"", ""10.1145/1368088.1368128"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-45069-6_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54804-8_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38856-9_14"", ""10.1145/1453101.1453131"", ""10.1145/1993498.1993558"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_55"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99725-4_22"", ""10.1109/ICSM.2012.6405261"", ""10.1145/567067.567084"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41103-9_5"", ""10.1007/3-540-58179-0_67"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69149-5_54"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48989-6_39"", ""10.1145/3276509"", ""10.1145/2970276.2970298"", ""10.1145/2393596.2393665"", ""10.1109/ICSM.2009.5306334"", ""10.1145/2338965.2336771""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Software', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

Even for applications with extremely regular and homogeneous compute-communicate phases, simply adding communication time to computation time does often not yield a satisfactory prediction of parallel runtime due to deviations from the expected simple lockstep pattern caused by system noise, variations in communication time, and inherent load imbalance. In this paper, we highlight the specific cases of provoked and spontaneous desynchronization of memory-bound, bulk-synchronous pure MPI and hybrid MPI+OpenMP programs. Using simple microbenchmarks we observe that although desynchronization can introduce increased waiting time per process, it does not necessarily cause lower resource utilization but can lead to an increase in available bandwidth per core. In case of significant communication overhead, even natural noise can shove the system into a state of automatic overlap of communication and computation, improving the overall time to solution. The saturation point, i.e., the number of processes per memory domain required to achieve full memory bandwidth, is pivotal in the dynamics of this process and the emerging stable wave pattern. We also demonstrate how hybrid MPI-OpenMP programming can prevent desirable desynchronization by eliminating the bandwidth bottleneck among processes. A Chebyshev filter diagonalization application is used to demonstrate some of the observed effects in a realistic setting.","[{""name"": ""Ayesha Afzal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Georg Hager"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gerhard Wellein"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/CLUSTER.2019.8890995"", ""10.1145/2503210.2503247"", ""10.1145/2934661"", ""10.1016/j.jocs.2010.05.001"", ""10.1145/2807591.2807672"", ""10.1016/S0167-8191(06)80021-9"", ""10.1145/1851476.1851564"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92040-5_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92040-5_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92040-5_17"", ""10.1109/IPDPS.2015.76"", ""10.1109/IPDPS.2016.48"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.91.013306"", ""10.1145/1048935.1050204"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2016.08.027"", ""10.1109/PDP.2009.43"", ""10.1145/2751205.2751240"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92040-5_13"", ""10.1145/1498765.1498785""]",['Computer Science'],"['Hardware and Architecture', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

10.1017/S073824801900049X,LAW AND HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0301 Law,Cultural Expertise and Law: An Historical Overview,"The use of anthropology and sociology for dispute resolution, law-making, and governance has been frequent throughout the history of law and anthropology. Anthropological expertise in the form of expert witnessing or expert information, has been one among the significant activities of applied anthropology. However, no concept such the one of cultural expertise was formulated to theorise the engagement of anthropologists and sociologists with law. This paper adopts an historical approach in order to understand why socio-legal studies have not developed a conceptualisation that encompasses the variety of the types of engagement of social scientists, and anthropologists in particular. It investigates the connection between law and culture in the history of anthropology of law since social evolutionism, and focuses in particular on legal pluralism. This paper suggests that the reasons for the late conceptualisation of cultural expertise lies on the one hand in the difficulty to define the dynamics between law and culture, and on the other hand in the specific development of legal pluralism vis-à-vis the state. This paper concludes with a reformulation of the concept of cultural expertise as an umbrella concept that encompasses the existing array of socio-legal instruments that use cultural knowledge for conflict resolution.","[{""name"": ""Livia Holden"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/40344831"", ""10.1177/002200276701100102"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.09.080183.000535"", ""10.4324/9781843147909"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004162457.i-241"", ""10.1108/S1059-433720190000078001"", ""10.1080/20414005.2010.11424502"", ""10.1093/icon/mor071"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490330"", ""10.4324/9781315250557"", ""10.7591/9781501723322"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1784804"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139871532.003"", ""10.1177/0964663904040192"", ""10.1007/s12108-001-1016-5"", ""10.1177/1743872111412718"", ""10.1515/9781400840991"", ""10.2307/3772986"", ""10.2307/3053348"", ""10.1023/A:1010745105521"", ""10.2307/2128074"", ""10.2307/j.ctv102bhb9"", ""10.2307/1158394"", ""10.1111/j.1747-4469.2004.tb00333.x"", ""10.2307/3052961"", ""10.4324/9780203818305"", ""10.1525/pol.2007.30.2.352"", ""10.2307/3053638"", ""10.21119/anamps.22.187-268"", ""10.2307/1410167"", ""10.1007/s12115-013-9634-4"", ""10.1086/291595"", ""10.1080/07329113.2013.773804"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2230.1967.tb01157.x"", ""10.1080/07329113.2006.10756597"", ""10.1111/j.1748-121X.1988.tb00642.x"", ""10.1525/aa.1951.53.1.02a00030"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226484532.001.0001"", ""10.1086/692991""]","['Social Sciences', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Soil Science', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7714), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7605)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

However, many real-world models have discrete or hybrid discrete-continuous distributions, for which existing tools may suffer non-trivial limitations. Inference and parameter estimation can be exceedingly slow for these models because many inference algorithms compute results faster (or exclusively) when the distributions being inferred are continuous. To address this discrepancy, this paper presents Leios. Leios is the first approach for systematically approximating arbitrary probabilistic programs that have discrete, or hybrid discrete-continuous random variables. The approximate programs have all their variables fully continualized. We show that once we have the fully continuous approximate program, we can perform inference and parameter estimation faster by exploiting the existing support that many languages offer for continuous distributions. Furthermore, we show that the estimates obtained when performing inference and parameter estimation on the continuous approximation are still comparably close to both the true parameter values and the estimates obtained when performing inference on the original model.","[{""name"": ""Jacob Laurel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sasa Misailovic"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2525708"", ""10.1145/3133904"", ""10.1023/A:1015408218938"", ""10.2307/2530415"", ""10.1201/b18502-5"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_35"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89884-1_6"", ""10.1080/01621459.2017.1285773"", ""10.1080/01621459.1981.10477739"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_14"", ""10.1145/2535838.2535859"", ""10.1145/2240236.2240262"", ""10.1145/1809028.1806629"", ""10.1090/S0002-9904-1949-09223-6"", ""10.1198/0003130043286"", ""10.1016/0004-3702(90)90060-D"", ""10.1017/9781108770750.002"", ""10.1137/19M1301047"", ""10.1109/32.90437"", ""10.1145/3338906.3338972"", ""10.1214/aoms/1177731058"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_4"", ""10.1198/016214504000000458"", ""10.1145/2593882.2593900"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7503.003.0076"", ""10.1145/2594291.2594303"", ""10.1145/512927.512945"", ""10.1016/0022-0000(81)90036-2"", ""10.1609/aaai.v28i1.9006"", ""10.26226/morressier.604907f41a80aac83ca25d52"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139087759"", ""10.1145/3371087"", ""10.1016/S0169-7161(05)25016-2"", ""10.1145/229542.229547"", ""10.1145/3088525.3088564"", ""10.1145/3374208"", ""10.1201/b10905-6"", ""10.1145/2737924.2737982"", ""10.1162/neco.2008.08-07-592"", ""10.1145/2499370.2462179"", ""10.1609/aaai.v26i1.8406"", ""10.1016/S0047-259X(02)00067-2"", ""10.1145/3064899.3064910"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-4493-1"", ""10.1145/3192366.3192408"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2019.09.016""]",['Computer Science'],['Artificial Intelligence'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

The text uncovers the interwar and communist conceptual premises upon which the biographies of fascist martyrs for canonisation as saints by the Romanian Orthodox Church were shaped. As martyrs for the Christian faith, those deceased were depicted as respectable figures, showcasing their martyrdom on the same moral footing as the dissidents of former democratic parties opposing communism. Furthermore, the narrative strategies in shaping a fascist hagiography from the interwar up to the post-communist years stand as another critical issue for the present article.","[{""name"": ""Ionuț Biliuță"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/14690760701571155"", ""10.1111/0036-0341.00173"", ""10.7202/1033881ar""]",['Psychology'],['Social Psychology'],"[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

10.1017/S000964072100216X,CHURCH HISTORY,0603 World History; 0101 Philosophy,An Evangelical is Anyone who Likes Billy Graham: Defining Evangelicalism with Carl Henry and Networks of Trust,"AbstractThe founding editors of Christianity Today spent more than a year planning the launch of their magazine. Carl F. H. Henry, L. Nelson Bell, and J. Marcellus Kik believed Christianity Today could “plant the flag” for evangelicalism. To do that, though, the editors had to decide what evangelicalism was. They had to decide where the lines were, who was in and who was out, which issues mattered and which did not. One key criterion, they decided, was whether or not someone liked evangelist Billy Graham. Historian George Marsden later offered this as a tongue-in-cheek definition of evangelicalism. More seriously, religious historians have used David Bebbington's quadrilateral definition, which says the basis of evangelicalism is conversionism, biblicism, activism, and crucicentrism. This article argues that Bebbington's definition is ahistorical, vague, and deeply unhelpful. Marsden's joking definition, on the other hand, is quite useful, as it directs historians to attend to actual relationships, historical affinities, and real-world conversations. Based on new archival research, this article tells the story of the launch of evangelicalism's “flagship” magazine, shows how evangelicalism's lines were drawn in 1956, and makes the case that evangelicalism is best understood as a discourse community which is structured by its communication networks.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Silliman"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This is a significant omission in the history of these movements: training turns civilians into soldiers and creates armies with not only military but also social and political effects, as scholarship on conventional militaries has long emphasized. Liberation movement armies were however different in that they were not subordinated to a single state, instead receiving training under the flexible rubric of international solidarity in a host of foreign sites and in interaction with a great variety of military traditions. The training provided in this context produced multiple “military imaginaries” within liberation movement armies, at once creating deep tensions and enabling innovation. The article is based on oral histories of Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) veterans trained by Cuban and Soviet instructors in Angola in the late 1970s. These soldiers emerged from the Angolan camps with a military imaginary they summed up in the Cuban exhortation “Adelante!” (Forward!). Forty years later, they stressed how different their training had made them from other ZIPRA cadres, in terms of their military strategy, mastery of advanced Soviet weaponry, and aggressive disposition, as well as their “revolutionary” performance of politics and masculinity in modes of address, salute, and drill. Such military imaginaries powerfully shaped the southern African battlefield. They offer novel insight into the distinctive institutions, identities, and memories forged through Cold War-era military exchanges.","[{""name"": ""Jocelyn Alexander"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joann McGregor"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0010417509000115"", ""10.1080/03057070.2011.602896"", ""10.1016/S0030-4387(99)80054-4"", ""10.3167/9781571811455"", ""10.4324/9780203081419"", ""10.1525/aa.2002.104.3.723"", ""10.1525/eth.1990.18.4.02a00060"", ""10.1177/0022009406062071"", ""10.1080/17531055.2017.1288419"", ""10.4324/9780203081419"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316162958"", ""10.4000/etudesafricaines.20728"", ""10.1525/9780520947900"", ""10.1215/9780822394488"", ""10.1080/03057070.2017.1272299"", ""10.1080/03057070.2017.1278982"", ""10.1093/hwj/57.1.79"", ""10.1177/0022009406062054"", ""10.1080/03057070.2014.886476"", ""10.1515/9783110642964-009"", ""10.1080/03057070.2020.1804123"", ""10.1057/s41292-018-0127-y"", ""10.1515/9780804777162"", ""10.1525/can.1997.12.4.527"", ""10.58331/UCTPRESS.47"", ""10.1515/9783110642964""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The belief that any small nation like Ireland, oppressed by a dominant neighbour, had the right to self-determination was of key importance in nationalist political rhetoric during the revolutionary years. Given the similarity of circumstances among newly independent small states, Irish commentators were aware of the struggles Ireland shared with the successors of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Personal encounters on the continent, as well as news regarding small nations in central Europe, shaped Irish opinions of the region. Certainly, the images presented by Irish commentators reflected their own political agendas and were therefore often deliberately idealistic. Nonetheless, they served a specific purpose as they were meant to further Ireland's interest on the international stage. Looking beyond Ireland for lessons and examples to follow became a frequent part of Irish nationalist political rhetoric. By directing scholarly attention to a hitherto less explored aspect of Irish historiography, this article aims to highlight the complexity of Ireland's connection with the continent within the framework of small nations, from a transnational perspective.","[{""name"": ""Lili Zách"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199583713.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Among these, Milton Friedman's negative income tax is one of the most successful ideas to establish a universal floor of income for every citizen. Elaborated in the early 1940s, it attracted widespread attention among economists and policy makers in the aftermath of Johnson's War on Poverty. This contribution will, however, focus on the intellectual setting under which Friedman envisioned a new way to think about poverty. Tracing back the origin of the proposal in the context of the New Deal, this article shows how Friedman hollowed out redistributive considerations from the hierarchies of needs, notions of duty, or citizenship that were common in the British welfarist conception and preexisting notions of equality where the state played a key role by replacing it with a monetary and market-friendly conception of poverty.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Zamora Vargas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/00182702-1504050"", ""10.1086/256579"", ""10.2307/2144462"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1qft0n6"", ""10.1515/9781400824748"", ""10.4159/9780674978072"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190212766.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805288"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801450488.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.socec.2004.09.050"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674067431.c5"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198813262.003.0003""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Finance', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

In letters that German citizens wrote to President Richard von Weizsäcker, it is clear that some Germans feared that the arrival of large numbers of non-Germans would bring about the collapse of the state or the destruction of the German people. This article engages with the history of fear in postwar Germany by examining Germans’ post-reunification fears of migration and foreigners. I argue, first, that a biological understanding of race was still surprisingly widespread as late as the early 1990s. Second, I call for a substantially more nuanced understanding of German reunification, one that emphasizes uncertainty and the terrifying openness of the future. Finally, I highlight the intersection of race thinking and memory by showing that racial fears were frequently shaped by memories of Germany's dark past.","[{""name"": ""Christopher A.

Well-worn racial tropes about drug use, cultivated in the imaginations of white commentators and pseudoscientists, railroaded African American suspects and contributed to the creation of the early apparatuses of the war on drugs. As observers increasingly connected the specter of cocaine “delirium” to common anxieties about Black crime and miscegenation, they in turn viewed white cocaine use as a solvable shortcoming in need of treatment rather than imprisonment. As such, New York City’s early civic responses to cocaine were shaped as Southern racial discourse collided with the developing panics of the Progressive Era that rallied around the increasing mobility of Black Americans in an effort to manage interracial contact through legislation.","[{""name"": ""Douglas Flowe"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226041490.001.0001"", ""10.1353/scu.2006.0031"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226684789.001.0001"", ""10.1093/maghis/6.2.25"", ""10.56021/9780801862304"", ""10.1353/jsh/32.1.27""]","['Social Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

James Buchanan, John Rawls and the Politics of the Social Contract","A striking aspect of the initial reception of John Rawls is that he was embraced by leading market-liberal theorists such as Friedrich Hayek and James Buchanan. This article investigates the reasons for the free-market right's sympathetic interest in the early Rawls by providing a historical account of the dialogue between Rawls and his key neoliberal interlocutor, James Buchanan. We set out the common intellectual context, notably the influence of Frank Knight, that framed the initial work of both Buchanan and Rawls and brought them together as seeming allies during the early 1960s. We then analyze a significant theoretical divergence between the two in the 1970s related to their contrasting responses to the politics of those years and to differences over the importance of ideal theory in political thought. The exchanges between Buchanan and Rawls demonstrate that Rawlsian liberalism and neoliberalism initially emerged as entwined critiques of mid-twentieth-century political economy but could not sustain that alliance when faced by the new claims for civil and social rights that became a marked feature of politics after the 1960s.","[{""name"": ""Ben Jackson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zofia Stemplowska"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/467541"", ""10.1017/S1479244309990163"", ""10.1017/S1479244315000268"", ""10.5840/jphil2006103517"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6435.1976.tb01958.x"", ""10.1080/08913811.2013.853859"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2004.00005.x"", ""10.1093/0199243956.001.0001"", ""10.1007/BF00154661"", ""10.1353/jhi.2017.0017"", ""10.1215/01903659-7271411"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674067431.c3"", ""10.1007/BF01718099"", ""10.1093/mind/LXXIV.296.554"", ""10.1257/jel.20181502"", ""10.1515/9780804763172"", ""10.1086/291559"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7295.1980.tb00557.x"", ""10.4159/9780674054264""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

One reason is that their haptic feedback are attempts at replicating physical button feedback instead of being designed specifically for interaction in mid air. We present an approach to haptics for mid-air buttons that extends the feedback beyond the fingertip. Our approach is inspired by recent findings that show how skin vibrations from fingertip presses extend to the whole hand. We apply the haptic feedback across the whole hand to simulate the pull-up effect that triggers users to withdraw their finger upon button activation. We conduct a user study with two tasks to evaluate the whole-hand feedback and compare it with prior work. Our results show that the whole-hand haptic feedback reduces the overall button press duration and allows for more successful button activations compared to the localized haptic feedback. We discuss the reasons behind the improved performance and further steps to improve mid-air presses.,"[{""name"": ""Martin Maunsbach"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kasper Hornbæk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hasti Seifi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3457141"", ""10.1145/3025453.3025457"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-93445-7_24"", ""10.1109/ROMAN.2009.5326299"", ""10.1109/WHC.2019.8816101"", ""10.1145/2501988.2502041"", ""10.1145/3173574.3173804"", ""10.1145/3173574.3174082"", ""10.1145/3382507.3418823"", ""10.1145/2821592.2821593"", ""10.1145/3239060.3239081"", ""10.1073/pnas.1520866113""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience', 'Engineering']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Social Psychology', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1017/S1479244320000530,MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Whatever Happened to the Social in American Social Thought? Part 2,"The liberal social thought of the long 1950s is best seen as an attempt to combat the threat that the United States, as a modern mass society, could succumb to totalitarianism. Widely discussed texts likeEscape from Freedom, The Vital Center, The Lonely Crowd, andThe Origins of Totalitarianismannounced the threat. Academic and theoretical studies worked to provide social supports for now weakened individuals or to find behavioral evidence that Americans still functioned as liberal democrats, but they did so by subordinating individual autonomy and mutual social responsibility to social systems, the market, and elites. Although social liberalism revived during the 1960s, the Great Society fused social liberalism to the Cold War state; the movements for civil rights and social inclusion, fueled by the desire for authenticity, veered into individualistic, identitarian channels; and radical calls for participatory democracy magnified both desires for authenticity and fears of American totalitarianism. Until the end of the century the totalitarian frame of liberal social thought continued to encourage visions of the future as a monolithic totality, to steer liberal social thinkers into individualistic channels, to hobble mutualistic conceptions of the social, and to weaken the ability of social liberals to respond to the conservative backlash that grew through the century and beyond.","[{""name"": ""Dorothy Ross"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226046778.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1479244315000268"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674067431"", ""10.1177/039219215300100301"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.03138-X"", ""10.2307/2076741"", ""10.4159/9780674042605"", ""10.7312/frie16258"", ""10.1177/039219216201003903"", ""10.1353/book.40889"", ""10.1525/9780520943445"", ""10.7312/katz11194-003"", ""10.1177/0952695102015004682"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300187854.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511527586"", ""10.4159/9780674054264"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674065222"", ""10.1525/9780520310315""]","['Social Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

It relies more on external, “international legal sovereignty,” than on internal, “Westphalian” and “domestic” sovereignty. While its Algerian operational base in the Tindouf refugee camps makes it work as a primarily extraterritorial state-in-exile de facto, the SADR maintains control over one quarter of Western Sahara’s territory proper allowing it to at least partially meet the requirements for declarative statehood de jure. Many case-specific nuances surround the internal sovereignty of the SADR in relation to criteria for statehood: territory, population, and government. However, examining this case in a comparative light reveals similarities with other (secessionist) parastates. The SADR exists within the context of a frozen conflict, where the stalemate has been reinforced by an ineffective internationally brokered peace settlement and the indefinite presence of international peacekeeping forces. Global powers have played a major role in prolonging the conflict’s status quo while the specific resilience of the SADR as a parastate has been ensured by support from Algeria as an external sponsor. The path to sovereignty appears to be blocked in every possible way.","[{""name"": ""Irene Fernández-Molina"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raquel Ojeda-García"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/14781158.2015.1075969"", ""10.4000/emam.859"", ""10.1093/ips/oly006"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-95035-5_13"", ""10.4324/9780203834510"", ""10.1080/14781158.2015.1083542"", ""10.1080/13629395.2014.966961"", ""10.1163/1875984X-00603005"", ""10.1017/S0022278X07002546"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw049"", ""10.1080/03932720903351104"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-95035-5"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-47182-6_11"", ""10.1080/13530194.2014.949220"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1j2n9vz"", ""10.5040/9781350987357"", ""10.1515/9780804764025"", ""10.1080/14781158.2015.1080234"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12234"", ""10.1080/13629387.2016.1174586"", ""10.1057/9780230234185"", ""10.11643/issn.2217-995X122SPZ21"", ""10.1080/13629395.2015.1033907"", ""10.1080/14781158.2015.1083541"", ""10.1177/0022343306068102"", ""10.1515/9781400823260"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000829"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-95035-5_9"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2014.09.001"", ""10.1007/s12142-008-0090-2"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-95035-5_14"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-95035-5_6"", ""10.1080/13629390500124333"", ""10.1080/14781158.2015.1080233"", ""10.1002/9781118661192"", ""10.1080/13629380600803001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Researchers also discovered multiple security issues associated with neural networks. One of them is backdoor attacks, i.e., a neural network may be embedded with a backdoor such that a target output is almost always generated in the presence of a trigger. Existing defense approaches mostly focus on detecting whether a neural network is ‘backdoored’ based on heuristics, e.g., activation patterns. To the best of our knowledge, the only line of work which certifies the absence of backdoor is based on randomized smoothing, which is known to significantly reduce neural network performance. In this work, we propose an approach to verify whether a given neural network is free of backdoor with a certain level of success rate. Our approach integrates statistical sampling as well as abstract interpretation. The experiment results show that our approach effectively verifies the absence of backdoor or generates backdoor triggers.","[{""name"": ""Long H.

Unfortunately, these policies are known to be susceptible to bugs. Despite significant progress in DNN verification, there has been little work demonstrating the use of modern verification tools on real-world, DRL-controlled systems. In this case study, we attempt to begin bridging this gap, and focus on the important task of mapless robotic navigation — a classic robotics problem, in which a robot, usually controlled by a DRL agent, needs to efficiently and safely navigate through an unknown arena towards a target. We demonstrate how modern verification engines can be used for effective model selection, i.e., selecting the best available policy for the robot in question from a pool of candidate policies. Specifically, we use verification to detect and rule out policies that may demonstrate suboptimal behavior, such as collisions and infinite loops. We also apply verification to identify models with overly conservative behavior, thus allowing users to choose superior policies, which might be better at finding shorter paths to a target. To validate our work, we conducted extensive experiments on an actual robot, and confirmed that the suboptimal policies detected by our method were indeed flawed. We also demonstrate the superiority of our verification-driven approach over state-of-the-art, gradient attacks. Our work is the first to establish the usefulness of DNN verification in identifying and filtering out suboptimal DRL policies in real-world robots, and we believe that the methods presented here are applicable to a wide range of systems that incorporate deep-learning-based agents.","[{""name"": ""Guy Amir"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Davide Corsi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raz Yerushalmi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luca Marzari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Harel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alessandro Farinelli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guy Katz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11797"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30823-9_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-26945-6_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_36"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2021/297"", ""10.1145/3319535.3354245"", ""10.1146/annurev-control-042920-020211"", ""10.1109/LRA.2019.2899918"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-5209-5"", ""10.1145/3302504.3311807"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.026"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-77935-5_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19"", ""10.1145/3452296.3472936"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.12107"", ""10.1109/SP.2018.00058"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1"", ""10.1145/3419742"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-13185-1_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.1007/s10703-021-00363-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26"", ""10.1145/3341216.3342218"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_16"", ""10.1609/aaai.v34i04.5932"", ""10.1609/aaai.v34i04.5944"", ""10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9635925"", ""10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20737"", ""10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196739"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.17"", ""10.1109/CENTCON52345.2021.9687937"", ""10.1109/LRA.2018.2869644"", ""10.1145/3290354"", ""10.1145/3302504.3311802"", ""10.1109/IROS.2017.8202134"", ""10.1609/aaai.v30i1.10295"", ""10.1016/j.neunet.2022.03.022"", ""10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8968004"", ""10.1109/IVS.2014.6856596"", ""10.1109/IROS.2017.8206049"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3084685""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

This article examines the patterns of retail diffusion that followed and the resultant adoption of the shopping centre form. Further, it considers the broader implications of retail innovation during a period of urban disruption, revealing intersections between urban geographies, business innovation and retail hierarchies. In the Australian case, dominant firms were able to leverage their market power to adapt to shifting retail geographies and new technologies, while some small entrepreneurial developers catering to the needs of these established retailers laid foundations for national and international expansion. A by-product of these processes was the creation of a unique Australian shopping centre form.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Bailey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/08111146.2014.975340"", ""10.1177/0096144202238869"", ""10.1017/S0963926815000449"", ""10.1108/JHRM-07-2015-0029"", ""10.1177/0096144212470244"", ""10.1080/08111149808727757"", ""10.1080/10331867.2012.685636"", ""10.4337/9781782542469.00028"", ""10.1080/14490854.2014.11668500"", ""10.1525/california/9780520286849.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781474267397"", ""10.1017/S0963926814000583"", ""10.1080/10331867.1999.10525119"", ""10.1177/02632760122051986"", ""10.2307/2169636"", ""10.1002/j.1839-4655.1980.tb00672.x"", ""10.1080/0042098983890"", ""10.1111/aehr.12107"", ""10.2307/2169634"", ""10.4324/9780203036464""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Urban Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Marketing']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

We show that each problem in this class reduces—non-deterministically in polynomial time—to the same problem for just finite automata. We also show an analogous reduction for automata that have access to both a pushdown stack and reversal-bounded counters (PRBCA).This allows us to answer several open questions: For example, we show that it is$$\textsf{coNP}$$coNP-complete to decide whether a given (P)RBCA languageLis bounded, meaning whether there exist words$$w_1,\ldots ,w_n$$w1,…,wnwith$$L\subseteq w_1^*\cdots w_n^*$$L⊆w1∗⋯wn∗. For PRBCA, even decidability was open. Our methods also show that there is no language of a (P)RBCA of intermediate growth. This means, the number of words of each length grows either polynomially or exponentially. Part of our proof is likely of independent interest: We show that one can translate an RBCA into a machine with$$\mathbb {Z}$$Z-counters in logarithmic space, while preserving the accepted language.","[{""name"": ""Pascal Baumann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Flavio D’Alessandro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Moses Ganardi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oscar Ibarra"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ian McQuillan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lia Schütze"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Georg Zetzsche"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0022-0000(74)80027-9"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2020.109"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2022.112"", ""10.48550/ARXIV.2301.10198"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2020.114"", ""10.1109/LICS52264.2021.9470527"", ""10.1051/ita/2012013"", ""10.1142/S0129054112400709"", ""10.1007/s00224-017-9817-2"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2020.10.006"", ""10.1016/0022-0000(88)90008-6"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2017.117"", ""10.1145/2933575.2934527"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2018.119"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2015.01.008"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21500-6_18"", ""10.1142/S0129054118400051"", ""10.3233/FI-1997-3112"", ""10.1109/LICS.2012.39"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(01)00282-1"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.FSTTCS.2019.40"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-85238-4_26"", ""10.1142/S0129054110007441"", ""10.1090/S0002-9947-1964-0181500-1"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(78)90020-8"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(98)00161-3"", ""10.1016/0022-0000(81)90028-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11439-2_9"", ""10.1109/LICS.2019.8785850 10.1109/LICS.2019.8785850"", ""10.1145/2837614.2837627"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_60"", ""10.1109/LICS.2017.8005141"", ""10.2977/prims/1195192738"", ""10.1007/BF01746517"", ""10.1145/322047.322058"", ""10.1007/3-540-16078-7_74"", ""10.1142/S0129054112400539"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(01)00268-7"", ""10.1016/S0890-5401(03)00087-7"", ""10.1007/3-540-45061-0_54"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2018.09.035"", ""10.1145/800070.802201"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17127-8_20"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(92)90173-D"", ""10.1109/LICS.2015.16"", ""10.1109/LICS.2019.8785796"", ""10.1145/800076.802477"", ""10.1145/321356.321364"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.FSTTCS.2017.45"", ""10.1007/3-540-53904-2_94"", ""10.1145/800105.803396"", ""10.1007/11532231_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-47666-6_35"", ""10.4230/IPIcs.ICALP.2016.123""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)]]"

While scholarship has mostly concentrated on trade and commerce, recent studies have shifted the focus to social and cultural mobilities. This article argues for the emergence of a transoceanic Arabic historiography during the sixteenth century, which reflected on the cultural integration of regions from Egypt, the Hijaz, and Yemen in the Red Sea region, to Gujarat, the Deccan, and Malabar in the subcontinent. Historians from the Persian cosmopolis further north observed a strong cultural connection between Arabophone communities of the western Indian Ocean region. Manuscript collections in India show that Arabic historical texts from the Red Sea region had a readership in the subcontinent. Most importantly, mobile scholars began to compose Arabic histories while receiving patronage at the western Indian courts. Scholarly mobilities fostered cultural exchanges, which increasingly built on a shared history, written, read, and circulated in Arabic during the sixteenth century","[{""name"": ""Christopher D.

Studies of race outside the global north have often been hobbled by rigid modernist assumptions that over-privilege the determining influence of Western discourses at the expense of local intellectual inheritances. This essay, in contrast, proposes a focus on locally inherited discourses of difference that have shown signs of becoming racialized, at times through entanglement with Western ideas. It pays particular attention to discourses that arranged “human kinds” along a progression from barbarian to civilized, suggesting the presence of African historicisms that in modern times have converged with the stadial ideas that played a major role in Western racial thought.","[{""name"": ""Jonathon Glassman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226289663.001.0001"", ""10.1353/arw.2005.0047"", ""10.1080/13504630600823585"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226773858.001.0001"", ""10.18772/22008114877""]",['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Due to their good compositional properties, history-deterministic automata are useful in solving games and synthesis problems. Deciding whether a given nondeterministic automaton is history-deterministic (the problem) is generally a difficult task, which might involve an exponential procedure, or even be undecidable, for example for pushdown automata.Token gamesprovide aPTimesolution to the problem of Büchi and coBüchi automata, and it is conjectured that 2-token games characterise for all$$\omega $$ω-regular automata. We extend token games to the quantitative setting and analyze their potential to help deciding for quantitative automata. In particular, we show that 1-token games characterise for all quantitative (and Boolean) automata on finite words, as well as discounted-sum ($${\mathsf {DSum}}$$DSum) automata on infinite words, and that 2-token games characterise of$${\mathsf {LimInf}}$$LimInfand$${\mathsf {LimSup}}$$LimSupautomata.

10.1017/S0018246X21000261,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,"Tobacco and the Social Life of Conquest in London, 1580-1625","AbstractFrom its origins in the Chesapeake and the Caribbean to its transformation into smoke in a Jacobean chamber, tobacco entered drastically new contexts of use as it travelled from Indigenous America to the social spaces of early seventeenth-century London. This article draws on comparative anthropology and archaeology to explore how early colonization, particularly in Jamestown, influenced the development of smoking among the English political elite. This offers a case study into the ways in which Indigenous commodities and knowledge were integrated into English ritual practices of their own; it also reveals the deliberate choices made by the English to set themselves apart from those they sought to colonize. Placing the material practices and wit poetry of gentlemen within the geopolitics of colonialism raises attention to the acts of erasure or dispossession that accompanied the incorporation of tobacco into urban sociability. Here, the practices of Indigenous peoples were modified and altered, and the pleasures of plantation were expressed as an intoxication as potent as the plant itself.","[{""name"": ""Lauren Working"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4159/9780674029439"", ""10.1353/jsh.0.0019"", ""10.1017/S0018246X16000595"", ""10.1111/ehr.12660"", ""10.1002/9781118241912"", ""10.1017/S0018246X11000197"", ""10.2307/j.ctvzpv6kq"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199645916.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511483844"", ""10.1179/174581306X156463"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195335545.001.0001"", ""10.1086/691831"", ""10.1086/ahr.111.3.660"", ""10.2307/3986264"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198217657.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230339675"", ""10.1017/9780511978814"", ""10.12745/et.20.2.2952""]","['Social Sciences', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Food Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Using spatial analysis, it shows how early forms of residential separation were driven by the desire of elites to create secluded residential neighbourhoods. Further, although stark contrasts delineated the extremes of wealth and poverty, the city's dominant landscape was defined by in-between conditions and subtle variations in built environment and residential distance.","[{""name"": ""Gergely Baics"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/009614429802400601"", ""10.1353/book.88356"", ""10.1080/02665433.2017.1397537"", ""10.1353/book13971"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691168791.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226317755.001.0001"", ""10.1215/01636545-1979-21-131"", ""10.1080/00130095.1966.11729845"", ""10.2307/143041"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674735989.c2"", ""10.7202/1015817ar"", ""10.1080/24694452.2016.1177442"", ""10.2307/214962"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00084"", ""10.1016/j.jhg.2007.06.003"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2009.05.001"", ""10.7591/9781501743627"", ""10.2307/1887866"", ""10.1006/jhge.2000.0267"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199344369.001.0001"", ""10.7202/1017591ar"", ""10.1515/9780773586000"", ""10.7312/columbia/9780231172165.001.0001"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674494213"", ""10.1016/0305-7488(79)90037-9"", ""10.1353/aq.1999.0057"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511975912"", ""10.1017/S0963926811000022"", ""10.2307/2137377"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226477046.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Environmental Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Finance']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"

However, commemorations are also used by national-populist political parties for electoral purposes and can lead to tensions with neighbouring states. This was the case in Trieste in September 2019, when the city council executive (controlled by a right-wing national-populist coalition) decided to erect a statue of Gabriele D'Annunzio, 100 years after he had occupied the nearby city of Fiume (now Rijeka) in Croatia. This commemoration led to a series of debates among historians, especially in Italy. Based on a critical discourse analysis and an interdiscursive approach to narratives produced by historians for colleagues and for the broader society, the current research investigates the use of cosmopolitanism in the field of history when in parallel a commemoration is coordinated by national-populist forces in a public space.","[{""name"": ""Christian Lamour"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/mit.2020.75,MODERN ITALY,0603 World History; 0705 Geography,The quality of wine between innovation and tradition. A study of a changing 'Mediterranean drinking culture',"Wine consumption is affected by intertwined needs generated by factors such as production and marketing methods, as well as by the individual's desire for social differentiation in a democratised mass drinking culture. Our study sought to determine whether consumption patterns have changed in the Italian province of Trentino and how such changes may have affected the meaning that wine drinkers living in this area assign to the concept of quality in wine. The paper presents a qualitative study (n=57 interviews) carried out in a wine producing region in north-east Italy. In addition to investigating the changes that have taken place in the area's wine drinking culture, the study also focuses on how consumers perceive and define wine quality. The findings show that economic, political and social factors have brought major changes in drinking culture and consumption over the last 50 years. In addition, changes in the wine industry have had a significant impact on how consumers’ views on wine quality and its key features have evolved. Nevertheless, the study found that some traditional aspects persist in the drinking culture and still determine the perception of quality.","[{""name"": ""Franca Beccaria"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Albertina Pretto"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780203013267"", ""10.1111/j.1530-0277.2007.00565.x"", ""10.3109/10826084.2014.925314"", ""10.1177/009145090703400202"", ""10.1080/13676261.2014.992321"", ""10.3280/SES2010-SU3003-ing"", ""10.1093/alcalc/agx048"", ""10.1177/0759106311417543"", ""10.2478/nsad-2014-0015"", ""10.1177/145507251002700504"", ""10.3280/SES2010-SU3015-ing"", ""10.1016/j.appet.2015.02.014"", ""10.25058/20112742.103"", ""10.1177/1469540514536192"", ""10.1016/j.foodqual.2003.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.drugpo.2014.10.008""]","['Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Plant Science', 'Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management', 'Food Science']","[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7261), ('0908 水产', 0.7005)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)]]"
10.1017/S1740022822000079,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY,0603 World History,"The league against imperialism, national liberation, and the economic question","AbstractThe League Against Imperialism (LAI) was an international organization active from 1927 to 1937 that brought together communists, socialists, nationalists, trade unionists, and pacifists in order to coordinate their myriad ‘assaults against empire’. Founded with the support of the Communist International, the LAI at its peak had a membership of several hundred people, from every inhabited continent, among them prominent interwar activists and future heads of state. The organization aspired both to become an international movement and to coordinate specific instances of mass struggle. Exploring both aspects shows how the LAI interwove the global and the local in interwar anti-imperialist movements. This article draws from recent work on interwar anti-imperialism and internationalism as well as work on struggles for economic sovereignty in the 1960s–70s to argue that a critical aspect of the LAI’s anti-imperial politics concerned the relationship between political independence and the world economy. Through an examination of LAI members’ writings and public addresses, we can observe this relationship through the staging of their own claims for self-rule and control over land, labour, and resources.","[{""name"": ""Disha Karnad Jani"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Analysis of the photographs presents female pedestrians as the most numerous and continuously large group on the urban streets and reveals gendered patterns and practices of walking. Furthermore, it showcases how female mobility patterns were ignored and harmed by the car-centred city planning and traffic solutions of the mid- and late twentieth century. At the same time, women's walking appears as a central enabler of the fragile technological system that is motorized urban transport.","[{""name"": ""Tiina Männistö-Funk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0011392114533211"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2011.12.002"", ""10.2307/2650573"", ""10.1111/j.0008-3658.2006.00124.x"", ""10.4135/9781412985833"", ""10.1080/14649365.2010.497913"", ""10.7312/scot91266"", ""10.1080/09663690903498225"", ""10.1108/JHRM-06-2014-0016"", ""10.4159/9780674495548"", ""10.2307/2902937"", ""10.1525/9780520915510"", ""10.1177/0098303983011004003"", ""10.1080/10486801.2012.666741"", ""10.1080/10253866.2015.1067617"", ""10.1017/S0007680500036722"", ""10.4324/9781315886572-31"", ""10.7591/9781501729232"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7423.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0042098014544760""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Geography, Planning and Development', 'Museology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

10.1017/jbr.2020.38,JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES,0603 World History,"The Scottish East India Company of 1617: Patronage, Commercial Rivalry, and the Union of the Crowns","AbstractThe history of the Scottish East India Company of 1617 is a history of partnerships and rivalries within and between Scotland and England. The company was opposed by the merchants of the royal burghs in Scotland and by the East India Company, Muscovy Company, and Privy Council in England. At the same time, it was supported by the Scottish Privy Council and was able to recruit Dutch, English, and Scottish investors. The interactions between these groups were largely shaped by the union of the crowns, which saw James VI accede to the thrones of England and Ireland and move his court to London. Scotland was thus left with an absentee monarch, decreasing the access of Scottish merchants to the king while increasing the importance of court connections in acquiring that access. Regal union also created opportunities for Scots to become part of the London business world, which, in turn, could lead to backlash from English interests. Having developed in this context, the Scottish East India Company speaks to how James VI and I approached patronage and policy in his multiple kingdoms, how commercial rivalries developed in England and Scotland, and how trading companies played a role in constitutional developments in Stuart Britain.","[{""name"": ""Joseph Wagner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511895982"", ""10.1163/9789047417002"", ""10.3366/jshs.2015.0138"", ""10.25071/2561-5467.735"", ""10.3366/jshs.2015.0152"", ""10.1163/9789004614611""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Shaping this new narrative are new museum projects devoted to Ukraine’s developing history. This article examines the process of these new institutions’ formation, the content of created exhibitions, and the activities conducted therein. It focuses on the role of the museums in activating, unifying, and integrating both the Ukrainian national community and civil society. This article is based on a qualitative analysis of materials collected during seven research stays in Ukraine, from June 2017 to August 2019, and focuses on four cases–Ukraine’s First ATO Museum in Dnipro; the Museum of the Heavenly Hundred in Ivano-Frankivsk; theUkrainian Eastexhibition in the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War in Kyiv; and a project of the Museum of the Revolution of Dignity in Kyiv. The examined institutions are presented not only as places for gathering artifacts but also as laboratories of civic activism, participation, and dialogue.","[{""name"": ""Elżbieta Olzacka"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctt1v2xskk"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492235"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1176994"", ""10.5771/9783845229553"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1451232"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1174980"", ""10.18523/kmhj73968.2016-3.197-214"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1452181"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1451241"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1159665"", ""10.1002/9780470996836.ch10"", ""10.4324/9781315737133"", ""10.1515/9786155211355"", ""10.1017/nps.2018.60"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198295341.001.0001""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

The supporters of the ban argued that the hijab was inimical to Azerbaijani culture and law because it violated the separation of religion and state, was a propaganda tool of Islamist fundamentalists funded from abroad, and was a foreign form of clothing that did not exist in Azerbaijani culture. This article examines why hijab is the focus of controversy in Azerbaijan. The supporters of the ban offered simple oppositions, such as secularism versus theocracy, modernity versus backwardness, and national versus foreign, to explain and justify the ban. However, these dichotomies do not capture the complexities of Islam in Azerbaijan. Rather, they are polemics that blur more than they reveal. In this article, I argue that the debates around the hijab controversy in Azerbaijan are a political discourse aimed at building a nation. The key contribution of this article is to examine the wider historical trajectory of the political discourse that constructed hijab as fundamentalist, backward, threatening, and alien, through discussing the topics of secularism, Islamist politics, modernity, and nationalism.","[{""name"": ""Galib Bashirov"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/1060586X.2017.1306950"", ""10.4324/9781315206721-5"", ""10.1080/17449855.2012.658244"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7sgmx"", ""10.4000/assr.18423"", ""10.1632/S0030812900105073"", ""10.4135/9781849208871"", ""10.1080/14690760008406923"", ""10.2307/4148592"", ""10.1080/00905992.2015.1082997"", ""10.1080/02634930410001310544"", ""10.1080/00905992.2016.1145200"", ""10.1080/00905999208408224"", ""10.7312/alts70456"", ""10.1177/0306396810377003"", ""10.1080/13530194.2016.1159541"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-10430-7"", ""10.1515/9781685856236-009"", ""10.1080/02634939808401028"", ""10.1177/1350506808095275"", ""10.1353/wp.2008.0005"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2017.05.002"", ""10.1215/07402775-2002-4009"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9655.2009.01546.x"", ""10.1080/02634937.2017.1418735"", ""10.1057/9780230376434"", ""10.1080/02634930802017895"", ""10.1080/09557571.2019.1624689"", ""10.1007/s11562-015-0340-4"", ""10.1080/02634930802018521"", ""10.1515/9783110536461"", ""10.4324/9781315629902""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

However, the analysis of the survey is a pretext to remind one of the limitations of crude quantitative methods and to look at the Polish national identity itself. The article shows that the survey questions are far from unambiguous, and respondents might attribute different meanings to them. The survey does not “measure” national identity existing in the world, rather it serves to maintain the hegemonic concept of Polishness. It diminishes the significance of Catholicism and the perceived biological dimension of Polishness. It ignores public sentiment linking Whiteness and Polishness, contributing to maintaining the dominant image of Polishness as free of racism. Under the guise of objective research, the survey is one of the elements sustaining the image of a relatively open and inclusive Polishness. Referring to my own qualitative research and recent literature on the topic, I argue that Polish identity must be seen in terms of selective racism without racism—that is, it is an identity based on racial premises but which at the same time neglects its racial character.","[{""name"": ""Krzysztof Jaskulowski"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-60036-9"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558764"", ""10.1086/204339"", ""10.1007/s10767-018-9287-9"", ""10.4135/9781529716665"", ""10.1111/1471-0374.00043"", ""10.1177/1077800419857093"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1djmhhh"", ""10.15171/ijhpm.2019.22"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1302093"", ""10.1177/1525822X05279903"", ""10.1023/A:1007068714468"", ""10.3390/socsci8110314"", ""10.1111/nana.12269"", ""10.2307/j.ctvqht03"", ""10.1057/pmed.2014.19"", ""10.4324/9781351135559-19"", ""10.18276/os.2017.3-05"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8330.1992.tb00448.x"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1392028"", ""10.2307/3086327"", ""10.1080/15562948.2017.1317897"", ""10.1093/0199240981.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01419870120112049"", ""10.1177/0197918319839947"", ""10.2753/IJS0020-7659390304""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Anthropology', 'Philosophy', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Thesemoral geographiesof “Greater India” are still current in universities, museums, textbooks, and popular culture across the world. This article explores, for the period from the 1890s to the 1960s, how networks of scholars, intellectuals, and art collectors linking Indonesia, mainland Asia, and the West helped shaping these moral geographies and enabled the inclusion of predominantly Islamic Indonesia. It contributes to recent debates on the role of religion and affections in Orientalism by following object-biographies and focusing on knowledge exchange via the networks they connected, and by exploring the possibilities, violence, and limits of cultural understanding as objects travel from their sites of origin to elsewhere in the world. The article conceptualizes moral geographies as a heuristic device to understand how people have imagined their belonging to atransnationalspace—in this case Greater India—whether they live inside or outside of that space. It examines the impact these moral geographies have on processes of inclusion and exclusion, particularly their common disregard for Indonesia's Islamic cultures. It warns against pitfalls of transnational, “Oceanic” approaches to Asian history that focus on cultural flows, as these can exaggerate the region's cultural unity and, in doing so, reify the moral geographies of Greater India that the article interrogates.","[{""name"": ""Marieke Bloembergen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/02690055.2012.663098"", ""10.1017/S0021911813001599"", ""10.1111/1469-8676.12100"", ""10.1017/S0026749X04001246"", ""10.1525/california/9780520244535.001.0001"", ""10.1163/22134379-90001559"", ""10.3406/arch.2009.4125"", ""10.1017/S0217781100000582"", ""10.2307/2055365"", ""10.1017/9781108632317"", ""10.1017/S0021911810002858"", ""10.2307/2058745"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226710907.001.0001"", ""10.7591/9781501732607"", ""10.7312/dero12788"", ""10.2307/3177288"", ""10.18352/bmgn-lchr.9444"", ""10.4159/9780674028579"", ""10.1215/1089201X-1891579"", ""10.2752/147800410X477368"", ""10.1093/ahr/123.3.846"", ""10.1163/22134379-90003772"", ""10.1111/j.1478-0542.2008.00545.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976346"", ""10.1355/9789814695091"", ""10.4324/9780203891308"", ""10.1515/9781474472685"", ""10.2307/3248466"", ""10.1525/9780520941052"", ""10.52476/trb.9791"", ""10.1017/S0021911817001292"", ""10.1017/S001041750400012X"", ""10.1355/9789814311175-003"", ""10.1017/9781108614757"", ""10.1080/14639947.2013.785248"", ""10.1080/19472498.2011.605297"", ""10.1017/S1740022809990362"", ""10.1111/muwo.12166"", ""10.1017/S0021911817000900"", ""10.1017/S0084255900007944"", ""10.1515/9781400844425"", ""10.1353/jhi.0.0054"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-13638-7_5"", ""10.1017/S0026749X15000451"", ""10.4000/books.editionscnrs.4880"", ""10.1057/9780230309005"", ""10.2307/3258591"", ""10.9783/9780812200058""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

I concretise this by studying Bengali Hindu refugees who migrated from Muslim-majority eastern Bengal (after the Partition of British India in 1947 part of Pakistan, and after 1971, the sovereign state of Bangladesh) to the Hindu-majority Indian state of West Bengal, and occasionally their descendants as well. By studying the transnational horizons of Bengali refugees from the late 1940s to today, I posit them as part of modern global intellectual history. Bengali refugees and their descendants connected their experiences with those of refugees elsewhere in the world, seeing themselves, for example, as “new Jews.” Later, some of them aligned themselves with the Palestinian cause. Refugee politics became enmeshed with Cold War revolutionary currents. European, Soviet, and Chinese Marxist theory—and latent Lockean assumptions—propelled the everyday politics of refugee land occupation. Marxism, sometimes with Hegelian inflection, nourished the East Bengali-–origin founders of Subaltern Studies theory and Dalit (lower-caste) thought. Ultimately, this essay shows how Bengali refugees instrumentalised transnational thinking to produce new models of democratic political thought and practice in postcolonial India. I describe this as “refugee democracy.”","[{""name"": ""Milinda Banerjee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/intejethi.30.3.2377667"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00017133"", ""10.1093/pastj/gts034"", ""10.1163/15685209-12341471"", ""10.1163/9789004303799"", ""10.2307/2658391"", ""10.1017/S1479244318000215""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Philosophy', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Exploring the local socio-political context in which these (neo)-fascists moved, and the networks that they formed, the study delves into the creation of ratlines crucial for fascists to escape from the Allied prosecution once the Second World War was over, the consolidation of the city as a central meeting point for fascists from all over the world (from Degrelle to Skorzeny, passing by Horia Sima or Filippo Anfuso), discussions around the possible creation of paramilitary organisations, and the everyday lives of (neo)-fascists operating in Madrid. On the basis of police reports, secret service intelligences and other primary sources, this paper foregrounds the role of the fascist diaspora and the subsequent interactions as driving forces enabling entanglements, and cooperation among (neo)-fascist movements and the Francoist regime, at various formal or informal political levels.","[{""name"": ""Pablo del Hierro"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0022009404046752"", ""10.1017/S0960777311000488"", ""10.1017/9781108182423"", ""10.1163/187633010X541786"", ""10.4324/9780429058356-12"", ""10.1080/1354571X.2016.1207317"", ""10.1080/713682938"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198208723.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230113046"", ""10.7829/j.ctv4cbhsr"", ""10.2307/j.ctvw04hnr"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139344449"", ""10.7788/boehlau.9783412334529"", ""10.1017/9781108628587"", ""10.1057/9781137448682"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139344449"", ""10.1017/S0960777300000904"", ""10.1080/003132299128810687"", ""10.1177/002200948101600201"", ""10.1080/21567689.2013.849588"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2011.605842"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206453.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Defining automation broadly as artificial intelligence and “other digital technologies,” the company promised in its reports that it could advise companies how they might prepare. Amidst this flurry of publication, McKinsey produced several articles specifically on the theme of “The Future of Work in Black America.” With “a new and proprietary data set”—a data set so proprietary readers were not privileged to see it—McKinsey claimed that “automation” would hurt the job prospects of Black Americans, and in particular Black men, more deeply and more broadly than any other demographic group in the United States. The jobs Black people held, McKinsey seemed to believe, were precisely those best performed by robots. For McKinsey's analysts, this conclusion was all but obvious when one considered, first, the racist exclusion of Black Americans from the resources of society, and second, the levels of education required to obtain the jobs Black people in America disproportionately hold, like “truck drivers, food service workers, and office clerks.”","[{""name"": ""Jason Resnikoff"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/book66006"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226692852.001.0001"", ""10.5622/illinois/9780252044250.001.0001"", ""10.1525/california/9780520285378.001.0001"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9780807835203.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9798400682735"", ""10.1215/15476715-9361751""]",['Computer Science'],['Computer Science Applications'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Using data from Texas, we show that former slave owners made up more than half of all state legislators until the late 1890s. Legislators with slave-owning backgrounds were more likely to be Democrats and voted more conservatively even conditional on party membership. A county’s propensity to elect former slave owners was positively correlated with cotton production, but negatively with Reconstruction-era progress of blacks. Counties that elected more slave owners also displayed worse educational outcomes for blacks in the early twentieth century.","[{""name"": ""Luna Bellani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anselm Hager"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephan E.

By using the novel framework of coffee, from the bean in the field to the machine in the caffè, it connects interwar histories that previously have been explored independently. Specifically, it examines the transnational economics of coffee bean trade routes and the colonial imagery of coffee advertising to argue that caffès emerged as key sites for promoting the Fascist imperial projects in East Africa – an architectural and artistic legacy that remains in place today. Ultimately, this trajectory broadens the way that we understand how food and farming became politicised during the Fascist period. By untangling the interwar trade of beans and bodies between Italy, Brazil, and Ethiopia, this article brings to light an untold story of caffeinated imperial aggression and resistance.","[{""name"": ""Diana Garvin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9781137569622"", ""10.1215/9780822388029"", ""10.1086/449039"", ""10.2979/reseafrilite.43.2.155"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226803487.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S174002280600012X""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Its hypothesis may be simply stated in the following terms: key political theorists and administrators in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century France defined democracy as a means for solving public problems by the public itself. This conception of democracy focused on inventing effective practices of government, administrative intervention and regulatory police and differed fundamentally from our contemporary understandings that privilege the vote, popular sovereignty and parliamentary representation. Moreover, this conception of modern democracy overlapped and in some cases complemented, but—more importantly for this article—remained in significant ways distinct from, other early modern political traditions, in particular liberalism and classical republicanism. What follows therefore uncovers a largely forgotten, but widespread, conception of democracy in the crucial revolutionary age from the mid-eighteenth century to the mid-nineteenth by asking the question, was there a modern democratic tradition?","[{""name"": ""Stephen W.

10.1017/S0018246X22000309,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,The Economic Crisis of the 1690s in England,"AbstractBeginning in 1689, England was struck by not one but three economic shocks. First, the war against France – Europe's greatest military power – attracted swarms of hostile warships and privateers that heavily damaged English maritime trade, while military expenses also led to a doubling of the tax burden. Second, wartime conditions and government mismanagement sparked a currency crisis in 1695–7 that halted much domestic commerce and caused a run on the recently founded Bank of England. Third, William III's reign brought rapid inflation in the cost of the necessities of life, especially food and fuel, which resulted in prolonged widespread hunger from 1693 onwards. Yet, these hardships have rarely received more than a passing mention in political histories of the Glorious Revolution and do not fit easily into the narratives of economic expansion in the later Stuart period. Close analysis of these ‘hard times’ demonstrates the limits of histories that emphasize long-term developments over short-term crises. Using evidence from a wide range of local and national archives, this article shows the impact of these shocks on the lives of ordinary people.","[{""name"": ""Brodie Waddell"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/1468-0289.00167"", ""10.1017/S002205070009865X"", ""10.1093/past/170.1.78"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511560453"", ""10.1093/ehr/cew236"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00415.x"", ""10.1017/S0022050715000662"", ""10.1093/ehr/cev043"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511933905"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtaa027"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-07303-7""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

It compares Soviet policies in the southern and northern “halves” of the Aral Sea region. While the Kazaks in the northern part of the region suffered from the famine, the Karakalpaks in the south did not. The article explains this difference by underscoring the role of the main transportation infrastructure connecting Central Asia to Russia, the Orenburg-Tashkent railway. The railway crossed the northern, Kazak, part of the Aral Sea region and made massive livestock and grain procurements possible, while the absence of any reliable transportation route connecting Karakalpakstan to Soviet industrial centers contributed to shielding the Karakalpaks from the famine. The article also investigates the consequences of the famine for the Aral Sea fishing economy. The famine led to the inversion of the relative economic importance of the northern and southern parts of the sea: if before the famine fishing was concentrated in the former, after the famine it had shifted to the latter. Finally, the article situates the administrative detachment of Karakalpakstan from Kazakstan in 1930 within the context of Stalinist economic policies in Central Asia.","[{""name"": ""Niccolò Pianciola"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/russ.12141"", ""10.1163/9789004473782_006"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801454097.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv7r41ms.11"", ""10.14220/9783737007863"", ""10.1163/24685623-12340016"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1vw0r3p.14"", ""10.1057/9780230502840"", ""10.2307/j.ctv3znxgm"", ""10.1080/02634937.2016.1221380""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Answering this question requires a comparative focus on the courts of mixed commission that adjudicated naval captures of slave ships, located at Sierra Leone (the foremost site of British abolition) and Brazil (the primary mid-century target). Court jurisdiction conflicted with sovereign jurisdiction regarding the presence of recaptives (“liberated Africans”), the risk of re-enslavement, and unlawful naval captures. To rescue the re-enslaved and compensate the loss of property, regulating anti-slave-trade jurisdiction involved coercive strategies alternating with negotiated value exchanges. Abolition as a legal field emerged from interactions between liberated Africans, British diplomatic and naval agents, and local political elites in Brazil and on the Upper Guinea Coast.","[{""name"": ""Jake Subryan Richards"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0021853700034782"", ""10.1215/00182168-53.1.50"", ""10.2307/1158128"", ""10.1080/0144039X.2011.588468"", ""10.1163/15718050-12340074"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628283.008"", ""10.2307/1157659"", ""10.1353/book.597"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139014946"", ""10.1017/ajil.2019.23"", ""10.1086/ahr.117.1.40"", ""10.1525/california/9780520076037.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1159908"", ""10.1017/S0021853700005612"", ""10.1080/0144039X.2011.588480"", ""10.2307/1409963"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780195391626.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674972780-005"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070117"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-95013-3_2"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801451089.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511759734"", ""10.1353/jwh.2018.0000"", ""10.1017/S0021853714000371""]",['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Scott, the New York Times film critics, published an article entitled “The Century's Greatest Actors,” in which they proclaimed, “We are in a golden age of acting—make that platinum.” Celebrating the fact that their list of the top twenty-five actors from the last twenty years “looked beyond Hollywood,” Dargis and Scott declared that while there are Oscar winners on their list, “there are also character actors and chameleons.” One of the “radical shape-shifting” actors on the list is Tilda Swinton, whom Dargis characterized in the following fashion: The woman of a thousand otherworldly faces, Tilda Swinton has created enough personas—with untold wigs, costumes and accents—to have become a roster of one. She's a star, a character actor, a performance artist, an extraterrestrial, a trickster. Her pale, sharply planed face is an ideal canvas for paint and prosthetics, and capable of unnerving stillness. I am interested in the way that Swinton's “pale, sharply planed face” is praised for being so malleable: as Dargis says, “an ideal canvas for paint and prosthetics.” Swinton's paleness—her whiteness—is appended to her ability to be a “trickster,” to sustain paints and prosthetics, and to radically shape-shift. Swinton's acting craft is rendered visible to Dargis, because her “canvas” is “pale.”","[{""name"": ""Ayanna Thompson"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

10.1017/S0018246X1800047X,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,"THE SOCIAL, PERSONAL, AND SPIRITUAL DYNAMICS OF GHOST STORIES IN EARLY MODERN ENGLAND","AbstractIn early modern England, spectral figures were regular visitors to the world of the living and a vibrant variety of beliefs and expectations clustered around these questionable shapes. Yet whilst historians have established the importance of ghosts as cultural resources that were used to articulate a range of contemporary concerns about worldly life, we know less about the social and personal dynamics that underpinned the telling, recording, and circulation of ghost stories at the time. This article therefore focuses on a unique set of manuscript sources relating to apparitions in late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England to uncover a different vantage point. Drawing on the life-writing and correspondence of the antiquarian who collected the narratives, it lays bare concerns about familial relations and gender that ghost stories were bound up with. Tracing the way that belief in ghosts functioned at an individual level also allows the recovery of the personal religious sensibilities and spiritual imperatives that sustained and nourished continuing belief in ghosts. This subjective angle demonstrates that ghost stories were closely intertwined with processes of grieving and remembering the dead, and they continued to be associated with theological understandings of the afterlife and the fate of the soul.","[{""name"": ""LAURA SANGHA"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/1468-0424.00262"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2281.2005.00226.x"", ""10.1057/9780230273948"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199273713.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0018246X12000076"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226148847.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ehr/XXXVII.CXLVII.413"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199255986.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199565726.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198201847.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0022046998006307"", ""10.1080/00155870500479851""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['History', 'Religious studies', 'Classics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6825), ('0602 中国史', 0.6817)]]"
10.1017/S1053837220000048,JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF ECONOMIC THOUGHT,0603 World History,THE PLEASURE OF EXCHANGE: ADAM SMITH'S THIRD KIND OF SELF-LOVE,"This article argues that the self-love that motivates exchange in The Wealth of Nations (WN) can be seen as the desire for deserved approval discussed by Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (TMS). This often overlooked desire appears in TMS as the most representative kind of self-love. Exchange motivated by this desire emerges as the way to find confirmation through others’ appraisal of one’s own self-assessment, and thus to find an agreed-upon measure for respective deserved praise. The target in this economic relationship is that equivalence that signals mutual recognition of deserved esteem. Equivalence here is the aim and not the result of exchange, unlike a tug-of-war, where both parties try to give as little and gain as much as possible regardless of the recognition each deserves.","[{""name"": ""Michele Bee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09608788.2016.1146654"", ""10.1215/00182702-3-2-265"", ""10.1080/096725600361843"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300162530.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09672560050192125"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226556673.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400826636"", ""10.1007/978-1-4757-3470-6_2"", ""10.4337/9781782542377.00015"", ""10.1080/01916599.2019.1574488"", ""10.1080/09672567.2013.824997"", ""10.1086/466895"", ""10.1017/S026626710000451X"", ""10.1080/09672567.2018.1449876"", ""10.4324/9781315436579"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628276"", ""10.1080/09672561003715256"", ""10.1016/0144-8188(81)90013-2"", ""10.1017/S1479244312000042"", ""10.1215/00182702-2008-006"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511676352"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199213337.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199674176.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2708748"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474422857.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400868865"", ""10.5840/beq201222222"", ""10.1353/nlh.1997.0049"", ""10.1093/cje/bex008"", ""10.1108/eb014000"", ""10.1515/9781400822942"", ""10.1017/S0266267100001395"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492341"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490538"", ""10.1080/0967256032000171489"", ""10.1057/9780230508279_3"", ""10.1515/9781474422864-009"", ""10.1515/9781400848515"", ""10.1215/00182702-18-3-365"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521770599.007"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558665"", ""10.1215/00182702-27-4-755"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511584749"", ""10.1017/S000842390000010X"", ""10.1093/oseo/instance.00042845"", ""10.4324/9780203488119"", ""10.1525/9780520908482-020"", ""10.3917/cep.048.0051"", ""10.1080/09538259.2011.583837"", ""10.1215/00182702-30-3-489"", ""10.3917/reco.652.0419"", ""10.1057/9780230355545"", ""10.1017/S0266267100001243"", ""10.3917/rpec.202.0003"", ""10.1080/09672560903204924"", ""10.1017/S0034670500030953"", ""10.1215/00182702-2010-019"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521770599.010"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-0905-9_2"", ""10.1017/S0266267100004508"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511581212""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Philosophy', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Unfortunately, modern DNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to a variety of attacks and buggy behavior. This has motivated recent work in formally analyzing the properties of such DNNs. This paper introduces SyReNN, a tool for understanding and analyzing a DNN by computing its symbolic representation. The key insight is to decompose the DNN into linear functions. Our tool is designed for analyses using low-dimensional subsets of the input space, a unique design point in the space of DNN analysis tools. We describe the tool and the underlying theory, then evaluate its use and performance on three case studies: computing Integrated Gradients, visualizing a DNN’s decision boundaries, and patching a DNN.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Sotoudeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aditya V.

Yet Afghan state leaders embraced the language of anti-colonialism and self-determination to assert influence in the international community, and especially at the UN. This paper explores the interactions between Afghan elites and the UN, particularly the way that Afghanistan fought the growing global consensus that self-determination in the era of decolonization meant the establishment of an international states system. Afghan elites instead argued that self-determination was for peoples, not states. Afghanistan’s stance on self-determination, as an exception to territorial state centrism, provides a way of thinking about decolonization’s universalisms and particularities, as well as how it ultimately complicated Afghanistan’s own place in the international community. The article uses Afghanistan’s engagement with the UN General Assembly and its various subcommittees, from its membership in 1946 to the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, to reflect on the ways decolonization became a global yet fractured phenomenon that came to mean numerous practices and could be used by different historical actors to articulate multiple, potentially competing visions of political autonomy and rights. International institutions like the UN provided crucial arenas where postcolonial statehood became the norm yet was nevertheless contested and questioned. By providing an exception to the UN’s focus on territorial statehood, Afghanistan demonstrates the ongoing fluidity and complexity of decolonization’s meaning and consequences, as well as the ways in which nations continue to inform the global.","[{""name"": ""Elisabeth Leake"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Colonial authorities established reservations as special zones to house colonial officials and other white Westerners. The article shows that the Ikoyi reservation was a significant location where a wide range of actors contested relationships between statehood and race. These renegotiations contributed to making a late colonial state, a terminal form of colonial state in which explicitly racialised discourses of statehood and urban space were challenged while implicitly racialised standards and practices often persisted. Through a focus on Ikoyi, the article highlights the important relationships between segregationist projects and late colonial statehood.","[{""name"": ""Tim Livsey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0021934706288447"", ""10.3406/cea.1980.2330"", ""10.4324/9780203964866"", ""10.2307/1858136"", ""10.2307/1860958"", ""10.4000/books.ifra.814"", ""10.2307/j.ctt2204p6x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226580777.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Urban Studies', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Accumulation in Maoist China was faster than even in Stalin's Soviet Union, despite the fact that China was a much poorer country with fewer natural resources. China's accumulation rate, defined as the ratio of gross capital formation to gross national income, reached twenty-five to thirty per cent in 1957–1962, peaking at forty-four per cent in 1958. This level proved to be unsustainable, but after a slowdown in the early 1960s, the rate rose back to thirty-six percent.1 As is well known, the cost of China's rapid industrialization was borne mostly by its rural population.2 My aim in this chapter is to show that it was disproportionally borne by rural women, who contributed to socialist accumulation in direct and indirect ways: directly, as collective farmers, growers of the grain, cotton, soy, tea, sugarcane, etc. that fueled industrialization; and indirectly, by biologically, socially, and materially reproducing the country's labor force and by submitting to a regime of extreme austerity that allowed the government to extract scarce resources and direct them to the cities and the export trade. My argument proceeds in three steps. I will begin with an overview of socialist primitive accumulation under Mao, its preconditions and mechanisms, and the ways it replicated earlier Soviet policies or diverged from them. Next, I will discuss the various ways in which rural women's work underpinned capital accumulation and laid the foundation for China's rapid industrialization in the years since Mao's death. Finally, I will look in some detail at rural women's work at home, to show how their self-exploitation, overwork, and underconsumption in the domestic realm created the conditions for accumulation. My focus is on cotton work – both cotton cultivation and domestic cloth production – but I will also look at other ways in which domestic work supported accumulation.","[{""name"": ""Jacob Eyferth"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/20066067"", ""10.1177/009770048300900404"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.oep.a042156"", ""10.1017/S0020859012000521"", ""10.1525/9780520913196"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195078725.001.0001"", ""10.7312/eise18666""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

It sheds new light on an example of innovative urban design and post-disaster reconstruction, and highlights the growing place that children occupied in the minds of bureaucrats and urban planners. The small parks were designed for children first and foremost. Originally conceived as a means to increase space for school children to play and exercise, all 52 parks were strategically located beside primary schools. As the state's goals of social management expanded, however, officials increasingly recognized the potential to use small parks as sites of rest and guided recreation, as well as emergency refuge. A history of Tokyo's small parks thus offers a window in to the growing understanding about the relationship between the built environment, health and society in inter-war Japan.","[{""name"": ""Janet Borland"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0026749X06001934"", ""10.1525/9780520954243"", ""10.1177/0096144209347737"", ""10.4324/9780203993927"", ""10.1080/10371397.2016.1246058"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1tfj9x7"", ""10.1016/j.jhg.2003.10.001"", ""10.1017/S0963926801000347"", ""10.1525/9780520932203"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5469.001.0001"", ""10.56021/9780801837586"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1x07xhf.8"", ""10.2307/jj.9992404""]",['Environmental Science'],['Nature and Landscape Conservation'],"[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)]]"

According to this, military and diplomatic factors reduced the inflow of slaves from the seventeenth century onwards and, consequently, exorbitant prices turned slaveholding into a luxury inaccessible to all but the top elite. Using evidence from probate inventories of the city of Bursa and its hinterland from 1460 to 1880, the present study examines this narrative in light of the incidence of slave-ownership and prices. We observe substantial decline in slaveholding already before the beginning of the government reforms concerning slavery and slave trade in the nineteenth century. We also find a decline in slave prices, both absolute and relative to wages. This is unexpected. Further analysis suggests, on the one hand, that a different supply factor, relative increase in the African slave population due to changes in the global traffic may have been instrumental in these trends, which links Bursa's non-colonial market to world slavery. On the other hand, examination of the consumption/investment preferences of the wealthy suggests that demand for slaves, too, may have declined, we surmise, in response to demographic and social change affecting alternative labor costs as well as cultural change affecting the meaning of slaveholding.","[{""name"": ""Hülya Canbakal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alpay Filiztekin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/9789047400370_005"", ""10.1086/ahr.111.5.1352"", ""10.4324/9780203011256"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139014946"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300163872.003.0004"", ""10.1017/S0010417517000226"", ""10.3167/9781785339110"", ""10.2143/TURC.17.0.2014294"", ""10.2307/1571461"", ""10.1080/09518969608569713"", ""10.1080/01440398808574962"", ""10.1163/18775462X00302005"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198785415.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9780804783750"", ""10.1057/9780230372979"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195076738.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1571460"", ""10.1017/S0021853700007945"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2005.09.001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6443.2008.00347.x"", ""10.4324/9781315580777"", ""10.1080/03066150802151041"", ""10.1163/156852087X00143"", ""10.1080/01440398008574806"", ""10.1017/S0020743800026295"", ""10.1080/01440390802267774"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521840682"", ""10.1017/S0022050700085223"", ""10.4324/9780203962817"", ""10.1163/9789004236455"", ""10.1017/S0022050702000517"", ""10.2307/j.ctvx0729p"", ""10.2307/1773282""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/tam.2020.2,AMERICAS,0603 World History,"Shantytown Mexico: The Democratic Opening in Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl, 1969-1976","The article analyzes political conflict in Mexico through a powerful social movement that erupted in the massive shantytown of Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl between 1969 and 1973. In the summer of 1969, after decades of abysmal living conditions, the residents of Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl (Neza) launched a payment strike to demand the federal government expropriate the land from private land developers, with the intent to gain urban infrastructure and formal property titles. The rebellion that plunged Ciudad Neza into a state of perpetual strife reflects a juncture in Mexican history when the urban shantytown emerged as a distinct and influential site for mass politics. This article historicizes Mexico's urban shantytown as a political space where the ruling party's entrenched clientelism contended with embryonic forms of local democracy. Revealing numerous contradictions, this case study is emblematic of how the urban periphery was a precursor to the vibrant yet incomplete democratization that would come to define national politics in Mexico and much of Latin America in the 1980s.","[{""name"": ""David Yee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1548-744X.2009.01024.x"", ""10.1017/tam.2015.67"", ""10.1017/S002387910001534X"", ""10.2307/3539640"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11317qw"", ""10.1215/9780822376835"", ""10.1215/9780822372097"", ""10.1215/9780822377498"", ""10.2307/j.ctv3f8qq2.10""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The prior encodes uncertainty about the actual transition rates, while the parameters allow dependencies between transition rates. Sampling the parameter values from the prior distribution then yields a standard CTMC, for which we may compute relevant reachability probabilities. We provide a principled solution, based on a technique called scenario-optimization, to the following problem: From a finite set of parameter samples and a user-specified confidence level, compute prediction regions on the reachability probabilities. The prediction regions should (with high probability) contain the reachability probabilities of a CTMC induced by any additional sample. To boost the scalability of the approach, we employ standard abstraction techniques and adapt our methodology to support approximate reachability probabilities. Experiments with various well-known benchmarks show the applicability of the approach.","[{""name"": ""Thom S.

10.1017/S0018246X20000527,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,"STATE AND CORPORATION IN AMERICAN POPULIST POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, 1877-1902","AbstractThis article examines the political theory of the late nineteenth-century American Populist movement, with a particular focus on its theories of state and corporation. Recent scholarship on populism has tended to present the phenomenon as a variant of direct democracy intrinsically opposed to intermediary bodies, a feature consistently traced back to American Populism as well. In this account, American Populists opposed new discourses of corporate personhood and free incorporation in the late nineteenth century owing to their tendency to distort natural bonds between peoples and leaders and to disperse the popular will. This article questions the tenability of this opposition through a close contextual engagement with original Populist texts. As the first self-declared ‘populist’ movement in modern history, Populists theorized about the usage of corporate personality for their own co-operatives and put forward ambitious visions of American statecraft, breaking with the proprietary individualism that characterized Jeffersonian agrarianism before. The article focuses on two particular genres of Populist thinking: first, their advocacy of the corporate form for their co-operative farm organizing and, secondly, a specifically statutory vision of state reform. It concludes with reflections on how these findings destabilize assumptions governing the current populism debate in political theory and American historiography.","[{""name"": ""ANTON JÄGER"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.56021/9780801846564"", ""10.1080/01615440903277062"", ""10.1093/ahr/122.1.55"", ""10.7591/9781501709739"", ""10.1017/S0898030600004516"", ""10.4159/9780674042827"", ""10.2307/3070242"", ""10.2307/3640174"", ""10.1017/S0898588X13000163"", ""10.1353/book11465"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807725"", ""10.1215/01903659-2007-013"", ""10.4159/9780674977686"", ""10.4159/9780674973879"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816674268.001.0001"", ""10.1353/rah.0.0003"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674726383"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226480473.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1893427"", ""10.1353/book.72113"", ""10.1353/book.458"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511528781"", ""10.2307/1892435""]","['Social Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

As such, it is often argued that the conflict was shaped predominantly by the divergent theological attitudes between the rites-supporting Jesuits and their anti-rites opponents towards “accommodation.” By examining the Jesuit missionary Kilian Stumpf'sActa Pekinensia—a detailed chronicle of the papal legate Charles-Thomas Maillard de Tournon's 1705–6 investigation into the controversy in Beijing—this article proposes that ostensibly religious disputes between Catholic orders consisted primarily of disagreements over ancient Chinese history. Stumpf's text shows that missionaries’ understandings of antiquity were constructed through their interpretations of ancient Chinese books and their interactions with the Kangxi Emperor. The article suggests that the historiographical characterization of the controversy as “religious” has its roots in the Vatican suppression of the rites, which served to erase the historical nature of the conflict exposed in theActa Pekinensia.","[{""name"": ""Gianamar Giovannetti-Singh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0424208400002576"", ""10.1353/book.66175"", ""10.1057/9780230625310"", ""10.1163/15700682-12341338"", ""10.1163/26669323-04601004"", ""10.1353/jwh.2019.0061"", ""10.1017/mah.2019.26"", ""10.1515/9780804779432"", ""10.1163/26669323-03501003"", ""10.1353/srm.2019.0011"", ""10.3406/arasi.2001.1465"", ""10.1017/9781108379793"", ""10.1515/9780824845988"", ""10.2307/1858704""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

Even less well understood are the ways in which those who were tainted by complicity reframed their personal life stories. Millions had been willing facilitators, witting beneficiaries, or passive (and perhaps unhappily helpless) witnesses of Nazi persecution; many had been actively involved in sustaining Nazi rule; perhaps a quarter of a million had personally killed Jewish civilians, and several million had direct knowledge of genocide. How did these people re-envision their own lives after Nazism? And how did they reinterpret their own former behaviors—their actions and inaction—in light of public confrontations with Nazi crimes and constructions of “perpetrators” in trials? Going beyond well-trodden debates about “overcoming the past,” this paper explores patterns of personal memory among East and West Germans after Nazism.","[{""name"": ""Mary Fulbrook"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3167/9781789200935""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Drawing on archival, ethnographic, and historical sources, I show that this law belongs to a political genealogy of philosephardism in which the “return” of Sephardi Jews has been imagined as a way to usher in a deferred Spanish modernity. Borrowing from anthropological theories of “racial fusion,” philosephardic thinkers at the turn of the twentieth century saw Sephardi Jews as inheritors of a racial mixture that made them living repositories of an earlier moment of national greatness. The senator Ángel Pulido, trained as an anthropologist, channeled these intellectual currents into an international campaign advocating the repatriation of Sephardi Jews. Linking this racial logic to an affective one, Pulido asserted that Sephardi Jews did not “harbor rancor” for the Expulsion, but instead felt love and nostalgia toward Spain, and could thus be trusted as loyal subjects who would help resurrect its empire. Today, affective criteria continue to be enmeshed in debates about who qualifies for inclusion and are inextricable from the histories of racial thought that made earlier exclusions possible. Like its precursors, the 2015 Sephardic citizenship law rhetorically fashioned Sephardi Jews as fundamentally Spanish, not only making claimsaboutSephardi Jews, but also making claimsonthem. Reckoning with how rancor and other sentiments have helped buttress such claims exposes the recalcitrant hold that philosephardic thought has on Spain's present, even those “progressive” political projects that promise to “return” what has been lost.","[{""name"": ""Charles A.

At a historical and political moment when Black Americans faced a violently repressive backlash against what progress they had achieved during Reconstruction, the successful passage and implementation of this legislation was unlikely. How did congressional lawmakers successfully pass the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1890, and was the expansion of educational opportunity for African Americans a clearly expressed objective? Using historical analysis of primary sources, this analysis suggests that the 1890 legislation’s investment in Black colleges reflected a politically expedient compromise between northern Radical Republicans who supported greater educational access for Black citizens and Southern Democrats who wished to expand higher educational opportunity in their region while also maintaining the segregated racial order of southern educational institutions.","[{""name"": ""DEONDRA ROSE"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2294350"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226845272.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2955088"", ""10.2307/2294350"", ""10.1207/S15327930PJE7601_03"", ""10.2307/2294350"", ""10.1353/ala.2010.0019"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195387421.001.0001"", ""10.1353/ala.2010.0019"", ""10.5406/jillistathistsoc.110.3-4.0305"", ""10.5149/uncp/9780807842218"", ""10.1017/S0898588X1600002X"", ""10.2307/2294350"", ""10.1353/ala.2013.0003"", ""10.2307/2950710"", ""10.1353/ala.2013.0003"", ""10.1353/rhe.2002.0007""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

RINO combines a zonotopic set representation with generalized mean-value AE extensions to compute under and over-approximations of the robust range of differentiable functions, and applies these techniques to the particular case of learning-enabled dynamical systems. The AE extensions require an efficient and accurate evaluation of the function and its Jacobian with respect to the inputs and initial conditions. For continuous-time systems, possibly controlled by neural networks, the function to evaluate is the solution of the dynamical system.

We demonstrate the good performances of RINO compared to state-of-the art tools Verisig 2.0 and ReachNN* on a set of classical benchmark examples of neural network controlled closed loop systems. For generally comparable precision to Verisig 2.0 and higher precision than ReachNN*, RINO is always at least one order of magnitude faster, while also computing the more involved inner-approximations that the other tools do not compute.","[{""name"": ""Eric Goubault"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sylvie Putot"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/2461328.2461358"", ""10.1109/RTSS.2012.70"", ""10.1145/3302504.3311807"", ""10.1145/3302504.3313351"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_30"", ""10.1109/LCSYS.2020.2997261"", ""10.1145/3302504.3311794"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2021.08.504"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96142-2_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-19992-9_27"", ""10.1145/3358228"", ""10.1145/3302504.3311806"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_11"", ""10.29007/9xgv"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24743-2_30"", ""10.1145/1141885.1141893"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-71493-4_34"", ""10.1609/aaai.v36i7.20790"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30942-8_39"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_1"", ""10.1145/3447928.3456643""]","['Computer Science', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

In this article we analyse the extant Old Hispanic processional antiphons, focusing on: the presence or absence of verses; amount of text and relationship with the Bible; cadence placement; number of notes per chant (melodic density) and per syllable; and melodic repetition within and between chants. We demonstrate that the processional antiphons are neither a homogenous corpus nor clearly differentiated stylistically from other Old Hispanic antiphons. In a short case study of the Good Friday Veneration of the Cross, we situate the processional antiphons within their wider ritual context, including their likely staging in the ecclesiastical architecture. As we show, the interaction between melody and ritual directed the antiphon texts towards a particular devotional end.","[{""name"": ""EMMA HORNBY"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""DAVID ANDRÉS FERNÁNDEZ"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""CARMEN JULIA GUTIÉRREZ"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""DIANNE SCULLIN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9781782040903"", ""10.1163/9789047416180_005"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190071530.001.0001"", ""10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.100566""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'General Arts and Humanities']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7038), ('1301 艺术学', 0.7023)]]"

It situates this focus amidst current methodological trends that stress structural oppression and argues that law-enforcers’ agency could illuminate discussions among historians and other scholars about the relationship between formal and informal law alongside the rise of the modern criminological state. The historical importance of enforcers is accentuated in the story told in each section—the shifting demographics of enforcement during Reconstruction; the inequalities of policing alongside lynching in the last decades of the nineteenth century; the complex interplay between policing and segregation statutes, colorblind criminal law, and mob violence in the Jim Crow South; the concurrent modernization of racialized policing nationwide; and the displacement of informal mob law and formal racial caste by a national regime of extralegal police violence, unequal patterns of incarceration and execution, and federal protections of civil liberties and civil rights.","[{""name"": ""Anthony Gregory"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00947679.2008.12062755"", ""10.2307/2079698"", ""10.1080/14664650500381058"", ""10.2307/27650230"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6563.1987.tb01914.x"", ""10.1353/cwe.2017.0038""]","['Social Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

This article seeks to enhance understanding of China’s defensive engagement with global health agencies, and more broadly of the relationship between pandemics and soft power, through an analysis of Uganda’s evolving response to HIV/AIDS. As with COVID-19, HIV/AIDS presented a fundamental threat not only to countries’ internal social stability and population health, but also to governmental legitimacy and nation-states’ international reputation. HIV, however, also provided Uganda with an opportunity to enhance its global standing, influence international policy, and achieve national reconstruction. This case study highlights the importance of viewing international affairs from the perspective of the Global South. It argues that the very weakness of Uganda, and the structural marginality of HIV/AIDS, provided the leverage which would in the end deliver radical shifts within global health.","[{""name"": ""Shane Doyle"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Development', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

In a context of competition with the former colonial powers and the USSR, the United States decided to set up scholarship programs for the training of postcolonial African elites. Through the analysis of one of these programs, the African Scholarship Program of American Universities (ASPAU), this article will show that in addition to the Cold War motivations of the US government, pan-African connections and university initiatives were essential in laying the groundwork for the project of educating Africans in the United States. It also highlights the too often overlooked role played by African leaders and academics in the concrete realization, reappropriation, and questioning of overseas training projects.","[{""name"": ""Anton Tarradellas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00309230.2020.1785516"", ""10.2307/2717097"", ""10.1057/9780230609754"", ""10.5149/uncp/9780807849972"", ""10.7312/parm14628"", ""10.1353/kri.2011.a411667"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-56505-1_6"", ""10.1093/jahist/96.3.727"", ""10.1080/03057070.2017.1278982"", ""10.1017/S0021853721000268"", ""10.1017/S174002281900007X"", ""10.25162/9783515111195"", ""10.1017/S002185371900032X"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511584091"", ""10.4324/9781315627175-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91325-4"", ""10.5149/uncp/9780807830086"", ""10.1017/S0007680511001188"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139681001"", ""10.2307/2294364"", ""10.5323/jafriamerhist.100.2.0272"", ""10.1515/9781400876303-009""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Yet the dominant framework for understanding property claims in postclassical jurisprudence was ill-fitted to claims of the kind that agrarian movements in colonial Bengal were articulating. As a result, twentieth-century agrarian movements in the region spoke the language offiqh, but nonetheless inhabited the ideological landscape of a much broader twentieth-century world of political aspirations and norms.","[{""name"": ""ANDREW SARTORI"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511626104.009"", ""10.1177/001946466400100101"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226734866.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230289819_4"", ""10.1525/9780520957572"", ""10.2307/1596022"", ""10.5040/9780755609772"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511493751.005"", ""10.1525/9780520917774-013""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/S0018246X19000499,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,PROJECTIONS OF DESIRE AND DESIGN IN EARLY MODERN CARIBBEAN MAPS,"AbstractIconic early European maps of the Caribbean depict neatly parcelled plantations, sugar mills, towns, and fortifications juxtaposed against untamed interiors sketched with runaway slaves and Indigenous toponyms. These extra-geographical symbols of racial and spatial meaning projected desire and design to powerful audiences. Abstractions about material life influenced colonial perceptions and actions upon a space, often to deleterious effects for the Indigenous and African people who were abused in tandem with the region's flora and fauna. The scientific revolution curbed these proscriptive and descriptive ‘thick-mapped’ features that offer historians an underexplored record of early colonial Caribbean life beyond the geographically descriptive. Before this shift from mystery to mastery, the early correlation of colonization and cartography in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries provides a fascinating glimpse into the process of creating the Americas. This article offers ideas for deconstructing old maps as new sources for historians of the early Atlantic World. As digital readers may explore through the roughly fifty maps linked via the footnotes, their informative spectacle naturalized colonialism upon lived and imagined race and space, created an exoticized, commodified Caribbean, and facilitated wealth extraction projects of competing empires made profitable by African labour on Indigenous land.","[{""name"": ""ANGELA SUTTON"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""CHARLTON W.

One of these unresolved questions concerns whether Keynes (1931) later changed his mind in response to intense criticism from Frank Ramsey (1922, 1931) and abandoned the logical theory of probability. This essay draws from Cheryl Misak’s recent biography of Frank Ramsey (2020) to argue that Ramsey had an even wider influence on Keynes’s work than has been recognized, and that this influence was not just on his philosophy of probability but also on his economics. Understood in this fuller context, it seems even more clear that Keynes embraced and built upon Ramsey’s subjective theory of probability in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936).","[{""name"": ""Bradley W.

This interesting combination has made Rust very popular among developers and there is a growing trend of migrating legacy codebases (very often in C) to Rust. In this paper, we present a C to Rust translation approach centred around static ownership analysis. We design a suite of analyses that infer ownership models of C pointers and automatically translate the pointers into safe Rust equivalents. The resulting tool, Crown, scales to real-world codebases (half a million lines of code in less than 10 s) and achieves a high conversion rate.","[{""name"": ""Hanliang Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cristina David"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yijun Yu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Meng Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/582419.582448"", ""10.1145/3428204"", ""10.1145/3360573"", ""10.1145/604131.604156"", ""10.1145/781131.781168"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-024X(19980710)28:8<859::AID-SPE188>3.0.CO;2-8"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2006.04.008"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2006.12.034"", ""10.1109/LICS.2007.30"", ""10.1145/349299.349311"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36946-9_3"", ""10.1145/286936.286947"", ""10.1145/349299.349309"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31057-7_29"", ""10.1145/3586046"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5442253"", ""10.1145/3485498"", ""10.1145/3377811.3380413"", ""10.1145/1480881.1480922"", ""10.1145/1186632.1186635"", ""10.1145/1297027.1297051"", ""10.1145/1181775.1181785"", ""10.1145/781131.781150"", ""10.1145/2384616.2384680"", ""10.1145/3158154"", ""10.1017/S0956796818000151"", ""10.1109/ASE.2015.9"", ""10.1145/1926385.1926389"", ""10.1145/3510454.3528640"", ""10.1145/3527322"", ""10.1145/2663171.2663188"", ""10.1145/3519939.3523704"", ""10.1145/3462205"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49122-5_2"", ""10.1145/1542476.1542516"", ""10.1145/1122971.1122992"", ""10.1145/3485522"", ""10.1145/2491411.2491439"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2008.04.001""]",['Computer Science'],"['Hardware and Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

Time and Imagined Communities in Nineteenth-Century Germany,"AbstractMany Germans defended local time well beyond 1893, when Germany adopted a time standard bearing on the life of the entire nation. Yet the defining feature of Germany's temporal landscape was its multilayered nature, with North and South adopting different temporal regimes and undergoing different experiences. Focusing on the spread of (railway-induced) standard time and the responses it provoked, this article offers an investigation of German time culture in the nineteenth century. Out of curiosity and because their lives depended on it, Germans took an interest in obtaining the right time from the frequently contradictory horological landscapes they inhabited. Yet their shared curiosity did not breed conformity. The inspectors of the station clocks concerned with accuracy and synchronicity; the townsfolk in southern Germany who fast-forwarded their favorite public clock in order to get to the station in time; the Prussian scientists and villagers who opposed railway time becoming public time—they all, in their own way, contributed to putting time back in its place.","[{""name"": ""Oliver Zimmer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139087377"", ""10.1017/S0008938916000868"", ""10.1093/past/181.1.107"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226015057.001.0001"", ""10.1515/hzhz-2019-0002"", ""10.1515/9783112369586-018"", ""10.4159/9780674915992"", ""10.1017/S0022050700095395"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719082719.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781503626577"", ""10.1086/448970"", ""10.1017/S0007087400004210"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226257860.001.0001"", ""10.5149/9780807868171_allen""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

The article presents a mixed reality based digital shopping assistant which aims to provide retail customers with a holistic shopping experience. Design science research methodology is used to develop this physical artifact that comprises of assisting elements: product information, reviews, recommendations and a buy button. A study was conducted with two different head-mounted displays (Microsoft HoloLens and HoloLens 2) where 29 participants evaluated the proposed physical artifact and brings out the relationship between shopping experience constructs that constitutes a modern omnichannel retail customer experience. Results show a positive attitude of customers towards the technology. Differences between the two-head mounted displays were observed in terms of perceived privacy issues. Technology adoption, enjoyment and security beliefs of the customers are observed to have a significant effect on the user’s intention to use the technology. The results also reveal that a customer’s perceived convenience, perceived service quality, attitude towards the retailer and the word of mouth are affected significantly by their intention to use the technology. These results, along with qualitative comments from the participants are used to extract research, development and deployment implications for future iterations of shopping assistant systems based on mixed reality.","[{""name"": ""Shubham Jain"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas Schweiss"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simon Bender"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dirk Werth"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1509/jm.15.0420"", ""10.1016/j.elerap.2018.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.006"", ""10.1016/j.jretai.2020.10.006"", ""10.1177/009207002236914"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2018.02.004"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-5653-8"", ""10.2753/MIS0742-1222240302"", ""10.14742/ajet.899"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2020.102160"", ""10.15764/MR.2014.01002"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-22335-9_2"", ""10.1109/ICTER.2017.8257810"", ""10.1145/3340764.3340800"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.10.050"", ""10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7473143"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2016.03.004"", ""10.1145/3365871.3365899"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66715-7_61"", ""10.25300/MISQ/2017/41.1.05"", ""10.1177/0887302X16633530"", ""10.1016/j.jretai.2008.11.001"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01117"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.09.022"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2016.10.005"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-76935-2_3"", ""10.1287/ISRE.1080.0193"", ""10.1145/2043932.2043962"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2018.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.jretai.2011.04.007""]","['Social Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

This strand of critical research, as opposed to instrumentalist approaches, is the focus of this review. In line with the scope of the journal, the review looks at nation branding research that relates to the countries of the former communist bloc. The analysis finds that the state of the field is fragmented due to its multi-disciplinary nature. It is also argued that the field may be suffering from methodological nationalism. The discussion identifies epistemological and theoretical approaches, pointing out gaps and limitations along the way. It is suggested that research in the field can be grouped into “identity studies” and “practice studies” as a way to better understand key theoretical influences. Finally, it is proposed that future research should look at nation branding both as a field of practice that merits critical examination in its own right and as a lens that can be used to investigate changes in the state of nationhood today.","[{""name"": ""Nadia Kaneva"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780203806814"", ""10.1177/1367877910382181"", ""10.1177/0191453713494969"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-11336-1"", ""10.2307/j.ctvw04dpw.14"", ""10.1080/09592296.2019.1671000"", ""10.1163/9789004305496"", ""10.1177/1469540517690570"", ""10.1057/palgrave.pb.5990019"", ""10.1111/nana.12520"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199752164.001.0001"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_474310"", ""10.1108/JPBM-09-2016-1320"", ""10.1177/1367549417751153"", ""10.1017/nps.2019.123"", ""10.1108/IMR-01-2019-0028"", ""10.2307/j.ctvw04dpw.11"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-76759-8_4"", ""10.1007/s12208-017-0181-3"", ""10.1057/palgrave.bm.2540075"", ""10.4324/9781315794662"", ""10.1086/684613"", ""10.1111/nana.12171"", ""10.1353/imp.2012.0078"", ""10.1080/15405700802198113"", ""10.1080/02634937.2015.1016799"", ""10.1525/9780520957268"", ""10.4324/9780367821579"", ""10.4324/9781315208671"", ""10.1111/soc4.12186"", ""10.1057/s41254-016-0018-6"", ""10.1080/02757206.2012.759111"", ""10.21018/rjcpr.2017.1.229"", ""10.1080/21599165.2013.877712"", ""10.1080/13504630701848721"", ""10.1177/1367549417751149"", ""10.4324/9781315393261"", ""10.1080/09668130903068657"", ""10.1057/jird.2014.14"", ""10.1163/9789004224230_011"", ""10.1177/1367549417751151"", ""10.1080/00905992.2017.1287167"", ""10.2307/j.ctvw04dpw.15""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

An early-twentieth-century evolution of military technology that shifted the demand for workers of different stature illustrates the importance of labor demand beyond the commonly discussed influences originating with labor supply. English-born soldiers in the Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902) were taller, on average, than those of World War I (1914–18), yet these differences cannot be attributed to standard of living or business cycle influences on the labor market. Rather, we argue, the mechanization and bureaucratization of warfare increased the relative value of shorter people permitting a decline in the average height of soldiers. Technological change over the period of these two wars affected labor demand in a way that must be recognized before using this evidence to test hypotheses about changes in population health.","[{""name"": ""Johan Fourie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kris Inwood"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martine Mariotti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0022050718000694"", ""10.3200/HMTS.37.4.186-197"", ""10.1163/156853010X524316"", ""10.1016/j.ehb.2007.09.002"", ""10.2307/1986064"", ""10.1017/S0022050708000673"", ""10.3200/HMTS.37.4.160-173"", ""10.1017/S0022050700021161"", ""10.1006/exeh.1994.1007"", ""10.1179/0729247314Z.00000000033"", ""10.1007/s00191-009-0141-0"", ""10.1017/S002205071900055X"", ""10.1017/S002205070002917X"", ""10.1111/ehr.12099"", ""10.1353/jmh.2007.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-0262.00150"", ""10.1353/jmh.2007.0062"", ""10.1111/1467-8446.00072"", ""10.1017/S0022050717000031"", ""10.1080/03086534.2017.1332131"", ""10.1111/aehr.12069"", ""10.1353/jmh.2006.0106"", ""10.1017/S0022050719000573"", ""10.1016/j.ehb.2003.12.003"", ""10.1080/20780389.2013.866382""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Soil Science', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7714), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Our results suggest that the presence of maternal and paternal grandmothers in the city living in different households were associated with reduced child mortality and that French-Canadian women who arrived in the United States as children or young adults experienced higher child mortality compared to second-generation French Canadians and those who migrated at a later age.","[{""name"": ""Marie-Ève Harton"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J.

It challenges accounts of anti-malaria policies at the League of Nations Health Organization and at the World Health Organization written from a Western, particularly North American perspective, or on the basis of local reactions to Western interventions. The contribution proposes an analysis of circulations and ideas across multiple cultural, social and political spaces: post-imperial European states, (post)colonial territories and bureaucracies of international organizations. From the 1920s to the 1960s, Eastern European experts played a crucial role in the transformation of malaria from an imperial disease that tested governance over ‘tropical’ peoples into an issue of global health and nation-state building. However, regional representatives reproduced civilizational hierarchies intrinsic to North–South biomedical relations. The global entanglements of Eastern European malariology show that liberation from disease was less about communism or liberalism, and more about national renewal, statehood and world hierarchies.","[{""name"": ""Bogdan C.

By tracing the evolution of the Mouvement de libération nationale des Comores (MOLINACO) around East Africa's Indian Ocean basin, this article explores the possibilities and constraints of anticolonial organisation among a diaspora population whose own existence was threatened by the more exclusive political order that emerged from the process of decolonisation. In Tanganyika, Zanzibar, Kenya, and Madagascar, MOLINACO's activities were shaped and limited by contested issues of racial identity, island genealogy, partisan alignment, and international priorities among both the Comorian diaspora and their ‘host’ governments. Through a transterritorial approach, this article examines the difficulties for minority communities in navigating the transition from empire to nation-state, while also illustrating the challenges MOLINACO faced in its ultimately unsuccessful attempt to impose that same normative model onto the archipelago.","[{""name"": ""George Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139681001"", ""10.4159/9780674028579"", ""10.4000/etudesrurales.10099"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190071301.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5cg87w"", ""10.1017/S0010417518000427"", ""10.1017/S0021853714000322"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199899142.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S000197201000001X"", ""10.1163/9789004365988"", ""10.1017/S0021853719000483"", ""10.1017/S0021853710000253"", ""10.1017/S0018246X18000407"", ""10.2307/j.ctv224txv2.9"", ""10.1525/california/9780520244535.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0021853720000341"", ""10.1017/S0021853721000189"", ""10.1017/9781108990721"", ""10.1017/S0021853714000139"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199451753.001.0001"", ""10.1080/17531055.2015.1091639"", ""10.1017/S0010417508000364"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316162958"", ""10.1093/ahr/123.3.846"", ""10.3917/lms.236.0061"", ""10.1017/S0021853702008319"", ""10.2307/j.ctv224ttsk"", ""10.1515/9780748695447-010"", ""10.1093/pastj/gty045"", ""10.3406/cea.1983.2260"", ""10.4000/africanistes.819"", ""10.4159/9780674286894""]",['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Competition, adaptation and resilience in textile manufacturing in the 'periphery', 1860-1960","AbstractThis article analyses the resilience of domestic textile production in Java and sub-Saharan Africa to uncover how local industries coped with the effects of broader global and colonial forces in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. We demonstrate that many domestic handicraft manufacturers managed to survive due to specific competitive advantages. Strategies of product differentiation, responsiveness to shifting consumer needs, and flexibility in manufacturing methods enabled local producers to remain competitive in confrontation with mounting imports from early factories, typically constituting cheap, but lower quality and less unique products. Some local manufacturers could even compete based on price given the very low labour costs associated with seasonally-oriented handicraft production, which raises questions about the extent of the comparative advantage enjoyed by early-industrializing nations in the Global North. The capacity of domestic textile producers to remain competitive amid colonial policies aimed at capturing local markets – and raw cotton sources – highlights not only the importance of product differentiation and the specificity of local demand, but also the agency exercised by both producers and consumers under colonial rule.","[{""name"": ""Katharine Frederick"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elise van Nederveen Meerkerk"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Current approaches are limited in that the linear bounds must be handcrafted by an expert, and can be sub-optimal, especially when the network’s architecture composes operations using, for example, multiplication such as in LSTMs and the recently popularSwishactivation. The dependence on an expert prevents the application of robustness certification to developments in the state-of-the-art of activation functions, and furthermore the lack of tightness guarantees may give a false sense of insecurity about a particular model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider the problem ofautomaticallysynthesizingtightlinear bounds for arbitrary n-dimensional activation functions. We propose the first fully automated method that achieves tight linear bounds while only leveraging the mathematical definition of the activation function itself. Our method leverages an efficient heuristic technique to synthesize bounds that are tight andusually sound, and then verifies the soundness (and adjusts the bounds if necessary) using the highly optimized branch-and-bound SMT solver,dReal. Even though our method depends on an SMT solver, we show that the runtime is reasonable in practice, and, compared with state of the art, our method often achieves 2-5X tighter final output bounds and more than quadruple certified robustness.","[{""name"": ""Brandon Paulsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chao Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.18653/v1/D18-1316"", ""10.1145/3319535.3354245"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013240"", ""10.1137/0916069"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2009.03.002"", ""10.1145/512950.512973"", ""10.1145/512760.512770"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38574-2_14"", ""10.1109/SP.2018.00058"", ""10.1109/HIS.2008.40"", ""10.1109/CDC42340.2020.9304296"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00467"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96142-2_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-85037-1_8"", ""10.1137/1.9780898717716"", ""10.1145/3377811.3380337"", ""10.1145/3324884.3416560"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_10"", ""10.1145/3290354"", ""10.1109/ICCV48922.2021.01611"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30942-8_39"", ""10.1609/aaai.v35i13.17388""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

To this aim they manipulate over-approximations of program semantics and, inevitably, they often report some false alarms. Recently, O’Hearn proposed Incorrectness Logic, that is based on under-approximations, as a formal method to find bugs that only reports true alarms. In this paper we aim to answer one important question raised by O’Hearn, namely which role can Abstract Interpretation play for the development of under-approximate tools for bug catching. In principle, Abstract Interpretation based static analyses can be defined for computing over-approximations as well as under-approximations, but in practice, most techniques exploited the former while few attempts developed the latter. To show why it is difficult to design effective under-approximation abstract domains, we first propose the new definitions of non emptying functions and highly surjective function family and then we formally prove the limits of under-approximation analysis by showing the non existence of abstract domains able to approximate such functions in a non trivial way. Our results outline the limits of under-approximation Abstract Interpretation and clarify, for the first time, why over- and under- approximation analyzers exhibited such a different development.","[{""name"": ""Flavio Ascari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roberto Bruni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roberta Gori"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/9781118602867"", ""10.1145/173262.155095"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_1"", ""10.1109/ICCL.1994.288389"", ""10.1145/512950.512973"", ""10.1145/567752.567778"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-35873-9_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-18275-4_12"", ""10.1145/3338112"", ""10.1090/psapm/019/0235771"", ""10.1145/363235.363259"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2013.09.014"", ""10.1561/2500000034"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-03811-6"", ""10.1145/3209108.3209109"", ""10.1145/3371078"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_14"", ""10.1109/LICS.2002.1029817"", ""10.1145/3188720"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2006.03.008""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

It also shows that family ties and affective relationships mattered a great deal to working-class Victorians. Some found new ways to give meaning to their relationship with, and the life of, their incarcerated relative, despite the costs this entailed. By taking a new approach – engaging with the history of the family, shifting focus from patients to their individual family members, and considering factors including age, class, gender, change over time, and life stage – this article demonstrates the breadth and depth of the effects of asylum committal, and in doing so provides new and significant insights into the history of the Victorian asylum. It also enriches the history of the family by providing an insight into working-class quotidian lives, bonds, and emotions.","[{""name"": ""JADE SHEPHERD"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09612020903282118"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198203827.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230235359_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-60390-2"", ""10.1080/09612020500530588"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-20785-1_9"", ""10.1093/ahr/123.1.60"", ""10.1057/9780230250796_5"", ""10.2307/j.ctvb4bst7"", ""10.1093/shm/11.2.255"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719075032.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195039573.001.0001"", ""10.1093/shm/hkn030"", ""10.1177/0957154X9800903602"", ""10.1007/BF00157532"", ""10.4324/9780203335345"", ""10.1057/9781137321435"", ""10.1093/shm/hkv061"", ""10.4324/9780203428047_chapter_7"", ""10.1017/S0018246X12000404"", ""10.1177/036319909401900202"", ""10.1093/jsh/shs091"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04855-6_7"", ""10.1017/S026841600000268X"", ""10.1017/mdh.2016.56"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496080"", ""10.1017/mdh.2015.65"", ""10.3138/9781442628069"", ""10.2307/j.ctvh1dh7v"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198788492.001.0001"", ""10.1177/036319900002500305"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316027059"", ""10.5040/9798400649912"", ""10.1163/9789042026322_005"", ""10.1093/hwj/20.1.134"", ""10.1525/9780520932210"", ""10.1093/shm/hkm043"", ""10.1080/13555502.2012.751045""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

This article seeks to explore the different ways in which pilgrimage was embedded in the culture of the period. We interpret pilgrimage as a field of shared cross-confessional practices, representational conventions, and contestation. The paper presents a series of interlinked case studies, based on printed sources, correspondence, family archives, and material evidence. Together they demonstrate that early modern pilgrimage perpetuated medieval practices and yet was in constant dialogue with contemporary, post-Reformation religious and intellectual trends.","[{""name"": ""Sundar Henny"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zur Shalev"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/jbr.2021.113,JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES,0603 World History,"Jacobitism, Coastal Policing, and Fiscal-Military Reform in England after the Glorious Revolution, 1689-1702","AbstractCustoms activity during the 1690s has mainly been studied from a fiscal-military perspective that attributes administrative growth and bureaucratic efficiency to the rise of fiscal necessities in the wake of the Nine Years’ War. This article challenges that view with a focus on the one truly momentous change of the Customs during the 1690s: the establishment of a preventive coastal police. Changes in the Customs were occasioned not primarily by fiscal concerns but resulted from the government's preoccupation with Jacobitism and the successful lobbying of Parliament by the wool interest. As the politics of the wool ban before 1689 demonstrate, coastal policing was a losing bargain in fiscal terms and mainly reflected the interests of certain sections of the merchant community. Fiscal pressures alone do not, therefore, explain the fundamental reform of the Customs in the wake of the Glorious Revolution. The beginnings of systematic coastal policing are instead linked to the rise of Parliament and anti-Jacobite precautions of William III's government. The article offers a new, coherent picture of such changes and calls into question the validity of a central assumption about the rise of the fiscal-military state in Britain after the Glorious Revolution, suggesting a more complicated explanation for fiscal reforms.","[{""name"": ""Hannes Ziegler"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/385978"", ""10.1006/jhge.1998.0088"", ""10.2307/2597330"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199259212.003.0008"", ""10.1017/S1474691300002845"", ""10.2307/2590859"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-03540-3"", ""10.1080/00253359.2006.10656991"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199241934.003.0005"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-81676-7_7"", ""10.1093/ehr/cev043"", ""10.1017/9781139057875.012""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The focus is the politics of survival in the chaos of collapse and the controversial debates about the agenda of the reconstruction. In these discussions different visions competed, from the restoration of traditions to efforts of a post-fascist modernization. The introduction questions the postwar success narrative by discussing the “burdens” of the Nazi past, such as Nazi perpetrators, displaced people, expellees and refugees, including the returning German-Jewish survivors. It also engages with the problems of the Cold War division by exploring the “new beginnings”, which were debated in relation to the past of Nazi, Weimar, and Imperial Germany, among them: cultural diplomacy, welfare policy and eldercare, family policy and gender roles, and popular culture. The essay calls for more comparative and transnational research of the postwar era, especially in the areas of the integration into the Cold War blocs, the postwar shifting of borders and peoples, narratives of victimhood, and memory tropes about the war and postwar.","[{""name"": ""Karen Hagemann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Konrad H.

10.1017/S1479244319000246,MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY,0603 World History,"In Search of Perfection: Neo-spiritualism, Islamic Mysticism, and Secularism in Turkey","This article scrutinizes a little-known venture in Turkish republican intellectual history, namely Turkish neo-spiritualism. Combining the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Western trend of modern spiritualism with its local dynamics and sociocultural structures, Turkish neo-spiritualism integrated the spiritual philosophies and practices of Western spiritualism with various doctrines of Islamic mysticism (Sufism). It thus sheds light on the complex ways in which a form of knowledge that was originated and disseminated from the West was not derivative in its “imported” version. The article demonstrates how modern spiritualism attained new meanings and connotations in Turkey by merging with indigenous cultural codes and memory, and how it responded to (or was shaped within) local sociopolitical as well as intellectual contexts, particularly including the top-down secularism of the early Turkish Republic.","[{""name"": ""Kutluğhan Soyubol"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199746682.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822388463"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226184340.001.0001"", ""10.1037/13314-000"", ""10.56021/9780801878121"", ""10.1525/9780520947856"", ""10.1215/00161071-26-1-119"", ""10.2979/jottturstuass.2.2.08"", ""10.1086/354775"", ""10.1017/S0010417516000098"", ""10.1111/1745-8315.12364"", ""10.1163/9789004264083_013"", ""10.1515/9781503626744-004"", ""10.3917/puf.baube.2010.01"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0424.2010.01612.x"", ""10.1215/1089201x-4389979"", ""10.1525/california/9780520225268.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226465111.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226403533.001.0001"", ""10.1163/19585705-12341375"", ""10.1353/sor.2009.0020"", ""10.1057/9780230117037"", ""10.1017/S1479244309990205"", ""10.1515/9780804783095"", ""10.1353/book.1855"", ""10.26650/AB/CH36.2022.155"", ""10.2307/1595320"", ""10.1163/157006501X00159""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

By employing a high-frequency data set of bank transactions, this study reveals how these severe shocks influenced the banking activities of clients. The findings reveal a multifaceted and significant impact of tropical storm strikes on the banks’ operations, particularly a surge in borrowing via overdrafts of current accounts. Moreover, the study reveals the multifaceted nature of such storms’ impact on the bank’s functionality, with affected branches demonstrating an uptick in deposits and savings as a strategy to mitigate funding shocks. The results of the econometric analysis indicate that the impact of such storms on banks’ functionality during the early 20th century was significant and multidimensional. It highlights the critical role that the Colonial Bank plays in facilitating recovery from these devastating events and contributes to the existing literature by studying multiple shocks at different geographical locations and time frames.","[{""name"": ""Joel Huesler"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jfs.2022.101002"", ""10.37625/abr.25.2.452-487"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3438326"", ""10.1016/j.latcb.2021.100023"", ""10.1016/j.jfi.2012.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.12.020"", ""10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0258.1"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3961081"", ""10.1890/0012-9615(2001)071[0027:LARIOH]2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1890/02-4057"", ""10.1016/j.econmod.2022.105760"", ""10.1257/aer.102.3.238"", ""10.1093/ej/49.Supplement_1.297"", ""10.1016/j.qref.2018.12.004"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139031264"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2017.04.011"", ""10.3386/w20713"", ""10.1080/1351847X.2022.2055969"", ""10.1111/irfi.12294"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-2828-0_5"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2023.2256507"", ""10.1175/1520-0442(2004)017<2813:AHBATS>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1038/nature03906"", ""10.1257/pol.20140273"", ""10.1175/1520-0493(1980)108<1212:AAMOTW>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1215/01636545-1724733"", ""10.1215/07990537-2642737"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4536722"", ""10.1016/j.ememar.2021.100846"", ""10.5194/essd-9-927-2017"", ""10.1016/j.jfi.2019.01.003"", ""10.1016/S0048-9697(00)00526-X"", ""10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.12.008"", ""10.1175/WCAS-D-12-00029.1"", ""10.1017/S1355770X16000176"", ""10.1007/s10797-020-09622-5"", ""10.1093/oso/9780197555446.001.0001"", ""10.1353/book.3459"", ""10.1080/00036846.2023.2293675"", ""10.1080/1351847X.2018.1562952"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2023.102792"", ""10.1111/jmcb.13018"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-0321-5"", ""10.1007/s11069-011-0069-1"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1527-6988(2008)9:1(29)"", ""10.2307/3115963"", ""10.2139/ssrn.879049"", ""10.1111/j.1538-4616.2008.00122.x"", ""10.1093/rof/rfy010"", ""10.3197/096734012X13225062753660"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00082"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2010.12.002"", ""10.1038/s41893-018-0165-2"", ""10.1007/s11356-021-17617-w""]","['Social Sciences', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Cultural Studies', 'Atmospheric Science', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0706 大气科学', 0.7502), ('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7343)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Our contention is that the outcomes of such entanglements are not merely reactive forms of knowledge, of the kind implied by older studies of translation and reception in global intellectual history. Instead they are themselves ‘co-productions’: they are the shared and mutually interactive inputs to enduring modes of uses of the past, across both East Asian and European traditions. Taking seriously the possibility that interpretations of the past were not transferred, but rather were co-produced between East Asia and Europe, we reconstruct the braided histories of historical narratives that continue to shape constructions of identity throughout Eurasia.","[{""name"": ""LEIGH K.

In this paper, we investigate DNS resolution in a strict IPv6-only scenario and find that a substantial fraction of zones cannot be resolved. We point out, that the presence of an resource record for a zone’s nameserver does not necessarily imply that it is resolvable in an IPv6-only environment since the full DNS delegation chain must resolve via IPv6 as well. Hence, in an IPv6-only setting zones may experience an effect similar to what is commonly referred to as lame delegation.Our longitudinal study shows that the continuing centralization of the Internet has a large impact on IPv6 readiness, i.e., a small number of large DNS providers has, and still can, influence IPv6 readiness for a large number of zones. A single operator that enabled IPv6 DNS resolution–by adding IPv6 glue records–was responsible for around 20.3% of all zones in our dataset not resolving over IPv6 until January 2017. Even today, 10% of DNS operators are responsible for more than 97.5% of all zones that do not resolve using IPv6 .","[{""name"": ""Florian Streibelt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Patrick Sattler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Franziska Lichtblau"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carlos H.

Whether it is Donald Trump in the USA, Vladimir Putin in Russia, Bolsonaro in Brazil, Orbán in Hungary, Modi in India, the past decade the world has witnessed the rise of leaders claiming the nation for dominant ethnic groups, excluding and targeting ethnic minorities and immigrants. In this article I argue that this preexisting plague of exclusionary nationalism has made the COVID-19 pandemic more dangerous for our body politics than it might otherwise have been. Following from our evolutionary tendency to associate foreigners with disease, all epidemics hold the potential to raise boundaries between ingroups and outgroups and scapegoat the latter. Yet this noxious seed of division latent in all contagions has flourished in the case of COVID-19, as it was planted in the fertile soil of exclusionary nationalism where boundaries between countries, and majority and minority-group boundaries within countries, were already furrowed deep. I delineate how through the pandemic, right-wing, populist, exclusionary nationalist governments have further exacerbated both these types of us-them divides. In concluding, however, I point out how in line with its well-known Janus nature, nationalism has also played a more constructive role during the pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Prerna Singh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9781400820849"", ""10.1177/1468796808088925"", ""10.1177/1368430204046142"", ""10.1080/15265161.2016.1214305"", ""10.2307/25157817"", ""10.1017/S153759272000078X"", ""10.1017/gov.2012.11"", ""10.1080/01436597.2015.1111753"", ""10.1111/nana.12522"", ""10.3386/w28395"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558764"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00690.x"", ""10.1017/gov.2019.17"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12188"", ""10.1177/00333549101250S315"", ""10.1017/nps.2020.40"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000405"", ""10.1111/nana.12644"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107295582"", ""10.1017/nps.2020.35"", ""10.1177/0002716216662639"", ""10.1007/s12116-012-9100-0"", ""10.1086/704438"", ""10.1093/heapro/dau028"", ""10.1007/s12116-021-09337-6"", ""10.2307/3791647"", ""10.1080/17457289.2011.539483"", ""10.1017/S0140525X11000021"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-081715-074412"", ""10.1080/13569317.2015.1075264"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2281.2012.00603.x"", ""10.1068/d2208"", ""10.1111/1468-0009.00030"", ""10.1111/nana.12515"", ""10.1177/0010414009331721"", ""10.1016/0277-9536(94)90366-2"", ""10.1080/21565503.2020.1769693"", ""10.1177/0010414013512600"", ""10.1111/j.1747-1346.2009.00200.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139104005"", ""10.1007/s12116-015-9198-y"", ""10.1215/03616878-22-4-993"", ""10.1177/0003122416663683"", ""10.1017/ipo.2016.6"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2005.tb00327.x"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00331""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The Case of Ukraine in 2014-2018,"AbstractThis article elucidates the role of historians in times of war and the peculiarities of popular history narratives written by historians who became activists. The article focuses on historians who call themselves “Likbez. Historical Front.” This cohort gave rise to a new professional species—activist historians—who are different from so called memorians or propagandists, who work in service of authorities. Likbez historians tried to use their power to influence and promote their activist agenda not only in the realm of memory and history but also in reformation of state institutions. I argue that for Likbez historians, securitization of the past is the main strategy employed for producing historical knowledge. Historians’ work is a part of postcolonizing process observed in Ukrainian society since the Maidan protests. As the analysis shows, popular history narratives written with an open activist agenda are a result of many compromises made by scholars in the intersection of several factors: professional ambitions, political and civic aims, social and political context, popular expectations, and market environment. In line with the increased attention to agency in memory studies, this article demonstrates that historians have a much more nuanced relation to power than straightforward opposition or co-option.","[{""name"": ""Yuliya Yurchuk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/978-1-349-95269-4"", ""10.1353/imp.2017.0083"", ""10.1177/1750698012470837"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1391671"", ""10.3138/9781442689534"", ""10.1177/1750698017727806"", ""10.1177/1367549419869351"", ""10.1515/9781400843251"", ""10.1080/17512786.2016.1163237"", ""10.1177/0022009416664020"", ""10.3726/978-1-4539-1878-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66523-8_4"", ""10.3138/9781442682948"", ""10.3167/9781789201994"", ""10.1177/1750698018800740"", ""10.2307/j.ctv62hhpn"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-95269-4_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-43201-4"", ""10.1080/01629770802461191"", ""10.18523/kmlpj120120.2017-3.137-156"", ""10.1080/00085006.2011.11092690"", ""10.1080/09668130701489139"", ""10.1017/S0960777317000431"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0130.2007.00422.x""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Cultural Studies', 'Social Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This article explores the patterns of migration to the city by continental goldsmiths between 1480 and 1540 and the structure of the communities they formed. It argues that attitudes to migration within the London Goldsmiths’ Company, which governed the trade, were complex and shifted in response to evolving national legislation. A social network analysis of the relationships between alien masters and servants indicates how the alien community changed and adapted. Taking a view across the traditional late medieval and early modern period boundary allows for a deeper understanding of how attitudes to migration and to migrant communities changed as London's population began to grow.","[{""name"": ""Charlotte Berry"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511522772"", ""10.1017/9781316219027"", ""10.1017/S0022050700021124"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496738"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199562732.001.0001"", ""10.1017/jbr.2016.75"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198201571.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0963926807004348"", ""10.1080/13562570600796747"", ""10.1111/1477-4658.00010"", ""10.1017/jbr.2017.178"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00411.x"", ""10.1215/10829636-2338599"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195311754.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199257775.001.0001"", ""10.1257/jep.28.4.169"", ""10.1017/S0022050700052554"", ""10.4324/9781315577692"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198798149.001.0001"", ""10.1093/past/154.1.3"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2004.00279.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00417.x""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

We extend Wang et al.’s CertiGraph platform to reason about labels on edges, undirected graphs, and common spatial representations of edge-labeled graphs such as adjacency matrices and edge lists. We certify binary heaps, including Floyd’s bottom-up heap construction, heapsort, and increase/decrease priority.Our verifications uncover subtle overflows implicit in standard textbook code, including a nontrivial bound on edge weights necessary to execute Dijkstra’s algorithm; we show that the intuitive guess fails and provide a workable refinement. We observe that the common notion that Prim’s algorithm requires a connected graph is wrong: we verify that a standard textbook implementation of Prim’s algorithm can compute minimum spanning forests without finding components first. Our verification of Kruskal’s algorithm reasons about two graphs simultaneously: the undirected graph undergoing MSF construction, and the directed graph representing the forest inside union-find. Our binary heap verification exposes precise bounds for the heap to operate correctly, avoids a subtle overflow error, and shows how to recycle keys to avoid overflow.","[{""name"": ""Anshuman Mohan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wei Xiang Leow"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aquinas Hobor"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5281/zenodo.4744664"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49812-6"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107256552"", ""10.1093/imamat/15.2.161"", ""10.1007/11804192_17"", ""10.1007/11804192_6"", ""10.1007/s10009-007-0044-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-06410-9_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_1"", ""10.1145/2034773.2034828"", ""10.1007/s10817-017-9431-7"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2010.07.004"", ""10.1145/1993498.1993526"", ""10.1007/3-540-58450-1_40"", ""10.1007/BF01386390"", ""10.1145/2500365.2500613"", ""10.1007/s10009-014-0308-3"", ""10.1016/j.jlamp.2021.100645"", ""10.1145/355588.365103"", ""10.1145/512274.512284"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-39724-3_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46750-4_4"", ""10.1016/j.jlamp.2018.09.005"", ""10.1145/2429069.2429131"", ""10.1137/1.9780898719918"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009855"", ""10.1145/3158125"", ""10.26226/morressier.6052140bb625b5ccab534260"", ""10.1090/S0002-9939-1956-0078686-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08970-6_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-51054-1_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-43144-4_14"", ""10.1007/s10817-017-9442-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-17511-4_20"", ""10.1145/1111037.1111042"", ""10.1109/ICST.2012.90"", ""10.1007/11541868_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98047-8_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49122-5_2"", ""10.1007/s11786-014-0183-z"", ""10.1007/3-540-44802-0_1"", ""10.2168/LMCS-6(3:6)2010"", ""10.1002/j.1538-7305.1957.tb01515.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-47958-3_17"", ""10.1561/9781680835953"", ""10.1007/978-1-84800-070-4"", ""10.1145/322261.322272"", ""10.1145/3360597""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

However, many proven educational tools are designed for collaborative, co-located classroom work. Effective sketching and ideating tools, such as card-based workshop tools, cannot be applied in remote teaching.This paper explores how the paper-based card and playboard metaphor can be digitized for remote student co-creation via video call sessions. Therefore, a card-based toolkit for co-creating educational games is transformed into a digital representation for remote application. In a between-subject trial with two university student groups (n = 61), it is investigated how users perceive ideation/balancing support and applicability of the technology-enhanced card toolset compared to the paper-based variant. Both groups thereby created an analytic game concept for privacy education.The results remarkably revealed that remote co-creation using the technology-enhanced card and playboard in video call sessions was perceived as significantly more supportive for ideation and game concept balancing. Students also felt more confident to apply the digitized card toolset independently while being more satisfied with their created game concepts. The designed educational game concepts showed comparable patterns between the groups and disclosed the students’ preferences on how games for privacy education should be designed and when and where they would like to play them. Conclusively, design implications for digital card ideation toolsets were synthesized from the findings.","[{""name"": ""Patrick Jost"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Monica Divitini"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3270316.3270610"", ""10.1145/3064663.3064699"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-40612-1"", ""10.1145/2675133.2675287"", ""10.1111/spc3.12507"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-40483-2_34"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2019.04.002"", ""10.1145/3357236.3395516"", ""10.1080/15710882.2020.1715444"", ""10.1504/IJART.2013.050688"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-11932-4_82"", ""10.1145/1943403.1943428"", ""10.1007/s10639-016-9483-z"", ""10.1145/3337722.3341841"", ""10.1007/s11846-020-00400-5"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2020.1814867"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02031.x"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155"", ""10.1037/h0055392""]","['Social Sciences', 'Decision Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Little attention has been paid, however, to the intertwined relationship between Liu's political authoritarianism and his meditation on religion. This article traces Liu's lifelong search for a “religious consciousness” from his youthful yearnings for Christian redemption in the 1980s “New Enlightenment,” to the utter profanation of the sacred in his recent espousal of the Mao cult. I suggest that Liu's conservative turn should not obscure the profound and troubling continuity between his earlier search for an “otherworldly” religious ethics and his later obsession with “this-worldly” political theology. By exploring the entanglement between revolution and religion throughout Liu's zigzagging journey, this article considers Liu's transition as part and parcel of a generational endeavor to come to terms with the “politico-theological” legacies of Mao's revolution.","[{""name"": ""Hang Tu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2504188"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300204216.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.histeuroideas.2010.11.009"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511984754"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790454"", ""10.1177/0090591794022004004"", ""10.1163/9789047427988"", ""10.1515/9781400827213"", ""10.1080/10971467.2018.1549352"", ""10.1017/9781108367783"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300204216.001.0001"", ""10.3726/978-3-653-00165-5"", ""10.1017/9781108164610"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226230979.001.0001"", ""10.1215/00161071-1424983"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8675.2009.00523.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1p9wrd2.8"", ""10.1163/9789004243781"", ""10.1177/0090591792020003004""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The focusing principle is a restriction of the proof-search space that can capture various goal-directed proof-search procedures. In this paper we show that focused proof-search is complete for BI by first reformulating the traditional bunched sequent calculus using the simpler data-structure of nested sequents, following with a polarised and focused variant that we show is sound and complete via a cut-elimination argument. This establishes an operational semantics for focused proof-search in the logic of Bunched Implications.","[{""name"": ""Alexander Gheorghiu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sonia Marin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/logcom/2.3.297"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2010.08.012"", ""10.2168/LMCS-6(3:3)2010"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49630-5_23"", ""10.1007/11814771_9"", ""10.1016/j.apal.2011.09.003"", ""10.29007/ngp3"", ""10.1007/3-540-09510-1_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-32275-7_31"", ""10.1007/11780342_19"", ""10.1145/2503887.2503892"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198503811.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0960129505004858"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-29026-9_8"", ""10.1007/3-540-45500-0_13"", ""10.1007/3-540-45620-1_8"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(87)90045-4"", ""10.1145/1988042.1988050"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2009.07.041"", ""10.1016/0168-0072(92)90075-B"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-89439-1_12"", ""10.1016/0168-0072(91)90068-W"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2012.12.008"", ""10.2307/421090"", ""10.1145/3326938.3326940 10.1145/3326938.3326940"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-0091-7"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2003.11.020"", ""10.1145/3373718.3394802""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Divided between the colonial cantonment governed by the British and the petah or native market town/village governed by the Mysore prince, colonial medics were concerned by numerous diseases affecting the city. Attempts to control the flows of water from the cantonment to the native town proved futile. Amidst famine like conditions from the 1870s, chronic water shortages affected the city. In the 1890s, the plague struck Bangalore. The plague affected the barracks, streets, neighbourhoods and homes. Together, the diseases and water shortages led to new piped water schemes drawn from outside the city and wholesale changes in housing.

This applies to East Central European and to Italian history alike. A thought-provoking book, published in 1993, evoked the image of ‘an avalanche that swells downhill, speeded up and enriched by the great landslide of the nearby great mountain’. In this way the historian Luciano Cafagna described the impact of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Italian democracy. As a matter of fact, the Italian party system, based on the leading role of the Christian Democratic Party and of the West's major Communist Party, suddenly collapsed in the three years that followed the end of the Cold War because of a growing loss of legitimacy. In hindsight, though, I argue that the first, mostly invisible, movements of this ‘avalanche’ went further back in time, to well before 1989. The early 1990s simply marked its spectacular acceleration.","[{""name"": ""Marco Bresciani"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/497719"", ""10.1515/9780691187273"", ""10.1017/S0067237811000622""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Conditional model checking (CMC) is a successful solution for cooperation between verification tools. In CMC, the first verifier outputs a condition describing the state space that it successfully verified. The second verifier uses the condition to focus its verification on the unverified state space. To use arbitrary second verifiers, we recently proposed a reducer-based approach. One can use the reducer-based approach to construct a conditional verifier from a reducer and a (non-conditional) verifier: the reducer translates the condition into a residual program that describes the unverified state space and the verifier can be any off-the-shelf verifier (that does not need to understand conditions). Until now, only one reducer was available. But for a systematic investigation of the reducer concept, we need several reducers. To fill this gap, we developed FRed, a Framework for exploring different REDucers. Given an existing reducer, FRed allows us to derive various new reducers, which differ in their trade-off between size and precision of the residual program. For our experiments, we derived seven different reducers. Our evaluation on the largest and most diverse public collection of verification problems shows that we need all seven reducers to solve hard verification tasks that were not solvable before with the considered verifiers.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marie-Christine Jakobs"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-540-32275-7_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69166-2_16"", ""10.1145/1390630.1390634"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950351"", ""10.1145/2786805.2786867"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_16"", ""10.1145/2393596.2393664"", ""10.1109/ASE.2008.13"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16722-6_23"", ""10.5281/zenodo.3953565"", ""10.1145/3180155.3180259"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-37057-1_11"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1145/2245276.2231980"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-32759-9_13"", ""10.1145/2884781.2884843"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-53413-7_6"", ""10.1145/800028.808480"", ""10.1145/567752.567778"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-77505-8_23"", ""10.1145/1062455.1062533"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46675-9_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49122-5_16"", ""10.1007/11804192_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_32"", ""10.1109/TCAD.2008.923410"", ""10.1145/3106237.3106249"", ""10.1145/1081706.1081742"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_15"", ""10.1145/1985793.1985971"", ""10.1145/1706299.1706307"", ""10.1145/1181775.1181790"", ""10.1145/1542476.1542518"", ""10.1007/3-540-45657-0_45"", ""10.1145/567446.567454"", ""10.1145/2632362.2632372"", ""10.1145/3014427"", ""10.1145/1138912.1138916"", ""10.1145/2338965.2336789"", ""10.1145/263699.263712"", ""10.1145/503272.503286"", ""10.1109/ASE.2008.29"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_57"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_15"", ""10.1007/3-540-61739-6_31"", ""10.1145/1356058.1356066"", ""10.1145/318593.318659"", ""10.1109/DSN.2009.5270355""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

This paper considers the unintended institutional consequences of these loans. The novel devices allowed (1) the holders of forced-loan coupons to use these bonds to pay off debts incurred in customs duties and (2) the holders of bills of exchange involved in the provisioning of the military to use these bills to pay part of their forced loans. Starting with the conceptualisation of the institutional order as a complex system, this paper examines the interactions among the circulation of financial paper bills, the financing of war and changes in the position of the merchants' guild and the legal framework for Atlantic trade. It thereby contributes to renewing institutional change approaches in the Spanish-American context.","[{""name"": ""Zacarias Moutoukias"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marjolein ’T Hart"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S096856501800001X"", ""10.3406/ahess.1992.279084"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139004237.022"", ""10.2307/3466184"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511759826"", ""10.4000/books.cvz.4307"", ""10.4000/books.cvz.15967"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511551024"", ""10.4000/books.cvz.4346"", ""10.1215/9780822394006"", ""10.1515/9781503622500"", ""10.1215/00182168-2007-118"", ""10.1017/S1740022806000076"", ""10.1353/book.3370"", ""10.1086/378454"", ""10.4000/books.cvz.4324"", ""10.1080/10609164.2011.552550"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00581.x"", ""10.2307/3466498"", ""10.1515/9780804764148"", ""10.1215/00182168-71.1.35"", ""10.1525/california/9780520285156.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0023879100034701"", ""10.1215/00182168-2010-001"", ""10.1017/S1740022806000155"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107338661"", ""10.4000/books.cvz.4339"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300092530.001.0001"", ""10.3989/aeamer.2007.v64.i1.39"", ""10.1177/0096144205281626"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004188914.i-342"", ""10.1017/S0212610900000744"", ""10.2307/1007310"", ""10.1215/00182168-64.2.287"", ""10.56451/10334/3790"", ""10.1215/00182168-2007-117""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Cultural Studies', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Though state factories were presented and celebrated as model institutions of national modernity, their operations were characterized from the outset by serious and chronic problems of inefficiency and low productivity. To secure technical and managerial know-how on the shop floor, the Turkish state approached knowledgeable German industrial managers to organize its industrial production rationally, hoping to take advantage of the increasingly repressive political climate in Germany, which was driving leading experts into exile.

In this paper, we present some of the more well-known programming models to program for current and future GPU systems. We then measure the performance of each approach using a benchmark and a mini-app, test with various compilers, and tune the codes where necessary. Finally, we compare the performance, where possible, between the NVIDIA Volta (V100), Ampere (A100) GPUs, and the AMD MI100 GPU.","[{""name"": ""George S.

10.1017/S0009640721002158,CHURCH HISTORY,0603 World History; 0101 Philosophy,"Eusebius of Caesarea, the Roman Empire, and the Fulfillment of Biblical Prophecy: Reassessing Byzantine Imperial Eschatology in the Age of Constantine","AbstractModern scholarship often attributes to Eusebius of Caesarea (d. circa 340 AD) the view that God's heavenly kingdom had become manifest in the Roman Empire of Constantine the Great. Consequently, Eusebius is deemed significant in the development of Christian eschatological thought as the supposed formulator of a new “realized eschatology” for the Christian Roman Empire. Similarly, he is considered the originator of so-called “Byzantine imperial eschatology”—that is, eschatology designed to justify the existing imperial order under the emperors in Constantinople. Scholars advancing these claims most frequently cite a line from Eusebius's Tricennial Oration in which he identified the accession of the sons of Constantine with the prophesied kingdom of the saints in the Book of Daniel. Further supposed evidence has been adduced in his other writings, especially his Life of Constantine. This article argues that this common interpretation of Eusebius's eschatology is mistaken and has resulted from treating a few passages in isolation while overlooking their rhetorical context. It demonstrates instead that Eusebius adhered to a conventional Christian eschatology centered on the future kingdom of heaven that would accompany the second coming of Christ and further suggests that the concept of “Byzantine imperial eschatology” should be reconsidered.","[{""name"": ""Christopher Bonura"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/004056394600700202"", ""10.1017/S0017816000020678""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Archeology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Classics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6825), ('0602 中国史', 0.6817)]]"
10.1017/S1740022820000030,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Environmental factors in trade during the great transformation: advancing the geographical coverage before 1950,"AbstractIn the study of trade-embedded environmental factors (land, water, energy, or material flows), three conflicting interpretations prevail concerning what happened before 1950. The ‘great specialization’ narrative argues that trade served to lighten pressure on the environment by redistributing environmental services from where they were abundant to where they were scarce. The ‘great divergence’ sees an exploitative transfer from poor countries to rich and powerful ones or an environmental load displacement from rich to poor. The ‘great acceleration’ dismisses flows as insignificant either way. We review long-term national studies and find an almost exclusive focus on developed countries, mostly European and especially the UK, where more systematic studies tend to support ‘specialization’ and/or ‘acceleration’. By contrast, more qualitative studies on individual exports from developing countries often support ‘divergence’, but, since imports are excluded by design, this can never be demonstrated. We propose widening the geographical scope of long-term national studies beyond Europe and extending existing studies with bilateral trade, and suggest that ‘developing country’ trade be quantified according to existing methods of environmental accounting.","[{""name"": ""John Brolin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Astrid Kander"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Yet, constructing specifications for the full proof relies on domain expertise and non-trivial manpower. In view of such needs, an automated approach for specification synthesis is desired. While existing automated approaches are limited in their versatility,i.e., they either focus only on synthesizing loop invariants for numerical programs, or are tailored for specific types of programs or invariants. Programs involving multiple complicated data types (e.g., arrays, pointers) and code structures (e.g., nested loops, function calls) are often beyond their capabilities. To help bridge this gap, we presentAutoSpec, an automated approach to synthesize specifications for automated program verification. It overcomes the shortcomings of existing work in specification versatility, synthesizing satisfiable and adequate specifications for full proof. It is driven by static analysis and program verification, and is empowered by large language models (LLMs).AutoSpecaddresses the practical challenges in three ways: (1) drivingAutoSpecby static analysis and program verification, LLMs serve as generators to generate candidate specifications, (2) programs are decomposed to direct the attention of LLMs, and (3) candidate specifications are validated in each round to avoid error accumulation during the interaction with LLMs. In this way,AutoSpeccan incrementally and iteratively generate satisfiable and adequate specifications. The evaluation shows its effectiveness and usefulness, as it outperforms existing works by successfully verifying 79% of programs through automatic specification synthesis, a significant improvement of 1.592x. It can also be successfully applied to verify the programs in a real-world X509-parser project.","[{""name"": ""Cheng Wen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jialun Cao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jie Su"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhiwu Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shengchao Qin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mengda He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Haokun Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shing-Chi Cheung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cong Tian"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-91908-9_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03421-4_15"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.187.3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-19458-5_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-09099-3_12"", ""10.1145/2544173.2509511"", ""10.1109/TASE52547.2021.00030"", ""10.1145/3597926.3598047"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-35873-9_10"", ""10.1145/2980983.2908099"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-77505-8_26"", ""10.1145/3183440.3195096"", ""10.1145/3183440.3194986"", ""10.1145/3385412.3385986"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02658-4_48"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_4"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_20"", ""10.1145/2737924.2737993"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_15"", ""10.1162/tacl_a_00638"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46520-3_30"", ""10.1145/2509136.2509511"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-20652-9_6"", ""10.1007/s00165-014-0326-7"", ""10.1145/3597926.3598135"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-37703-7_18"", ""10.1145/3368089.3409716"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-44429-7_2"", ""10.1145/1993498.1993524"", ""10.1145/1281192.1281243"", ""10.1145/3213846.3213876"", ""10.1145/3424307"", ""10.1145/565816.503275"", ""10.1145/1134285.1134325"", ""10.1145/566172.566213"", ""10.1145/1273442.1250749"", ""10.1145/1273463.1273487"", ""10.1109/ASE.2017.8115690"", ""10.1145/3510003.3510120"", ""10.1145/3695988"", ""10.1145/3597926.3598067"", ""10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00085"", ""10.1145/3653718"", ""10.1145/3611643.3613078"", ""10.1145/3611643.3616243"", ""10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00194"", ""10.1109/SP46215.2023.10179324"", ""10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00129"", ""10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00128"", ""10.1145/3368089.3409686""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

Reconstructing cardiac anatomy in 3D can enable discovery of new biomarkers and make imaging less dependent on operator expertise, however most ultrasound systems only have 2D imaging capabilities. We propose both a simple alteration to the Pix2Vox++ networks for a sizeable reduction in memory usage and computational complexity, and a pipeline to perform reconstruction of 3D anatomy from 2D standard cardiac views, effectively enabling 3D anatomical reconstruction from limited 2D data. We evaluate our pipeline using synthetically generated data achieving accurate 3D whole-heart reconstructions (peak intersection over union score $$&gt; 0.88$$ &gt; 0.88 ) from just two standard anatomical 2D views of the heart.

The issues of primary concern here are the extent to which lateral, inter-regional relations in the Iberian worlds dominated vertical relations connecting particular areas to Madrid or Lisbon; how power and agency on local scales may be integrated into accounts of flows and interactions on larger scales; the ways in which the history of the Iberian empires through a global prism breaks with pre-existing nationalistic narratives; and whether or not the decentralized component of these empires was unique to them. Finally, examples are detailed of how Iberian imperial history can provide a fruitful basis for a polycentric history of globalization. The examples given take heart from critical engagement with the Great Divergence paradigm, the new analytical potentialities of global ecological history, the constructive and destructive impact of globalization upon empires, and the importance of studying the history of empires comparatively.","[{""name"": ""Bartolomé Yun-Casalilla"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for efficiently semi-deciding the reachability problem for Petri nets in practice. Our key insight is that computationally lightweight over-approximations of Petri nets can be used as distance oracles in classical graph exploration algorithms such as $$\mathsf {A}^{*}$$ A ∗ and greedy best-first search. We provide and evaluate a prototype implementation of our approach that outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools, sometimes by orders of magnitude, and which is also competitive with domain-specific tools on benchmarks coming from program synthesis and concurrent program analysis.","[{""name"": ""Michael Blondin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christoph Haase"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Philip Offtermatt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/LICS.1996.561359"", ""10.1016/j.mbs.2007.07.003"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(76)90067-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-40229-1_35"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_5"", ""10.1109/CSF.2007.26"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_14"", ""10.1145/3105908"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.CONCUR.2018.14"", ""10.6084/m9.figshare.13573592"", ""10.1093/bib/bbm029"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2016.06.017"", ""10.1145/3313276.3316369"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-10669-9"", ""10.1007/3-540-46002-0_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38856-9_24"", ""10.1007/BFb0055044"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-00431-5_5"", ""10.1007/3-540-65306-6_20"", ""10.1007/s00236-016-0272-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_40"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009851"", ""10.3233/FI-2015-1168"", ""10.1145/2568225.2568250"", ""10.1145/2568225.2568250"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2018.04.014"", ""10.1145/146637.146681"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17127-8_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-68894-5_7"", ""10.1109/LICS.2017.8005065"", ""10.1023/A:1008097430956"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(77)90014-7"", ""10.1145/2629608"", ""10.1145/800070.802201"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(92)90173-D"", ""10.1109/70.282537"", ""10.1109/LICS.2015.16"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2950232"", ""10.1145/800076.802477"", ""10.1016/S0278-6125(05)80009-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1109/5.24143"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(78)90036-1"", ""10.1007/3-540-44988-4_27"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25543-5_7"", ""10.1016/0950-7051(93)90042-R"", ""10.1142/S0218126698000043"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-57861-3_19"", ""10.1142/S0218843009002002"", ""10.1145/277044.277201"", ""10.1016/j.cl.2004.02.006""]","['Computer Science', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management Information Systems', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)]]"

One subset of the field focuses on democratic nation building, seeking to answer questions of how people can live together in divided societies and presenting institutional recommendations. The other subset examines autocratic nation building, or how those in power utilize nation building to maintain their position of dominance. Scholars examine both types of nation building from above, examining government policies and elite action, and from below, analyzing the practices and emotions of non-elites. While there has been much progress in the field of nation-building studies, I suggest that we focus more on the conceptual differences between democratic and autocratic nation building, address the interactions of elites and non-elites in nation-building practices, and disaggregate analyses to take into account in-country variation in nation building.","[{""name"": ""Katie L.

However, constructing inference implementations that are efficient enough is challenging for many real-world problems. Often, this is due to PPLs not fully exploiting available parallelization and optimization opportunities. For example, handling probabilistic checkpoints in PPLs through continuation-passing style transformations or non-preemptive multitasking—as is done in many popular PPLs—often disallows compilation to low-level languages required for high-performance platforms such as GPUs. To solve the checkpoint problem, we introduce the concept of PPL control-flow graphs (PCFGs)—a simple and efficient approach to checkpoints in low-level languages. We use this approach to implement RootPPL: a low-level PPL built on CUDA and C++ with OpenMP, providing highly efficient and massively parallel SMC inference. We also introduce a general method of compiling universal high-level PPLs to PCFGs and illustrate its application when compiling Miking CorePPL—a high-level universal PPL—to RootPPL. The approach is the first to compile a universal PPL to GPUs with SMC inference. We evaluate RootPPL and the CorePPL compiler through a set of real-world experiments in the domains of phylogenetics and epidemiology, demonstrating up to 6$$\times $$ × speedups over state-of-the-art PPLs implementing SMC inference.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Lundén"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joey Öhman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Kudlicka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Viktor Senderov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fredrik Ronquist"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Broman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511609619"", ""10.1145/3315508.3329974"", ""10.1145/3357766.3359531"", ""10.18637/jss.v076.i01"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314642"", ""10.1007/978-1-4757-3437-9"", ""10.1145/155090.155113"", ""10.1371/journal.pntd.0005173"", ""10.1201/b14835"", ""10.1145/2593882.2593900"", ""10.1145/3062341.3062375"", ""10.1038/nature11631"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72019-3_15"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5914164"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99336-8_2"", ""10.1080/10618600.2015.1062015"", ""10.1016/j.arcontrol.2018.10.013"", ""10.1561/9781680836332"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-29604-3_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-03811-6"", ""10.1038/s42003-021-01753-7"", ""10.1145/3064899.3064910"", ""10.1561/2200000001""]",['Computer Science'],['Artificial Intelligence'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

One design decision in knowledge graph deployment is choosing a representation that optimally supports the application’s consumers. Currently, however, there is no consensus on which representations best support each consumer scenario. In this work, we analyze the fitness of popular knowledge graph representations for three consumer scenarios: knowledge exploration, systematic querying, and graph completion. We compare the accessibility for knowledge exploration through a user study with dedicated browsing interfaces and query endpoints. We assess systematic querying with SPARQL in terms of time and query complexity on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We measure the impact of various representations on the popular graph completion task by training graph embedding models per representation. We experiment with four representations: Standard Reification, N-Ary Relationships, Wikidata qualifiers, and RDF-star. We find that Qualifiers and RDF-star are better suited to support use cases of knowledge exploration and systematic querying, while Standard Reification models perform most consistently for embedding model inference tasks but may become cumbersome for users. With this study, we aim to provide novel insights into the relevance of the representation choice and its impact on common knowledge graph consumption scenarios.","[{""name"": ""Ana Iglesias-Molina"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kian Ahrabian"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Filip Ilievski"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jay Pujara"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oscar Corcho"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1371/journal.pone.0144578"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2993117"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11964-9_4"", ""10.1145/3183713.3190657"", ""10.3233/SW-180307"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-35843-2_8"", ""10.2200/S01045ED1V01Y202009AIM046"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46547-0_10"", ""10.3233/SW-190387"", ""10.1145/3447772"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7443836"", ""10.5281/zenodo.8179156"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-62466-8_18"", ""10.1109/MIC.2014.124"", ""10.1145/2566486.2567973"", ""10.1109/ICSC50631.2021.00049"", ""10.1145/3534678.3539405"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-13818-8_32"", ""10.1145/2629489"", ""10.18653/v1/P16-2033"", ""10.1145/3397271.3401172""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

A thorough analysis of three spheres of Dutch bureaucracy (reporting, registering, and litigating) makes it clear that there was no uniform ideology that steered categorisation practices top-down throughout the studied colonial institutions. Rather, the rationale of the organisation as such affected the way people were classified, depending to a large extent on what level of bureaucracy individuals were dealing with, and what the possible negotiation strategies were for the people recorded. Future research should perhaps not ask “when” certain ethnicities were “made up,” but strive to understand the process in which they were created, the institutional contexts in which they were recorded, and how changing bureaucratic practices not only articulated, but also transformed, social categories in the long run.","[{""name"": ""Dries Lyna"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luc Bulten"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctt1qnw8bs.14"", ""10.1163/9789004254855"", ""10.18352/bmgn-lchr.10684"", ""10.1017/S0165115318000311"", ""10.1017/S0026749X03001197"", ""10.1093/0199270570.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0021911819000159"", ""10.3917/adh.135.0051"", ""10.2307/2059524"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00012300"", ""10.15847/cehc.prlteoe.945X015"", ""10.1111/j.1478-0542.2004.00094.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139057554"", ""10.24415/9789087283445"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004156029.i-272"", ""10.7312/wick19762"", ""10.1080/2049677X.2019.1613308"", ""10.1017/S0026749X03001136"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1qnw8bs"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521264341"", ""10.5871/bacad/9780197265314.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2058432"", ""10.1057/9780230360075_9"", ""10.1017/9781108648189"", ""10.1017/S0010417500019927"", ""10.1016/j.hisfam.2011.08.006"", ""10.1177/006996679803200213"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2451.2006.00613.x"", ""10.1086/ahr.115.2.428"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004165083.i-294"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199259885.003.0005"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226038360.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Despite the rise of nationalism in salience throughout Chinese society, studies of nationalism in China are frequently tagged as insularly focused and unsuitable for comparison. However, a survey of the literature in Chinese nationalism studies reveals that similar blind spots and limitations challenge studies of China with more general comparative research on nationalism. Given this parallelism in development, I argue that looking to observations of China provides scholars of nationalism with vital opportunities to expand and refine theory to include insights from a non-western, non-democratic case.","[{""name"": ""David R.

The article argues that a state-driven mobilization of relief and rehabilitation was organized to alleviate the plight of refugee children. It points particularly to children's health care and the organization of education as instances that marked a shift in the scope of refugee camps in wartime Austria-Hungary. At first, camps represented a temporary measure to immobilize and control displaced populations. As the war progressed, they became a permanent feature of refugee policy and a microcosm of agendas of state consolidation. Ultimately, the case of child assistance shows that the organization of refugee camps in wartime Austria-Hungary was a fluid and gradual process that meshed technologies of population containment with humanitarian and welfare practices.","[{""name"": ""Doina Anca Cretu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1146/annurev.an.24.100195.002431"", ""10.1017/S0067237800016349"", ""10.1086/675880"", ""10.1017/S0067237813000659"", ""10.2307/j.ctv29sfz5s"", ""10.1086/716903"", ""10.7591/9780801461910"", ""10.2307/j.ctvs1g9cp""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Static analyzers that guarantee data-race freedom (DRF) are essential to help programmers establish the correctness of their programs (kernels). However, existing approaches produce too many false alarms and struggle to handle larger programs. To address these limitations we formalize a novel compositional analysis for DRF, based on access memory protocols. These protocols are behavioral types that codify the way threads interact over shared memory.Our work includes fully mechanized proofs of our theoretical results, the first mechanized proofs in the field of DRF analysis for GPU kernels.

To increase the reliability of verification results, many verifiers now accompany their answers by witnesses in an interoperable standard format. There exist witness validators that can examine the witnesses and potentially confirm the verification results. This case study analyzes the quality of existing witness validators for C programs using the witnesses produced by a wide variety of 40 verification tools that participated in SV-COMP 2022. In particular, we show that many witness validators sometimes confirm witnesses that are invalid. To remedy this situation, we suggest some advances in witness validation, including a regular comparative evaluation of validators. Our suggestions were recently adopted by the SV-COMP community for the next edition of the competition.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Strejček"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_33"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_43"", ""10.1109/MSR.2019.00026"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950351"", ""10.1145/3477579"", ""10.1145/2786805.2786867"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92994-1_1"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_36"", ""10.26226/morressier.604907f51a80aac83ca25d83""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

10.1017/S1053837222000116,JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF ECONOMIC THOUGHT,0603 World History,"COBWEB THEORY, MARKET STABILITY, AND PRICE EXPECTATIONS","Contributors to cobweb theory include many leading economists of the twentieth century. From early beginnings in 1930, cobweb theory played a key role in evolving perceptions of market stability arising from recursive linear models with endogenous dynamics. The focal point of this evolution in cobweb theory is the transition from naive to adaptive to rational price expectations. After a review of the prehistory, this paper examines the first wave of linear cobweb theory initiated by Jan Tinbergen, Henry Schultz, and Umberto Ricci and proceeds to consider the evolution of price expectations in the second wave of cobweb models associated with endogenous cycles in commodity markets. The role of modern cobweb theory in discussions about the stability of market equilibrium and the connection to processes with rational expectations is assessed.","[{""name"": ""Geoffrey Poitras"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1231011"", ""10.2307/2548676"", ""10.2307/1233281"", ""10.2307/2226943"", ""10.2307/1880597"", ""10.2307/1239345"", ""10.1016/j.econmod.2018.02.012"", ""10.2307/1911284"", ""10.2307/1906882"", ""10.1093/ajae/aaq014"", ""10.2307/2967618"", ""10.1215/00182702-15-4-567"", ""10.1007/BF02071050"", ""10.2307/2967631"", ""10.1215/00182702-22-4-587"", ""10.1017/S1053837217000116"", ""10.1002/sdr.1565"", ""10.1007/BF01316460"", ""10.2307/2227209"", ""10.2307/1236542"", ""10.1086/259632"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6419.2010.00634.x"", ""10.2307/1241690"", ""10.2307/1884209"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-90310-7"", ""10.2307/1236289"", ""10.4000/oeconomia.325"", ""10.1007/BF01320052"", ""10.2307/1882736"", ""10.2307/2109550"", ""10.1017/S1053837219000518"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8276.2006.00849.x"", ""10.2307/1234771"", ""10.1080/09672560902891051"", ""10.1016/j.jedc.2015.01.003"", ""10.2307/2229630"", ""10.2307/1882301"", ""10.2307/1229848"", ""10.1086/255343"", ""10.1016/0167-2681(95)00082-8"", ""10.2307/1230103"", ""10.2307/1883501"", ""10.1215/00182702-33-4-773"", ""10.1080/09672560802480971"", ""10.2307/2226643"", ""10.1215/00182702-16-1-69"", ""10.1093/erae/jbt017"", ""10.2307/1234389"", ""10.2307/2526061"", ""10.2307/1909635"", ""10.2307/1884208"", ""10.1215/00182702-34-2-291"", ""10.2307/1905478"", ""10.1007/BF01318500"", ""10.2307/1234772"", ""10.1007/BF01311526"", ""10.2307/1882433"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511522109"", ""10.1002/for.936"", ""10.2307/1879606"", ""10.1017/9781108856546"", ""10.2307/1236509"", ""10.2307/1907286"", ""10.2307/1882157"", ""10.2307/1055112"", ""10.2307/1881734"", ""10.2307/2956696"", ""10.1007/BF01318499""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Recent commentators have viewed Chen's text as a key elaboration of Chinese imperial discourse and its various tropes of hierarchical difference. In contrast, I argue that Chen reads the perceived cultural differences between his society and Taiwan's indigenous peoples as evidence of the contingency, rather than inevitable superiority, of a historical story that produces the outcome of ‘civilization’. Building on a broader understanding of Chen's intellectual biography and his extant works, I show that Chen Di places the indigenes along a different timeline in which they forge their own contingent history parallel to, rather than behind, that of a civilizational centre. By doing so, Chen's historical narrative resists aligning their society with Han Chinese forms of development and offers a glimpse of how late Ming syncretic thought could produce an account of legitimate otherness.","[{""name"": ""LEIGH K.

10.1017/S1479244320000025,MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY,0603 World History,"Building, Dwelling, Dying: Architecture and History in Pakistan","AbstractThere is a long history of scholars finding in architecture tools for thinking, whether this is the relationship between nature and culture in Simmel's ruins, industrial capitalism in Benjamin's Parisian arcades, or the rhythms of the primordial in Heidegger's Black Forest farmhouse. But what does it mean to take seriously the concepts and dispositions articulated by architects themselves? How might processes of designing and making constitute particular forms of thinking? This article considers the words and buildings of Lahore-based architect Kamil Khan Mumtaz (b. 1939) as an entry point into such questions. It outlines how professional architecture in Pakistan has grappled with the unsettled status of the past in a country forged out of two partitions (1947 and 1971). Mumtaz's work and thought—engaging questions of tradition, authority, craft and the sacred—demonstrates how these predicaments have been productive for conceptualizing time, labor and the nature of dwelling in a postcolonial world.","[{""name"": ""Chris Moffat"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/3848614"", ""10.1057/9780230623231"", ""10.4000/ejas.12359"", ""10.1515/9781400823062"", ""10.4324/9780203934197"", ""10.2307/j.ctt21pxkvh"", ""10.1177/0032321717722363"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226331898.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020743800061596"", ""10.2307/j.ctvgd34n"", ""10.1111/1467-9655.12103"", ""10.5040/9781474214179"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674074163"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107298033"", ""10.1177/1474885116666795"", ""10.1017/9781316711224"", ""10.1080/13602360903357120"", ""10.1016/0197-3975(83)90085-1"", ""10.2307/j.ctvfc52h3""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Among the solutions proposed is to support human analysts by thematically grouping the contributions through automated means. While supervised machine learning would naturally lend itself to the task of classifying citizens’ proposal according to certain predefined topics, the amount of training data required is often prohibitive given the idiosyncratic nature of most public participation processes. One potential solution to minimise the amount of training data is the use of active learning. While this semi-supervised procedure has proliferated in recent years, these promising approaches have never been applied to the evaluation of participation contributions. Therefore we utilise data from online participation processes in three German cities, provide classification baselines and subsequently assess how different active learning strategies can reduce manual labelling efforts while maintaining a good model performance. Our results show not only that supervised machine learning models can reliably classify topic categories for public participation contributions, but that active learning significantly reduces the amount of training data required. This has important implications for the practice of public participation because it dramatically cuts the time required for evaluation from which in particular processes with a larger number of contributions benefit.","[{""name"": ""Julia Romberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tobias Escher"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/2994310.2994366"", ""10.1145/3452118"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-27325-5_18"", ""10.1080/10967494.2018.1488780"", ""10.1126/science.aaw2694"", ""10.18653/v1/2020.emnlp-main.638"", ""10.1016/j.ipm.2018.05.006"", ""10.1109/HICSS.2015.257"", ""10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563068"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2020.102941"", ""10.1145/1146598.1146649"", ""10.1177/0894439313506847"", ""10.1016/j.ipm.2015.10.004"", ""10.18653/v1/2021.emnlp-main.51"", ""10.1145/130385.130417"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2021.101590"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-03781-8_13""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

However, it is common for HPC systems to primarily assign resources on a per-node basis to prevent interference from co-located workloads. This gap between the coarse-grained resource allocation and the varying resource demands can lead to HPC resources being not fully utilized. In this study, we analyze the resource usage and application behavior of NERSC’s Perlmutter, a state-of-the-art open-science HPC system with both CPU-only and GPU-accelerated nodes. Our one-month usage analysis reveals that CPUs are commonly not fully utilized, especially for GPU-enabled jobs. Also, around 64% of both CPU and GPU-enabled jobs used 50% or less of the available host memory capacity. Additionally, about 50% of GPU-enabled jobs used up to 25% of the GPU memory, and the memory capacity was not fully utilized in some ways for all jobs. While our study comes early in Perlmutter’s lifetime thus policies and application workload may change, it provides valuable insights on performance characterization, application behavior, and motivates systems with more fine-grain resource allocation.","[{""name"": ""Jie Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""George Michelogiannakis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Brandon Cook"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dulanya Cooray"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yong Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/SC.2014.18"", ""10.1109/CCGRID.2017.18"", ""10.1126/science.1259439"", ""10.1145/3126908.3126937"", ""10.1145/3126908.3126917"", ""10.1109/MCSE.2011.52"", ""10.1109/CLUSTER49012.2020.00022"", ""10.1109/NAS.2017.8026844"", ""10.1145/3514245"", ""10.1109/DSN.2007.103"", ""10.1145/3352460.3358267"", ""10.1145/3295500.3356183"", ""10.1145/3488423.3519336"", ""10.1109/SBAC-PAD49847.2020.00034"", ""10.25080/majora-1b6fd038-010"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-72971-8_13"", ""10.1109/CLUSTER.2019.8891001"", ""10.1145/3078597.3078614"", ""10.1109/IPDPS.2011.83""]",['Computer Science'],"['Hardware and Architecture', 'Information Systems', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

Physical exercise is considered important for people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) to slow down disease progression and maintain abilities and quality of life. However, people with PD often experience barriers to exercises that causes low-level adherence to exercise plans and programs. Virtual Reality (VR) is an innovative and promising technology for motor and cognitive rehabilitation. Immersive VR exergames have potential advantages by allowing for individualized skill practice in a motivating interactive environment without distractions from outside events. This paper presents an immersive virtual reality (VR) exergame aiming at motor training on fingers and hand-and-eye coordination. The results from the usability study indicate that immersive VR exergames have potential to provide motivating and engaging physical exercise for people with PD.

Unfortunately, this positive tendency is marred by various age-related health issues, which people experience. Falling is one of the most serious and common of them. Falls negatively influences elderly’ everyday living and significantly decreases quality of their life. Physical exercises is a proven method for preventing falls. However, it is only effective when training is regular and exercise techniques are correct. This paper presents a prototype of an augmented reality exergame for elderly people to perform physical exercise at home. The research is focusing on developing a solution for both above-mentioned issues: augmentation with Microsoft Kinect and various sensors assists in creating a safe game environment, which can helps to perform exercises with right technique; gamification elements contribute to users’ motivation to train regularly. A user-centered design approach was adopted to guide the design and development iterative process. User testing of the first prototype was performed and demonstrated positive attitudes from participants. Feedback from user testing will be used for the next development iterations.","[{""name"": ""Anna Nishchyk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wim Geentjens"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alejandro Medina"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marie Klein"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Weiqin Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/VAAT.2014.6799464"", ""10.1145/2413097.2413136"", ""10.1002/14651858.CD007146.pub3"", ""10.1186/1471-2318-14-15"", ""10.1093/ageing/afi218"", ""10.1145/2875194.2875206"", ""10.2147/NDT.S97809"", ""10.1145/2996267.2996268"", ""10.1186/1471-2377-13-15"", ""10.1145/2513002.2513026"", ""10.20870/IJVR.2010.9.2.2767"", ""10.1123/japa.21.1.71""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

Focusing in the first instance on the compilers of vernacular pharmacopoeia – compilations of medical ingredients and techniques – the article argues that just as sugar, tobacco, and especially opiates had a significant and possibly transformative role in everyday physic, so the ‘operation’ of opiates, distilled spirits, and tobacco was crucial in stimulating new thinking about how bodies became substance-dependent. The article also argues, however, that, in order to conceptualize the problem, writers turned to the venerable language of custom rather than the relatively new language of addiction – in particular, the ancient idea of custom as ‘second nature’.","[{""name"": ""Phil Withington"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/jsh/shv091"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtt027"", ""10.1111/rest.12328"", ""10.1111/ehr.12660"", ""10.1111/j.1360-0443.1985.tb03010.x"", ""10.1353/bhm.2019.0000"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00391.x"", ""10.15288/jsa.1978.39.143"", ""10.15288/jsa.1994.55.685""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

10.1017/S0018246X1900058X,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,"ANXIETY, CHAOS, AND THE RAJ","Chaos reigns – at least in the historiography of the Raj. It was once the consensus among historians that British imperial authority in the Indian subcontinent was secure for at least the century-and-a-half before the Second World War. Recently, however, this narrative has drawn a range of challenges. Prominently, Mark Condos and Jon Wilson have held that British imperial authority was chronicallyinsecure. In their view, the irrational anxiety of generations of British officials produced a chaotic administration with minimal social purchase or ideological coherence. Instead of a confident state capable of acting as it chose, these historians have limned a psychologically embattled one incapable of acting except in the abstract, small scale, or short term. Their bold revision succeeds in dispelling the aura of indomitability that has often surrounded the Raj, and in directing attention to its overlooked discontents and weaknesses. Yet their characterization of the British regime asconstantlyandpervasivelyanxious is more an article of faith than a conclusion warranted by evidence. Nor do they explain how, if the regime suffered from permanent ‘chaos’ or ‘insecurity’, it managed to survive for some two hundred years. At the heart of Condos's and Wilson's approach is an effort to bypass texts that results, instead, in misreading them. It is largely by re-emphasizing rigorous textual methods, therefore, that Durba Ghosh offers a compelling alternative approach to the history of state vulnerability and disorder.","[{""name"": ""JOSHUA EHRLICH"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139878418"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139012140"", ""10.1215/0961754X-11-2-283"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198827375.001.0001"", ""10.1086/532498"", ""10.1057/9781137312891_10"", ""10.1017/S1479244306001016"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139525404.006"", ""10.1017/S1479244307001552"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00016061"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00009410"", ""10.4000/lhomme.29212"", ""10.2307/j.ctvcb5btz"", ""10.2307/27697958"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-45136-7"", ""10.1086/509149"", ""10.5790/hongkong/9789888208449.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521395472"", ""10.1057/9780230584396"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198202431.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

To obtain the best performance, a typical development process involves the manual or semi-automatic application of optimizations prior to compiling the code. To avoid the introduction of errors, we can augment GPU programs with (pre- and postcondition-style) annotations to capture functional properties. However, keeping these annotations correct when optimizing GPU programs is labor-intensive and error-prone.This paper introduces Alpinist, an annotation-aware GPU program optimizer. It applies frequently-used GPU optimizations, but besides transforming code, it also transforms the annotations. We evaluate Alpinist, in combination with the VerCors program verifier, to automatically optimize a collection of verified programs and reverify them.","[{""name"": ""Ömer Şakar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohsen Safari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marieke Huisman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anton Wijs"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/29873.29875"", ""10.1145/2858788.2688521"", ""10.1145/3197978"", ""10.1145/3373376.3378498"", ""10.1007/11804192_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-29737-3_22"", ""10.1145/2398857.2384625"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66845-1_7"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2014.03.013"", ""10.1145/1040305.1040327"", ""10.1007/3-540-44898-5_4"", ""10.1145/2692916.2555253"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-34188-5_18"", ""10.1007/s10009-020-00576-x"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00619-x"", ""10.1007/s11227-015-1483-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46081-8_17"", ""10.1109/InPar.2012.6339595"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-63461-2_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_28"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-384988-5.00008-5"", ""10.1145/3293883.3295712"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03418-4_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-09967-5_8"", ""10.1145/1111037.1111042"", ""10.1007/s10817-009-9155-4"", ""10.1145/1882291.1882320"", ""10.1145/2370036.2145844"", ""10.1109/MM.2008.31"", ""10.1109/DATE.2012.6176615"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49122-5_2"", ""10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470423"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99725-4_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-53413-7_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-67067-2_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17462-0_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72016-2_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49665-7_23"", ""10.1145/2499370.2462176"", ""10.1002/cpe.4053"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-64276-1_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-63461-2_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-88806-0_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-55754-6_10"", ""10.1364/OE.18.009955"", ""10.1109/PDP.2017.15"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28652-0_2"", ""10.1016/j.future.2013.09.003"", ""10.1109/SC.2014.21"", ""10.1109/GreenCom-CPSCom.2010.102"", ""10.1016/j.future.2018.08.004"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-32820-6_85"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41540-6_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-06200-6_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48989-6_42"", ""10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.300"", ""10.1109/ISISE.2009.60"", ""10.1145/1809028.1806606""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Hardware and Architecture', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

Much literature has focused especially on colonies, where institutions have been argued to facilitate severe exploitation. In the present study, we examine the return on investments in an Asian colony, British Malaya, from 1889 to 1969 for a large sample of companies. Our results suggest that the return on investments in Malaya might have been among the highest in the world during the period studied. Nevertheless, this finding fits badly with theories of imperial exploitation and can only to a limited extent be explained by a higher risk premium. Instead, we argue that the main driver of the very high return on investments in Malaya was rather the substantial rise in global market prices of the output of the two main sectors of the Malayan economy, rubber and tin. The way that the process of decolonization unfolded in Malaya did, furthermore, not lead to any major nationalization of foreign-held assets, and did thereby not disrupt the return on investment in the region in the same way as decolonization did to the return on investment in some other colonies.","[{""name"": ""Klas Rönnbäck"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oskar Broberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stefania Galli"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00472337685390611"", ""10.1111/j.1478-0542.2007.00497.x"", ""10.1007/s11698-015-0128-z"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00482.x"", ""10.1111/ehr.12423"", ""10.2307/621891"", ""10.1515/9781400829477"", ""10.1017/S0022463400019317"", ""10.1017/S0022463400013874"", ""10.1057/9780230389465"", ""10.1016/0014-4983(76)90010-3"", ""10.1016/0301-4207(77)90034-4"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(95)00121-R"", ""10.1111/ehr.12075"", ""10.1080/00076799000000094"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490428"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00000962"", ""10.1080/00076799700000099"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8446.2005.00133.x"", ""10.4324/9780203856611"", ""10.1017/S0022050702001651"", ""10.1038/srep28496"", ""10.1017/S002246340001643X"", ""10.1017/S0007680500036242"", ""10.1017/9781139814867"", ""10.1017/S0022463400016830"", ""10.1111/1467-8381.00023"", ""10.1057/9780230389137"", ""10.1080/00076799000000091"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199280612.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03066159208438489"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-19711-7"", ""10.2307/2231448"", ""10.2307/2648916"", ""10.1007/978-0-333-98377-5"", ""10.1080/03086534.2016.1160690"", ""10.1353/ras.2010.a381383"", ""10.1080/03086539408582927"", ""10.1017/S0022463400015198"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00170"", ""10.4324/9780203333020"", ""10.1017/S000768050000091X""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Two colonies of the New World stood out in this transformation, both employing African slave labor on a large scale: Suriname, owned by the Dutch, and Saint-Domingue, the main French colony in the Caribbean. However, Suriname’s growth was short-lived, and it was soon surpassed by the productive leap of Saint-Domingue. The article explores the divergent trajectories of these two colonies, focusing on the environmental conditions of the operation of coffee plantations. Rather than taking the specific combinations of land, labor, capital, and political power as an independent and locally determined set, the article examines how the coffee trajectories of Suriname and Saint-Domingue were mutually formative through the specific evolving relationships that each space had within the world-system.","[{""name"": ""Rafael de Bivar Marquese"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3406/outre.1982.2379"", ""10.1017/S0165115300021185"", ""10.1215/00182168-32.1.22"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511528958"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139050173"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511512193"", ""10.1163/9789004283350"", ""10.3406/outre.1985.2450"", ""10.1017/S0165115300021501"", ""10.1163/9789004615472"", ""10.1080/0144039X.2020.1860465"", ""10.1080/23801883.2017.1370233"", ""10.1093/pastj/gtl001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1bjc3q7"", ""10.5195/jwsr.2011.427"", ""10.4159/9780674034365"", ""10.1080/01440398508574899"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511563263"", ""10.1163/9789004610910"", ""10.5040/9781350048744"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818196""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The digitalization also affects the size and complexity of the infrastructure and therefore makes it more difficult to gain an overview in order to secure the entire power system from attackers. One method of how to gain an overview of possible vulnerabilities and security threats is to use threat modeling. In threat modeling, information regarding the vulnerabilities and possible attacks of power systems is required to create an accurate and useful model. There are several different sources for this information. In this paper we conduct a systematic literature review to find which information sources that have been used in power system threat modeling research. Six different information sources were found: expert knowledge, logs &amp; alerts, previous research, system’s state, vulnerability scoring &amp; databases, and vulnerability scanners.","[{""name"": ""Engla Ling"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Robert Lagerström"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mathias Ekstedt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/DSN.2008.4630105"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10329-7_3"", ""10.1109/CRIS.2010.5617494"", ""10.1109/TSG.2011.2160000"", ""10.1109/SEGE.2018.8499431"", ""10.3390/inventions4030053"", ""10.1016/j.cose.2015.09.009"", ""10.1109/PESGM.2018.8586312"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2899983"", ""10.1109/TSG.2019.2938203"", ""10.1109/TSG.2015.2424155"", ""10.1109/SmartGridComm.2019.8909818"", ""10.5220/0006103900380046"", ""10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007710"", ""10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486016"", ""10.1109/ITNEC.2017.8285053"", ""10.1109/EDOC.2019.00020"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48674-1_15"", ""10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309311"", ""10.1109/TDSC.2012.66"", ""10.1111/exsy.12039"", ""10.1109/TST.2014.6787363"", ""10.1109/TDSC.2016.2644614"", ""10.1109/ISGTEurope.2017.8260283"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99843-5_20"", ""10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2033930"", ""10.1016/j.cose.2009.10.001"", ""10.1109/ISCCSP.2012.6217858"", ""10.1109/SENSET.2017.8125032"", ""10.1016/j.cose.2017.06.010"", ""10.1145/3055386.3055390"", ""10.1109/SERVICES.2019.00022"", ""10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603218"", ""10.1109/PES.2007.385876"", ""10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2048028"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-41485-5_23"", ""10.1186/s42162-018-0010-x"", ""10.1109/ICSGCE.2018.8556775"", ""10.3390/electronics7100249"", ""10.1016/j.cose.2019.03.010"", ""10.1007/s40565-015-0145-8"", ""10.3390/fi11030063"", ""10.1109/EI2.2018.8582234"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2961517"", ""10.1109/TSG.2015.2396994"", ""10.1109/TSG.2016.2523515"", ""10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939397""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Information Systems', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

A quasi-automated social network analysis of 3390 valid comments in seven major international news outlets (Jan-June 2020), revealed how older adults were generally resourceful and able to cope with COVID-19 stress. For many in this technology-using sample, information and communication technologies (ICTs) were important for staying informed, busy, and connected, but they were not the primary resources for coping. Although teleconferencing tools were praised for facilitating new forms of intergenerational connection during the lockdowns, they were considered temporary and inadequate substitutes for connection to family. Importantly, older adults objected to uncritical and patronizing assumptions about their ability to deal with stress, and to the promotion of ICTs as the most important coping strategy. Our findings underline the necessity of a critical and media-ecological approach to studying the affordances of new ICTs for older adults, which considers changing needs and contextual preferences of aging populations in adoption of de-stressing technologies.","[{""name"": ""Najmeh Khalili-Mahani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kim Sawchuk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sasha Elbaz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shannon Hebblethwaite"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Janis Timm-Bottos"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3389/fpubh.2020.00305"", ""10.1016/s2589-7500(20)30162-x"", ""10.2196/21820"", ""10.7759/cureus.10453"", ""10.1093/heapro/daaa140"", ""10.3389/fmed.2019.00329"", ""10.2196/20186"", ""10.1515/nor-2017-0396"", ""10.3390/healthcare7030086"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-78108-8_12"", ""10.1515/nor-2017-0399"", ""10.1093/geront/gnv094"", ""10.1080/03036758.2021.1884098"", ""10.1007/s10433-021-00613-x"", ""10.1037/amp0000699"", ""10.1111/jgs.16508"", ""10.1093/geronb/gbaa128"", ""10.1093/geronb/gbaa148"", ""10.2196/13303"", ""10.2196/11485"", ""10.1037/h0093861"", ""10.1037/a0022711"", ""10.1007/s10618-011-0224-z"", ""10.1088/1742-5468/2008/10/p10008"", ""10.1109/tnse.2015.2391998"", ""10.1093/geronb/gbaa096"", ""10.1093/geronb/gbaa120"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.21753"", ""10.1007/s11469-020-00339-4"", ""10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.010"", ""10.1093/geront/gnaa126"", ""10.3390/ijerph17165711"", ""10.1080/01490400.2020.1773998"", ""10.5195/aa.2015.104"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-77685-5_28"", ""10.2196/20186"", ""10.1093/geront/gnaa170"", ""10.3390/healthcare7020060"", ""10.1186/s40327-018-0066-5"", ""10.1515/nor-2017-0399"", ""10.1093/ageing/afaa097"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-73820-8_11"", ""10.1080/03601277.2015.1050870"", ""10.1093/geront/9.4_Part_1.243"", ""10.3138/utq.90.2.05""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Demography', 'Health', 'Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7864), ('1011 护理学', 0.7585)]]"

This essay brings together new research to demonstrate their close connections. Many suffragists became active in the birth control movement just before and after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. The roots of suffrage arguments were deeply embedded in the same ideas that were foundational to the birth control movement: bodily freedom and notions of what constituted full and participatory citizenship. Beginning in the 1840s, women's rights reformers directly connected the vote to a broad range of economic and political issues, including the concept of self-ownership. Wide-ranging debates about individual autonomy remained present in women's rights rhetoric and were then repeated in the earliest arguments for legalizing birth control. The twentieth-century birth control movement, like the suffrage movement before it (which had largely focused only on achieving the vote for white women), would then grapple with competing goals of restrictive racist and eugenic arguments for contraception alongside the emphasis on achieving emancipation for all women.","[{""name"": ""Heather Munro Prescott"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lauren MacIvor Thompson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5149/9780807838716_Klepp"", ""10.2307/3346796"", ""10.1353/jer.2014.0003"", ""10.1515/9781400866366"", ""10.2307/25701240"", ""10.7312/werb17522"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195086928.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226703381.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199754236.001.0001"", ""10.1353/bhm.2015.0086"", ""10.9783/9780812201987"", ""10.2307/2568759"", ""10.1353/book.57194"", ""10.2307/1887867"", ""10.1017/S0738248011000952"", ""10.2307/2713338"", ""10.7591/9781501711428"", ""10.1017/9781316577165"", ""10.2307/845898"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469659329.001.0001"", ""10.5149/9780807888902_jones"", ""10.56021/9780801868481"", ""10.1525/9780520939318"", ""10.5149/9780807888568_rosen"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511583629"", ""10.1136/medhum-2017-011419"", ""10.9783/9780812205008"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226134758.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['History', 'Marketing', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The growth of the anarcho-syndicalist National Confederation of Labour (CNT) had awakened the spectre of social revolution among the city's conservative classes, and a broad constellation of reactionary forces lined up against it, the Sindicatos Libres (free trade unions) being the most formidable among them. Created in 1919 by Catholic workers, the Sindicatos Libres were able to capitalize on the exhaustion that had set in among certain working-class groups who had grown wary of reckless strike action. Using violence to fight back against the CNT, the Libres could claim 175,000 members by mid-1922. They mobilized the religious, corporatist, and regionalist sentiments harboured by sectors of the city's workforce and, by adopting a modern repertoire of action, they bypassed the traditional aversion to mass mobilization that had characterized the Catholic labour movement and Spanish conservative parties until then. In many ways, the ideology and tactics of the Libres adumbrated fascism, but their success was short-lived. In late 1922, an upswing in strike action and an abatement of state repression allowed the CNT to recover at the expense of the Libres. This article explores the rise and fall of an organization the study of which has been neglected, situating it in a European context of political polarization whereby the traditional right attempted to modernize its tactics and adapt them to a rising challenge from the revolutionary left. It will also serve as a window through which to examine the complex relationship between workers’ trade union affiliations and their political and cultural identity.","[{""name"": ""Arturo Zoffmann Rodriguez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juan Cristóbal Marinello Bonnefoy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/002200948201700401"", ""10.1093/fh/13.2.99"", ""10.1177/026569147900900104"", ""10.7591/9781501737121"", ""10.1177/0265691419863982""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Inter-Imperial History and Austria-Hungary in Ottoman Thought, 1867-1921","Historians often look for genealogies of nationalism in Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman imperial history. In this article, I use an inter-imperial framework to argue that the formative period of contemporary Eastern Mediterranean-European regionalism was the last five decades of these two empires. The diplomatic, economic and cultural relations between the two middle powers compose an alternative history to national narratives. I show that dualism (‘independence’ within empire) was an attractive imperial reform model for Ottoman Muslim intellectuals. I describe first a forgotten Egyptian-Ottoman dualist vision, and then I analyse the more well-known Arab-Turkish dualist plans up to 1921.","[{""name"": ""Adam Mestyan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4159/9780674969346"", ""10.1080/07075332.2012.675224"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139998222.004"", ""10.4159/9780674981096"", ""10.1017/9781108226813"", ""10.1080/13530194.2012.709702"", ""10.1093/past/137.1.48"", ""10.1215/1089201x-2007-002"", ""10.1353/cch.2015.0009"", ""10.5040/9780755692897"", ""10.1525/9780520917576"", ""10.2307/2168200"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2303.2006.00347.x"", ""10.1017/S0010417512000394"", ""10.1017/S006723780001479X"", ""10.1080/00263200802285278"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316584521"", ""10.1017/S0010417517000329"", ""10.1515/9780804792707"", ""10.1080/19448953.2016.1196039"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195387865.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511558764"", ""10.1080/00263206.2013.836496"", ""10.1080/03086534.2018.1506868"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511977190"", ""10.4324/9781315739984"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791444"", ""10.1017/S0067237818000188"", ""10.1017/9781139049221"", ""10.1515/9781400830800-005"", ""10.2307/j.ctvfc55kd"", ""10.1080/19448953.2016.1196041""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Ghidra, developed by the National Security Agency, is one of the most popular decompilers. It decompiles binaries to high P-Code, from which the final decompilation output in C code is generated. Ghidra allows users to work with P-Code, so users can analyze the intermediate representation directly. Several projects make use of this to build tools that perform verification, decompilation, taint analysis and emulation, to name a few. P-Code lacks a formal semantics, and its documentation is limited. It has a notoriously subtle semantics, which makes it hard to do any sort of analysis on P-Code. We show that P-Code, as-is, cannot be given an executable semantics. In this paper, we augment P-Code and define a complete, executable, formal semantics for it. This is done by looking at the documentation and the decompilation results of binaries with known source code. The development of a formal P-Code semantics uncovered several issues in Ghidra, P-Code, and the documentation. We show that these issues affect projects that rely on Ghidra and P-Code. We evaluate the executability of our semantics by building a P-Code interpreter that directly uses our semantics. Our work uncovered several issues in Ghidra and allows Ghidra users to better leverage P-Code.","[{""name"": ""Nico Naus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Freek Verbeek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dale Walker"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Binoy Ravindran"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_37"", ""10.1145/115372.115320"", ""10.1145/3471621.3471851"", ""10.1109/SP.2016.17""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Software', 'Signal Processing']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7598), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7575)]]"

Scenic has been successfully used for the design and analysis of CPS in a variety of domains, but earlier versions are limited to environments that are essentially two-dimensional. In this paper, we extend Scenic with native support for 3D geometry, introducing new syntax that provides expressive ways to describe 3D configurations while preserving the simplicity and readability of the language. We replace Scenic’s simplistic representation of objects as boxes with precise modeling of complex shapes, including a ray tracing-based visibility system that accounts for object occlusion. We also extend the language to support arbitrary temporal requirements expressed in LTL, and build an extensible Scenic parser generated from a formal grammar of the language. Finally, we illustrate the new application domains these features enable with case studies that would have been impossible to accurately model in Scenic 2.","[{""name"": ""Eric Vin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shun Kashiwa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthew Rhea"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel J.

Drawing on Cumann na mBan nominal rolls and U.S. immigration records, this article investigates the scale of post-Civil War Cumann na mBan emigration and evaluates the geographical origins, timing and push-pull factors that defined their migration. Focusing on the United States in particular, it also measures the impact of the emigration and return migration of female revolutionaries – during the revolutionary period and in its immediate aftermath – on both the republican movement in Ireland and the fractured political landscapes of Irish America. Ultimately, this article argues that the cooperative transatlantic exchange networks of Cumann na mBan, and the consciously gendered revolutionary discourse they assisted in propagating in the diaspora, were integral to supporting the Irish Revolution at home and abroad.","[{""name"": ""Síobhra Aiken"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7765/9781847799517"", ""10.5949/UPO9781846317651"", ""10.1080/09612025.2016.1237002""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Most recent work on alehouse sociability has considered attitudes towards drinking and its regulation after the early Jacobean legislation; in contrast, this article considers attitudes towards drunkenness in late sixteenth-century England, including the views expressed in the official ‘homily against drunkenness’ and in the Sabbatarian pamphlet published in 1572 by Humfrey Roberts. Similarly, most work on early modern protest considers complaints against the activities of the protestors’ social superiors; in this instance petitioners complained about the conduct of their inferiors. Although, due to archival attrition, it is impossible to determine what action the authorities took against Heyward and his clientele, thanks to the chance survival of a personal letter it is possible to reconstruct the reactions of the JPs to whom the petition was addressed, thus shedding light on how JPs might act outside the Quarter Sessions.","[{""name"": ""Heather Falvey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511555305"", ""10.1515/9781782043690"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511522529"", ""10.4324/9781315617848-7"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199271320.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0018246X11000197"", ""10.1057/9780230524330_6"", ""10.1017/S0022046900059005"", ""10.1017/9781782043119"", ""10.2307/2598219"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199584635.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03071020701425338"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-74243-4""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

This article sets out to investigate why Russian-speaking internet users residing in Germany justify anti-refugee discourse and how they construct the notion of “others.” Based on the netnographic analysis of the chosen online discussions and conducted interviews with its members, this article argues that, with the appearance of new “others,” Russian-speaking migrants have redefined their symbolic boundaries in order to draw the line between the incoming migrants and themselves—people with a migrant background. In many ways, participants of the analyzed discussions employed the politicized civilizational rhetoric that allowed them to redefine existing categorizations.

With the evolution of scholarly work on the British state, these measures are increasingly seen through the prism of state power, with the Scottish Gàidhealtachd cast as the victim of a fiscal-military system determined to impose obedience on its territory and peoples. In analyzing the implementation and enforcement of the laws passed between 1746 and 1752, this article challenges this narrative. By focusing attention on the legal system—particularly with regards enforcement—this article considers the local reception of the laws and the ideological, legal, and bureaucratic limitations to state authority. Yet it also explores how clan chiefs and traditional elites, who were the primary target of the legislation, quickly turned the laws to their own advantage. This analysis challenges the idea of effective state intervention in the Gàidhealtachd after 1746 and instead brings attention to how parliamentary legislation was mobilized by regional actors to local ends in ways that cast a long shadow over the history of the Scottish Highlands.","[{""name"": ""Matthew P.

10.1017/jbr.2020.125,JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES,0603 World History,"""The Show Is Not about Race'"": Custom, Screen Culture, and the Black and White Minstrel Show","AbstractIn 1967, when the BBC was faced with a petition by the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination requesting an end to the televised variety program the Black and White Minstrel Show (1958–1978), producers at the BBC, the press, and audience members collectively argued that the historic presence of minstrelsy in Britain rendered the practice of blacking up harmless. This article uses critical race theory as a useful framework for unpacking defenses that hinged on both the color blindness of white British audiences and the simultaneous existence of wider customs of blacking up within British television and film. I examine a range of “screen culture” from the 1920s to the 1970s, including feature films, home movies, newsreels, and television, that provide evidence of the existence of blackface as a type of racialized custom in British entertainment throughout this period. Efforts by organizations such as the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination, black press publications like Flamingo, and audiences of color to name blacking up and minstrelsy as racist in the late 1960s were met by fierce resistance from majority white audiences and producers, who denied their authority to do so. Concepts of color blindness or “racial innocence” thus become a useful means of examining, first, the wide-ranging existence of blacking-up practices within British screen culture; second, a broad reluctance by producers and the majority of audiences to identify this as racist; and third, the exceptional role that race played in characterizations of white audiences that were otherwise seen as historically fragile and impressionable in the face of screen content.","[{""name"": ""Christine Grandy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/030639689603800105"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719081675.001.0001"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwx019"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwx007"", ""10.1017/S0963926816000262"", ""10.1080/01439685.2013.847647"", ""10.1086/666052"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199226641.001.0001"", ""10.5949/liverpool/9781786940032.001.0001"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwu050"", ""10.1086/505959"", ""10.1177/016344300022001002"", ""10.1086/663017"", ""10.1017/jbr.2015.112"", ""10.1080/13555502.2014.889426"", ""10.7227/CST.7.1.7""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Nowhere was this more apparent than in the flagship institution of postwar British welfare, the National Health Service. When it launched in 1948, a shortage of thirty-five thousand nurses endangered its future. This article examines the National Health Service's nursing shortage and its most enduring solution: the recruitment of Caribbean and African nursing staff for struggling British hospitals. It follows the manner in which British civil servants, hospital administrators, and nursing leaders came to recruit nurses from the colonies and the deep ambivalence that marked their project. What began as a reformulated colonial development project gave rise to a sprawling and unregulated market for nursing labor that powered the National Health Service for decades. The so-called dark stranger, deemed unworthy of membership in the national community, in fact carried out its most intimate work—caring for the bodies of sick white citizens.","[{""name"": ""Catherine Babikian"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7591/9781501729331"", ""10.1177/030639689603800105"", ""10.1086/386134"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc16mn4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198725282.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9566.00234"", ""10.1086/386248"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226675312.001.0001"", ""10.1086/598214"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-27755-1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

This transition fundamentally changed production tasks, jobs, and job requirements. This paper uses digitized data on these two production modes from an 1899 U.S. Commissioner of Labor report to estimate the frequency and impact of the use of inanimate power on production operation times. About half of production operations were mechanized; the use of inanimate power raised productivity, accounting for about one-quarter to one-third of the overall productivity advantage of machine labor. However, additional factors, such as the increased division of labor and adoption of high-volume production, also played quantitatively important roles in raising productivity in machine production versus by hand.","[{""name"": ""Jeremy Atack"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Robert A.

As a result of the Soviet-Yugoslav split, Yugoslavia was expelled from the Women’s International Democratic Federation (WIDF), the main organization federating antifascist, communist, and socialist women, in 1949. To overcome international isolation, Yugoslav representatives established their own bilateral connections with women’s organizations internationally, particularly in the Global South. Throughout the Cold War, the main figure behind women’s internationalism in Yugoslavia was Vida Tomšič (1913–1998), a former partisan and leading politician, trained as a lawyer, who had a fundamental role both in nonaligned and UN settings. In this article, I further analyze Vida Tomšič’s visits to India, and examine her correspondence with Indian scholar and Women’s Studies pioneer Vina Mazumdar (1927–2013). The exchanges between Vina and Vida, as they amicably addressed each other, exemplify the significance of the alliance between activists from socialist countries and activists from the Global South during the UN Decade for Women.","[{""name"": ""Chiara Bonfiglioli"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/pastj/gts040"", ""10.1080/09612025.2012.726116"", ""10.1177/0971521516678531"", ""10.4324/9781315814452"", ""10.1080/08164649.2013.827304"", ""10.1162/JCWS_a_00006"", ""10.1086/682921"", ""10.1215/9781478003274"", ""10.1162/JCWS_a_00434"", ""10.2298/FID1603521B"", ""10.1177/1468018114527100"", ""10.1080/09614520903122337"", ""10.1353/jowh.2012.0044"", ""10.3167/asp.2014.080102"", ""10.1080/07075332.2015.1051569"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2009.11.008"", ""10.1080/14616740601066465"", ""10.1080/0023656X.2018.1429185"", ""10.2307/3346285""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

It focuses on women operating in and from the Habsburg embassy during the last two decades of the eighteenth century, a period marked by the revolutionary wars and the beginning of the ‘Eastern Question’. Using a microhistorical approach, this article analyses how women facilitated the embedding of individual members of the diplomatic corps in Pera's diplomatic social scene, the social integration of young diplomats, and the development of the trans-imperial networks of influence upon which diplomats heavily depended. It shifts the focus from states to actors and invites a more systematic development of a diplomatic history based on networks of non-official agents, thus enabling an improved understanding of the family, social, and urban dynamics that led to the development of political elites. This article draws on a set of private sources and parish sources in order to emphasize the role of households in the diplomacy of empires, the agenda of women in the management of patronage and power networks, and the diversity of their social affiliation.","[{""name"": ""David Do Paço"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3406/dhs.1995.2048"", ""10.1080/14616742.2018.1483206"", ""10.1080/07075332.2018.1482940"", ""10.7788/ha.2013.21.2.179"", ""10.1057/9781137063748"", ""10.1111/1468-0424.12416"", ""10.1353/wgy.2002.0014"", ""10.1017/S0018246X01001674""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Museology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

An analysis of a case study of north-east Spain (Aragón) (1900-2001),"AbstractThe aim of this article is to investigate how the characteristics of the different types of human settlements explain their demographic dynamics and, therefore, which of these have been affected to a greater extent by depopulation processes. For this purpose, we analyse the evolution of the population of Aragón (north-east Spain) in the period 1900–2001, according to the different types of population settlements that exist. Our results show that access to public services has played an essential role, especially when the construction of the welfare state made the rural population feel that there was a penalty for residing in settlements with problems to access them. The main settlements, headquarters of the municipal administration, have had advantages over the secondary settlements. Finally, the scattered population was the most affected and, therefore, emigrated to a greater extent, until this form of residence practically disappeared.","[{""name"": ""María Isabel Ayuda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pablo Gómez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vicente Pinilla"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0022050718000086"", ""10.2307/2937950"", ""10.1017/S0956793322000218"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2017.06.009"", ""10.1017/S0956793304001219"", ""10.1016/S1574-003X(97)80004-9"", ""10.1007/s10109-009-0092-x"", ""10.1086/261763"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805660"", ""10.1093/qje/qjs003"", ""10.1017/S0212610917000192"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2020.102442"", ""10.30827/dynamis.v41i1.22459"", ""10.1093/jeg/lbn038"", ""10.1017/S0212610900009125"", ""10.1093/restud/rds010"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2015.09.003"", ""10.3406/espos.1986.1161"", ""10.1016/S0166-0462(01)00065-5"", ""10.2478/euco-2021-0021"", ""10.1017/S0022050700025742"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2018.05.001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6389.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s00168-008-0260-9"", ""10.1111/soru.12119"", ""10.26882/histagrar.090e07c"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.01.002"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2008.00439.x"", ""10.1007/s00168-020-01036-9"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3303.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jeg/1.1.81"", ""10.1016/S0166-0462(01)00067-9"", ""10.1016/S1574-0080(04)80005-1"", ""10.1177/016001799761012334"", ""10.1016/j.jhg.2016.09.001"", ""10.1111/1468-0289.00075"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.03.003"", ""10.3390/land10040333"", ""10.1002/ldr.3303"", ""10.1111/0002-9092.00071"", ""10.1080/00343409312331347605"", ""10.1162/qjec.122.2.775"", ""10.1111/0022-4146.00179"", ""10.1023/A:1022870216673"", ""10.1017/S1361491605001462"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2021.103334""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Demography', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'General Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7446), ('0909 草学', 0.741)]]"

Drawing on ethnographic research in a deindustrialized Bosnian town and analysis of popular discourses seeking to make sense of this new wave of departures, I show how the phenomenon of postwar exit impacts those staying behind and inspires new forms of reflection that link past histories of violence to more recent forms of dispossession. The emergence of such forms of historical consciousness reveals that postwar migration is haunted both by the memory of wartime expulsions and ethnic cleansing, as well as by the often-unacknowledged violence of postwar economic restructuring glossed as the postsocialist transition. In asking what happens to nationalist regimes, as well as scholarship on nationalist politics, when the “people” leave, I demonstrate the need to analyze the ongoing out-migration both in terms of Bosnia’s historical specificity and global political-economic dynamics. In so doing, I show how absences created by these departures create new vantage points that bring to light and expose unsettling political configurations left behind by the Bosnian war.","[{""name"": ""Larisa Kurtović"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1463499618757896"", ""10.1111/cuan.12003"", ""10.3167/fcl.2018.800104"", ""10.1111/1469-8676.12717"", ""10.2307/j.ctvw04hp7"", ""10.1215/9780822395850"", ""10.1111/1471-0374.00043"", ""10.1002/psp.607"", ""10.5612/slavicreview.71.4.0849"", ""10.1017/S0010417509000188"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2013.723254"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1433.2011.01354.x"", ""10.4159/9780674369818"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2435.2006.00375.x"", ""10.1353/sor.2016.0050"", ""10.1215/9780822391852"", ""10.1215/08992363-4189167"", ""10.1080/01629778.2013.779059"", ""10.1080/21622671.2016.1160837"", ""10.1080/02757206.2018.1530668"", ""10.2298/MEDJP0502121P"", ""10.14506/ca32.4.06"", ""10.1525/ae.2002.29.3.693"", ""10.1111/j.1467-954X.2012.02097.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-5529-6"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199730360.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00141840801927509"", ""10.4324/9781315597690"", ""10.1177/0022009409340648"", ""10.2307/2499113"", ""10.1515/9781501750281"", ""10.1177/1466138110372586"", ""10.2307/j.ctvw04gv6"", ""10.3998/mpub.15543"", ""10.1525/9780520942622"", ""10.1080/00905992.2012.747503"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00398.x"", ""10.1215/9780822395133"", ""10.7591/9781501725654"", ""10.2307/3316581"", ""10.1086/450997"", ""10.2307/3316835"", ""10.1080/00085006.1978.11091531"", ""10.2307/j.ctt9qcxhw"", ""10.9783/9780812291223"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1t89kvv.10"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01308.x"", ""10.1080/23802014.2019.1646615"", ""10.3167/fcl.2010.570105"", ""10.7591/9781501712517"", ""10.1086/657626"", ""10.1111/1469-8676.12075"", ""10.3167/foc.2007.490103"", ""10.2307/j.ctt2005wzw"", ""10.2307/j.ctv9hvrsb"", ""10.3167/fcl.2010.570102"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2435.2006.00374.x"", ""10.1007/s10624-007-9005-x"", ""10.1215/9780822389163"", ""10.1068/d58j"", ""10.1177/0308275X17719988"", ""10.1515/9780691219653"", ""10.3167/fcl.2018.800102""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Managerial Failure and Corporate Ownership in Edwardian Britain,"Alfred Marshall argued that the malaise of public companies in Edwardian Britain was due to the separation of ownership from control and a lack of professional management. In this paper, we examine the ownership and control of the c.1,700 largest British companies in 1911. We find that most public companies had a separation of ownership and control, but that this had little effect on their performance. We also find that manager characteristics that proxy for amateurism are uncorrelated with performance. Ultimately, our evidence suggests that, if Marshall was correct in identifying a corporate malaise in Britain, its source lay elsewhere.","[{""name"": ""Michael Aldous"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Philip T.

While some concurrent-object operations are designed to behave atomically, each witnessing the atomic effects of predecessors in a linearization order, others forego such strong consistency to avoid complex control and synchronization bottlenecks. For example, contains (value) methods of key-value maps may iterate through key-value entries without blocking concurrent updates, to avoid unwanted performance bottlenecks, and consequently overlook the effects of some linearization-order predecessors. While such weakly-consistent operations may not be atomic, they still offer guarantees, e.g., only observing values that have been present.In this work we develop a methodology for proving that concurrent object implementations adhere to weak-consistency specifications. In particular, we consider (forward) simulation-based proofs of implementations against relaxed-visibility specifications, which allow designated operations to overlook some of their linearization-order predecessors, i.e., behaving as if they never occurred. Besides annotating implementation code to identify linearization points, i.e., points at which operations’ logical effects occur, we also annotate code to identify visible operations, i.e., operations whose effects are observed; in practice this annotation can be done automatically by tracking the writers to each accessed memory location. We formalize our methodology over a general notion of transition systems, agnostic to any particular programming language or memory model, and demonstrate its application, using automated theorem provers, by verifying models of Java concurrent object implementations.","[{""name"": ""Siddharth Krishna"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Emmi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Constantin Enea"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dejan Jovanović"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0304-3975(91)90224-P"", ""10.1007/s10009-016-0415-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73368-3_49"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66845-1_7"", ""10.1016/j.ic.2018.02.014"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_28"", ""10.1145/2578855.2535848"", ""10.2168/LMCS-11(1:20)2015"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-06410-9_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-73721-8_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_11"", ""10.1145/3290373"", ""10.2168/LMCS-6(3:6)2010"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21668-3_26"", ""10.1145/2480359.2429109"", ""10.1145/78969.78972"", ""10.1017/S0956796818000151"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54434-1_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-47666-6_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-17511-4_20"", ""10.1145/2499370.2462189"", ""10.1006/inco.1995.1134"", ""10.1145/248052.248106"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2008.04.078"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-28644-8_4"", ""10.1145/360051.360224"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_9"", ""10.1145/3290381"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31424-7_21"", ""10.1145/2813885.2737964"", ""10.1145/3022671.2983999"", ""10.1007/11532231_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-93900-9_27"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_40"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-11319-2_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21668-3_1""]",['Computer Science'],"['Hardware and Architecture', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

10.1017/S0963926820000590,URBAN HISTORY,0603 World History,"Urban civil defence: imagining, constructing and performing nuclear war in Aarhus","AbstractDuring the Cold War, cities were seen as likely targets of modern total warfare and systems of civil defence were created to protect cities and their inhabitants. Yet existing civil defence histories have focused little on the specifically urban aspect, and urban historians likewise have paid civil defence little attention. Using Aarhus, Denmark, as a case-study, this article examines civil defence through planning, practices and materiality in a specific urban landscape. By analysing how civil defence was organized, performed and built in Denmark, the article sheds light on the mutual imbrication of urban planning, geography and materiality and local civil defence. I argue that through biopolitics, local civil defence authorities imagineered an idealized survivalist community of city dwellers who would pull together to protect and save their city and that this contributed to taming an incomprehensible, global, nuclear catastrophe into a manageable, localized, urban calamity.","[{""name"": ""Rosanna Farbøl"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/book.16013"", ""10.1177/0263276409349658"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226276663.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13688804.2018.1491792"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1360.2008.00012.x"", ""10.7228/manchester/9781784994402.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400843558"", ""10.1057/9780230594180"", ""10.1080/14682745.2014.968558"", ""10.1093/gerhis/ghp003"", ""10.1017/S0963926815000565"", ""10.1017/S0963926815000553"", ""10.1080/13619462.2018.1519423"", ""10.1017/S0007087412001112"", ""10.1177/0263276409349280"", ""10.1057/9780230274044"", ""10.1093/tcbh/hwr034"", ""10.1017/S0963926815000590"", ""10.1093/envhis/ems049"", ""10.1002/9780470753033"", ""10.1080/13604810903298425""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

Unlike the migration of Polish (non-Roma) citizens there was an intriguing silence regarding the migration of this ethnic group. The absence of Roma in the grand narrative of migrations from Poland, as we argue, suggests that the notion of belonging and citizenship were unequally distributed among Poland’s population. Based on our ongoing ethnographic research among Polish Roma migrants, complemented by an analysis of relevant documents, we argue that these inequalities and hierarchies are deeply rooted and there is an interesting continuity in how they were produced and reproduced prior to and after the 1989 regime change. We argue that one of the key factors in these movements, the collectiveness of the migration project – i.e. migrating as an extended family group as a component of the moral economy of Roma mobility – is mutually produced by unequal citizenship, mobility regimes and strong moral obligations stemming from kinship ties.","[{""name"": ""Kamila Fiałkowska"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elżbieta Mirga-Wójtowicz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michał P.

While Zionists found striking similarities between the unfolding realities in Palestine/Israel and South Asia, the exact nature of the comparison was quite equivocal. On the diplomatic axis, Israelis sought to establish full diplomatic relations with India by underscoring the similarity of their two nations. Here, comparisons were a way of positioning Israel as an analogue of India. On the technocratic axis, Israelis looked to Pakistan as a model for constructing legal institutions to expropriate Palestinian property. The appeal of Pakistan as a model was due to a perceived glaring difference: Pakistan was a Muslim state, Israel the Jewish State. Meanwhile, as Zionists/Israelis looked to India and Pakistan, Indians returned the gaze. Indian technocrats found the methods Israel used to resettle Jewish refugees and immigrants worthy of emulation. When they came to Israel to study these resettlement efforts, they were-unknowingly-often looking at projects that had been built upon former Palestinian land which the Israeli government had seized using the transplanted Pakistani law-the very same laws that had dispossessed India's new citizens, whom the technocrats were seeking to resettle. This article ultimately uncovers a broader post-imperial technocratic sphere in which nascent states continued to transplant legal institutions developed in other parts of the former colonial world to construct their own.","[{""name"": ""Rephael G.

Due to the complexity of such a language framework, it is a big challenge to ensure its trustworthiness and to establish the correctness of the autogenerated language tools. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach based onproof generation. The key idea is to generate proof objects as correctness certificates for each individual task that the language tools conduct, on a case-by-case basis, and use a trustworthy proof checker to check the proof objects. This way, we avoid formally verifying the entire framework, which is practically impossible, and thus can make the language framework bothpracticalandtrustworthy. As a first step, we formalize program execution as mathematical proofs and generate their complete proof objects. The experimental result shows that the performance of our proof object generation and proof checking is very promising.","[{""name"": ""Xiaohong Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhengyao Lin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Minh-Thai Trinh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Grigore Roşu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/2676726.2676982"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81688-9_23"", ""10.1145/3408970"", ""10.1145/2983990.2984027"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314601"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_6"", ""10.1145/2103621.2103719"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_24"", ""10.1109/CSF.2018.00022"", ""10.1016/0304-3975(82)90125-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11164-3_24"", ""10.1145/2737924.2737991""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Unfortunately, DNNs are “black-boxes”, and cannot be interpreted by humans, which is a substantial concern in safety-critical systems. To mitigate this issue, researchers have begun working on explainable AI (XAI) methods, which can identify a subset of input features that are the cause of a DNN’s decision for a given input. Most existing techniques are heuristic, and cannot guarantee the correctness of the explanation provided. In contrast, recent and exciting attempts have shown that formal methods can be used to generate provably correct explanations. Although these methods are sound, the computational complexity of the underlying verification problem limits their scalability; and the explanations they produce might sometimes be overly complex. Here, we propose a novel approach to tackle these limitations. We (i) suggest an efficient, verification-based method for findingminimal explanations, which constitute aprovable approximationof the global, minimum explanation; (ii) show how DNN verification can assist in calculating lower and upper bounds on the optimal explanation; (iii) propose heuristics that significantly improve the scalability of the verification process; and (iv) suggest the use ofbundles, which allows us to arrive at more succinct and interpretable explanations. Our evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, and produces explanations that are more useful to humans. We thus regard this work as a step toward leveraging verification technology in producing DNNs that are more reliable and comprehensible.","[{""name"": ""Shahaf Bassan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guy Katz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33016006"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_11"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2009.08.017"", ""10.1201/9781003278290-37"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_36"", ""10.1145/3319535.3354245"", ""10.1145/3332409"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-17108-6_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_3"", ""10.1145/3452296.3472936"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0316-z"", ""10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01550"", ""10.1137/15M1055024"", ""10.18653/v1/2020.emnlp-main.498"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-55754-6_5"", ""10.29007/699q"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2020/726"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-80223-3_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-77091-4_21"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33011511"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94205-6_41"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-23219-5_13"", ""10.2514/1.G003724"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.1007/s10703-021-00363-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2021/366"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375833"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.3233/FAIA201007"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2004.11.002"", ""10.1561/9781680837872"", ""10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21499"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-19992-9_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-21222-2_4"", ""10.1016/0004-3702(87)90062-2"", ""10.1145/2939672.2939778"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11491"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.74"", ""10.24963/kr.2020/91"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/708"", ""10.1145/3290354"", ""10.1007/s10994-021-06050-2"", ""10.1016/j.cviu.2017.03.007"", ""10.1109/TEVC.2019.2890858"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-88693-8_52"", ""10.1613/jair.1.12359"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99524-9_8"", ""10.1145/3241979""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Combining words and images, comics enable the expression of individual and collective histories that straddle languages and cultures, reflecting the multimodality of the cognitive and narrative processes in a multilingual, globalising world. This article proposes an original framework to understand the power of comics as a transcultural medium by exploring the production of Takoua Ben Mohamed, a graphic journalist and comics author born in Tunisia and raised in Rome. These comics visualise histories of migration and translation in Italy and the Mediterranean, questioning notions of homogeneity, authenticity and canonicity of Italian memory and culture. The article engages with the theoretical and methodological framework of the Transnationalizing Modern Languages (TML) research project, exploring the interconnected linguistic and cultural dimensions of memory and translation. The analysis identifies a series of processes termed mediation-translation in Ben Mohamed's comics, which illuminate the constitutive nature of memory and translation in contemporary processes of identification.","[{""name"": ""Barbara Spadaro"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9781315817576"", ""10.1515/9783110217384"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190230814.003.0014"", ""10.1080/13534645.2011.605570"", ""10.1111/lic3.12312"", ""10.3726/978-3-0353-0790-0"", ""10.1080/21504857.2018.1449125"", ""10.14325/mississippi/9781617036132.001.0001"", ""10.1353/fge.2007.0038"", ""10.1080/17449855.2016.1219139"", ""10.1162/afar.2007.40.2.16""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['Speech and Hearing', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Their political philosophy emphasised individualism against collectivism and criticised Finland's state-centred political culture. Special focus is on the party's ideas of reforming the Finnish welfare state. The Young Finns wanted to retain universal education and healthcare services but pursued radical tax, social security and labour market reforms with ideas inspired by neoliberal thinkers. The article argues that the Young Finns represented a Finnish variant of neoliberalism in their goal of retasking the welfare state into a slimmer enabler of individual freedom.","[{""name"": ""Ilkka Kärrylä"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190600389.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00076791.2019.1598379"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199580576.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03085147.2015.1013356"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc775rf"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9515.2004.00382.x"", ""10.1017/S0960777315000247"", ""10.1080/03585522.2017.1371638"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719074394.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03468755.2017.1336599"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89584-0"", ""10.4324/9780203279236"", ""10.1177/0032329211420082"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139087230""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

10.1017/S0010417522000019,COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN SOCIETY AND HISTORY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,The Talat-Tehlirian Complex: Contentious Narratives of Martyrdom and Revenge in Post-Conflict Societies,"AbstractThe assassination of Talat Pasha by Soghomon Tehlirian on 15 March 1921 in Berlin, as well as Tehlirian’s trial and acquittal on 2–3 June 1921, have contributed to the formation of conflicting legacies of the Armenian Genocide. Though minuscule in terms of violence and legal ramifications, these events and their reimagination in contentious narratives have shaped a dominant prism of sensemaking in Turkish-Armenian relations. In the imagination of rival groups, Talat and Tehlirian compete for the very same normative categories of hero and victim at once and each are demonized as a villain and perpetrator. Moreover, it is each figure’s embodiment of martyrdom and revenge that explains why their heroizations have proved so enduring and effective across time and space. This mutual framework of sensemaking, which I call the Talat-Tehlirian complex, ultimately denies the chances of historical reconciliation. In terms of its theoretical implications, this case study explains how a martyr-avenger complex can continuously demand solidarity, sustain grievances, and sacralize violence in post-conflict societies. Based on a thick description of what happened in Berlin in 1921 and its contentious narratives across different generations, this paper calls for a transition to a post-heroic age in Turkish-Armenian relations.","[{""name"": ""Alp Yenen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5040/9780755609024"", ""10.1086/230820"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628061"", ""10.4159/9780674038615"", ""10.1080/01402398708437322"", ""10.2307/2580449"", ""10.7591/9781501735080"", ""10.1017/S0010417517000457"", ""10.1007/s11186-018-9310-1"", ""10.1057/9780230582736"", ""10.5040/9781350222366"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190050047.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctvxcrxk4"", ""10.1093/jicj/mqy035"", ""10.1177/0022009419884627"", ""10.1057/9780230118874"", ""10.1515/9780804797191"", ""10.1353/sor.2008.0038"", ""10.1080/00263206.2018.1462161"", ""10.1191/1743872105lw023oa""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/ssh.2024.6,SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY,0603 World History,The Swiss Patrician Families between Decline and Persistence: Power Positions and Kinship Ties (1890-1957),"AbstractScholarship demonstrated the major role of inheritance and kinship for elite’s power reproduction, particularly among noble families. In the absence of monarchic and court structures, ruling classes that enjoyed privileges and engaged in social closure could become the functional equivalent of a nobility. In this paper, we examine the evolution of the power of Swiss patrician families in the three major Swiss cities (Basel, Geneva, and Zurich) since the end of the nineteenth century and assess whether urban oligarchies endure in the twentieth century and what role kinship ties play in the reproduction of power structures. Building on a systematic database of 5,199 urban elites who hold power positions in the main economic, political, academic, and cultural institutions, we describe the evolution of Swiss patrician families between 1890 and 1957. Using social network, kinship, and sequence analysis, we provide a comprehensive investigation of the Swiss patrician elite’s evolution at both the individual and the family level. Our analyses show a general decline of patrician families’ presence in urban positions of power, however with significant variations according to both the cities and the spheres of activity. Furthermore, we identify distinct trajectories of families who have either lost their access to power positions, managed to access again or have remained in urban power positions according to different survival strategies. Beyond the Swiss case, we contribute to the literature on power and kinship through an interdisciplinary approach combining historical and sociological perspectives.","[{""name"": ""Pierre Benz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pedro Araujo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Geoffroy Legentilhomme"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""André Mach"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Steven Piguet"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael A.

Proposing the category of “entrepreneurial management” to describe the countervailing tendency, it demonstrates the persistence of intellectual interest in managers who used the personal qualities of leadership to enlist enthusiasm among subordinates for their firm's initiatives. By the mid-twentieth century, these managerial leaders were commonly described as “entrepreneurs.” Through a reading of early twentieth-century writing on “human factor” management and Depression-era “human relations” theory, the article shows that intellectual interest in entrepreneurial leadership thrived during a period typically characterized as the height of scientific management and corporate bureaucracy. Analyzing Peter F. Drucker's postwar management writing in detail, the article concludes by arguing that the “entrepreneurialism” of the late twentieth century did not represent a break with the established managerial project, only the strengthened authority of one existing tendency within a variegated intellectual field.","[{""name"": ""Erik Baker"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/000271621908100107"", ""10.2307/1883096"", ""10.1177/0018726712452168"", ""10.1017/S0007680518000065"", ""10.1002/jhbs.21650"", ""10.7202/1022869ar"", ""10.1002/1520-6696(196810)4:4<316::AID-JHBS2300040403>3.0.CO;2-Z"", ""10.1353/jsh/14.1.67"", ""10.2307/259040""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management Information Systems', 'Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)]]"

In 1940, the correlation between years of schooling and earnings was relatively low. In this article, we estimate the causal return to schooling in 1940, constructing a large linked sample of twin brothers to account for differences in unobserved ability and family background. We find that each additional year of schooling increased labor earnings by approximately 4 percent, about half the return found for more recent cohorts in twins studies. These returns were evident both within and across occupations and were higher for sons from lower socio-economic status families.","[{""name"": ""James J.

The starting premise is that a notable familiarity with Spanish culture (language and religion) as a former African colony and a long period of settlement in Spain that dates back to the 1940s should have favoured greater social advancement of this group. However, the fieldwork shows that they have been held back by the marginalised position of Equatorial Guinea in Spain's current collective imaginary of its colonial past, as well as by the socio-laboural precariousness they have experienced since their arrival. Based on the body of thought of postcolonial theory, and from a predominantly anthropological and historical standpoint, this article analyses the heavy burden of social invisibility and unequal economic opportunities that these women carry. The paper concludes that migrant memories must be incorporated into the Hispano-African narrative to create a more trustworthy account of the shared Spanish and Equatorial Guinean past, and that there is an urgent need to implement policies in Spain that promote equality regardless of ethnicity, race, and gender.","[{""name"": ""Yolanda Aixelà-Cabré"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/9780822377719"", ""10.7588/worllitetoda.86.5.0032"", ""10.1080/13621025.2016.1252719"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300125207.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00083968.2011.9707533"", ""10.1515/ijsl-2016-0002"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139047777"", ""10.1177/026272808700700103"", ""10.1080/09502386.2012.669774"", ""10.1057/9780230390324"", ""10.1080/14636204.2016.1240435"", ""10.1017/S0010417500002589"", ""10.1525/9780520938618"", ""10.1080/00083968.2016.1276848"", ""10.4324/9781315668086"", ""10.5195/REVIBEROAMER.2014.7207"", ""10.1080/14636200601084030""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Religious studies', 'History', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
