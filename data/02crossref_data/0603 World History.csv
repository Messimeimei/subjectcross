One focus of debate concerns the relation between populism and nationalism. Criticising the tendency to conflate populism and nationalism, De Cleen and Stavrakakis argue for a sharp conceptual distinction between the two. They situate populist discourse on a vertical, and nationalist discourse on a horizontal axis. I argue that this strict conceptual separation cannot capture the productive ambiguity of populist appeals to ‘the people’, evoking at once plebs, sovereign demos and bounded community. The frame of reference for populist discourse is most fruitfully understood as a two‐dimensional space, at once a space of inequality and a space of difference. Vertical opposition to those on top (and often those on the bottom) and horizontal opposition to those outside are tightly interwoven, generally in such a way that economic, political and cultural elites are represented as being ‘outside’ as well as ‘on top’. The ambiguity and two‐dimensionality of appeals to ‘the people’ do not result from the conflation of populism and nationalism; they are a constitutive feature of populism itself, a practical resource that can be exploited in constructing political identities and defining lines of political opposition and conflict.","[('Rogers Brubaker', 'Sociology University of California  Los Angeles CA USA')]","['10.1017/CBO9780511558764', '10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7', '10.1111/j.1477-7053.1984.tb01048.x', '10.1111/1467-9248.00184', '10.1057/9781403920072_2', '10.1177/186810341603500305', '10.18573/j.2016.10043', '10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083', '10.5771/9783845271491-361', '10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.02050.x', '10.1111/1467-8675.12308', '10.1111/j.1467-9558.2011.01388.x', '10.1177/1368431018772507', '10.1017/S0022216X98005033', '10.1057/9781403920072_1', '10.1111/1467-9248.12032', '10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001', '10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x', '10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001', '10.9783/9780812293784', '10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.17', '10.4324/9780203963678', '10.1353/wp.1995.0004', '10.1080/13510347.2011.572619', '10.1080/13569310701822289', '10.1080/1356931042000263519', '10.1111/1467-8675.12127', '10.1177/2041905818796577', '10.1080/17405904.2017.1309325', '10.3817/0395103009', '10.1080/08913819608443423', '10.2307/422412', '10.1515/9781400888894', '10.23943/9781400889501']",Wiley

The combination of fast and stringent NPIs reduced peak mortality by 50 percent and cumulative excess mortality by 24 to 34 percent. However, while the pandemic itself was associated with short-run economic disruptions, we find that these disruptions were similar across cities with strict and lenient NPIs. NPIs also did not worsen medium-run economic outcomes. Our findings indicate that NPIs can reduce disease transmission without further depressing economic activity, a finding also reflected in discussions in contemporary newspapers.","[('Sergio Correia', ''), ('Stephan Luck', ''), ('Emil Verner', '')]",[],Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Starting from the premise that nationalism is a global and ubiquitous idea in the contemporary world, it explores whether exclusionary tendencies have been reinforced by the pandemic. The pandemic and government responses will not necessarily trigger the increase in exclusionary nationalism that both far-right politicians and observers have noted. However, there are 4 aspects, examined in the article, that might be shaped by the pandemic. These include the recent trajectory of nationalism and its social relevance prior to the pandemic,the rise of authoritarianism as governments suspend or reduce democratic freedoms and civil liberties, the rise of biases against some groups associated with the pandemic, the rise of borders and deglobalization, and the politics of fear. Thus, while the rise of exclusionary nationalism might not be the inevitable consequence of the pandemic, it risks reinforcing preexisting nationalist dynamics.","[('Florian Bieber', '')]","['10.1080/17449057.2018.1532635', '10.1080/17449057.2018.1532633', '10.5539/res.v9n1p158', '10.1111/j.1467-9760.2008.00325.x', '10.1111/1468-4446.12325', '10.1177/0022343311425693', '10.5040/9781350098558', '10.1525/9780520342057', '10.1111/1467-9248.12072', '10.1080/09557570008400339', '10.4324/9780203806210', '10.1017/S0043887100020852', '10.2105/AJPH.2018.304328', '10.1017/9781108589451', '10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02328']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

The significance of a deliberately generic but fundamentally meaningful concept such as ‘far right’ is motivated by the growing links between illiberal‐democratic (‘radical right’) and anti‐democratic (‘extreme right’) collective actors. This begs considering the conceptual grounds for differentiation among far‐right collective actors, their underlying dynamics, and why it is important to look at what they do to tackle this phenomenon in practice—that is, to extrapolate their ideological essence and their varying allegiances to democracy. The complexity of far‐right politics questions the long‐standing conceptual distinctions internally defining it. The use of an umbrella concept may thus enhance precision in the discussion of this phenomenon, at the same time highlighting the unfolding of a new phase in nativist politics.","[('Andrea L P Pirro', 'Faculty of Political and Social Sciences Scuola Normale Superiore  Florence Italy')]","['10.1017/S1537592720003552', '10.4324/9780203867259', '10.1177/0891241606298815', '10.1111/1467-9248.00184', '10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-134020', '10.1080/13569317.2018.1451227', '10.1007/978-3-319-71752-4_10', '10.1057/s41253-020-00124-8', '10.1111/1475-6765.12484', '10.1353/wp.1997.0009', '10.1017/9781108227926', '10.1080/21599165.2020.1718657', '10.1080/713682938', '10.1080/1369118X.2020.1792532', '10.1080/21599165.2022.2037079', '10.5817/PC2018-1-28', '10.1111/1477-7053.00022', '10.1080/14782804.2013.766473', '10.1017/CBO9780511492037', '10.9783/9780812293784', '10.1093/oso/9780198837886.001.0001', '10.17813/1086-671X-23-3-367', '10.1177/1354068819863624', '10.1017/S1537592721001924', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198803560.001.0001', '10.1080/09644009308404323', '10.17645/pag.v9i4.4566', '10.4324/9780367260569', '10.2307/1958356', '10.4324/9780367260569-16', '10.1080/13569310306084', '10.1080/21599165.2020.1787163', '10.1177/1474885116677901']",Wiley

Segmentation is valuable for two significant clinical applications, namely lesion detection and classification, providing means to improve accuracy and robustness. The manual segmentation of polyps in colonoscopy images is time-consuming. As a result, the use of deep learning (DL) for automation of polyp segmentation has become important. However, DL-based solutions can be vulnerable to overfitting and the resulting inability to generalise to images captured by different colonoscopes. Recent transformer-based architectures for semantic segmentation both achieve higher performance and generalise better than alternatives, however typically predict a segmentation map of $$\frac{h}{4}\times \frac{w}{4}$$ spatial dimensions for a $$h\times w$$ input image. To this end, we propose a new architecture for full-size segmentation which leverages the strengths of a transformer in extracting the most important features for segmentation in a primary branch, while compensating for its limitations in full-size prediction with a secondary fully convolutional branch. The resulting features from both branches are then fused for final prediction of a $$h\times w$$ segmentation map.

To structure the discussion, the contributors respond to three questions: (1) how should we understand the relationship between nationalism and COVID‐19; (2) will COVID‐19 fuel ethnic and nationalist conflict; and (3) will COVID‐19 reinforce or erode the nation‐state in the long run? The contributors formulated their responses to these questions near to the outset of the pandemic, amid intense uncertainty. This made it acutely difficult, if not impossible, to make predictions. Nevertheless, it was felt that a historically and theoretically informed discussion would shed light on the types of political processes that could be triggered by the COVID‐19 pandemic. In doing so, the aim is to help orient researchers and policy‐makers as they grapple with what has rapidly become the most urgent issue of our times.","[('Eric Taylor Woods', 'University of East London  London UK'), ('Robert Schertzer', 'University of Toronto  Ontario Canada'), ('Liah Greenfeld', 'Boston University  Boston Massachusetts USA'), ('Chris Hughes', 'London School of Economics and Political Science  London UK'), ('Cynthia Miller‐Idriss', 'American University  Washington, D.C.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the employability skills lacking in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) industry from employers' perspectives to assist STEM educational institutions in creating more relevant programs inclusive of employability skills.Design/methodology/approachThis study addresses 16 job-specific skills based on data deriving from the responses of 250 Human Resource Managers (HRMs) who represent five manufacturing industries (Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Consumer Products, Electronics and Industrial Manufacturing) located in five regions (Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, West-Mountain and Pacific) of the United States.FindingsThe median scores for all 16 skills confirmed their importance for employability in the five manufacturing industries. The five highest ranking skills were team player, self-motivation, verbal communication, problem-solving and being proactive, which align with previous studies on workplace skills.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper is a call to all STEM educational institution stakeholders, both internal and external, to re-assess current curriculum and programs and collaborate to narrow the gap between graduate competencies and the practical needs of the workplace.Originality/valueThis paper attempts to bridge the gap between the competencies gained in STEM educational institutions and the competencies needed for the future workplace, as confirmed by HRM professionals. Although this study is focused on STEM educational institutions in the United States, it will be of interest to all STEM educational institutions worldwide who play a significant role in preparing the next generation of employees for the global workplace.","[('Doreen McGunagle', ''), ('Laura Zizka', '')]","['10.1177/152342231/8814546', '10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.04.261', '10.1177/10805699/244/360', '10.1080/23752696.2018.1462094', '10.1080/03075079.2017.1294152', '10.1108/00400910710754435', '10.1080/10668926.2011.567143', '10.13140/RG/2/2/16805/35044', '10.1080/1356251032000052294', '10.1016/j.procs.2013.09.316', '10.1007/s10956-019-09778-8', '10.1109/TALE.2018.8615414', '10.1108/HESWBL-02-2018-0016', '10.3794/ijme.82.267', '10.26634/jmgt.10.3.3783', '10.15394/jaaer.2018.1738', '10.1080/0042098042000316100', '10.21153/jtlge2015vol6no1art576', '10.1016/j.spbspro.2015.08.139', '10.1007/s10956-018-9735-3', '10.5032/jae.2018.01297', '10.1111/j.1465-3435.2004.00194.x', '10.1111/eject.12155']",Emerald

European Far-Right Parties and COVID-19,[],"AbstractIt has become received wisdom that the pandemic has “exposed” the political incompetence of far-right parties in government and that far-right parties in opposition have become its (first) “victims.” This is largely based on the generalization of one or two individual cases—most notably US president Donald Trump—who is the exception rather than the rule. This article provides a comparative analysis of far-right responses to the COVID-19 pandemic within the European Union. Based on theoretical insights from previous research, we expect the responses to reflect the main ideology and the internal heterogeneity of the contemporary far right as well as to show the increasing mainstreaming of its positions. We analyze four different, but related, aspects: (1) the narratives about COVID-19 from far-right parties; (2) the proposed solutions of far-right parties; (3) the electoral consequences of the pandemic for far-right parties; and (4) the success of far-right parties in dealing with the pandemic. Finally, in the discussion we shortly look ahead at the possible consequences of a highly likely second outbreak of COVID-19.","[('Jakub Wondreys', ''), ('Cas Mudde', '')]","['10.1080/01402388808424678', '10.1353/jod.2019.0066', '10.1111/1467-9248.12146', '10.1017/CBO9780511492037', '10.1057/cep.2011.19', '10.2307/1955610', '10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

A good classification not only gives generally accepted and understandable names to similar rocks but also links the bulk chemical composition to the stoichiometry of the constituent minerals and, potentially, also to the likely source, magmatic evolution and tectonic setting. The ‘ideal’ granitoid classification should be based on chemical criteria amenable to an objective treatment. Statistical analysis helps to identify the most discriminant variables. The key properties are (1) acidity/maficity, (2) alkalinity (balance of Na + K v. Ca), (3) aluminosity (balance of Al v. Ca, Na and K), (4) Fe/Mg balance and (5) Na/K balance and K contents at the given SiO 2 level. These are used by successful classifications, e.g. the I/S dichotomy is based mainly on aluminosity, while the Frost et al. (2001; ‘A geochemical classification for granitic rocks', Journal of Petrology , 42 , 2033–2048, https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/42.11.2033 ) classification includes all but Na/K. Even though it is commonplace to use weight percentages of oxides, we suggest that a better strategy is to employ simple atomic parameters (e.g. millications-based) that can be directly linked to modal proportions and compositions/crystal structure of individual rock-forming minerals. This facilitates a petrological interpretation, which, in turn, can be related to petrogenesis and, ultimately, to likely tectonic setting(s).","[('Bernard Bonin', 'UMR 8148 ‘GEOPS’, Université

The sequence of S- to I- to A-type granite is repeated at least three times. All the granites are syn-extensional, formed in a dominantly back-arc setting behind a single, stepwise-retreating arc system between 530 and 230 Ma. Peralkaline granites are rare. Systematic S–I–A progressions indicate the progressive dilution of an old crustal component as magmatism evolved from arc (S-type) to proximal back-arc (I-type) to distal back-arc (A-type) magmatism. The alkaline and peralkaline A-type Younger granites of Nigeria were generally hotter and drier than the Lachlan A-type granites and were emplaced into an anhydrous Precambrian basement during intermittent intracontinental rifting. This geodynamic environment contrasts with the distal back-arc setting of the Lachlan A-type granites, where magmatism migrated rapidly across the orogen. Tectonic discrimination diagrams are inappropriate for the Lachlan granites, placing them in the wrong settings. Only the peralkaline Narraburra suite of the Lachlan Orogen fits the genuine ‘within-plate’ setting of the Nigerian A-type granites. Such discrimination diagrams require re-evaluation in the light of an improved modern understanding of tectonic processes, particularly the role of extensional tectonism and its geodynamic drivers.","[('William J.

We re-examine the prevailing model inferred from this classification that magma-rich margins have excess decompression melting at lithospheric breakup compared with steady-state seafloor spreading, while magma-poor margins have inhibited melting. We investigate the magmatic budget related to lithospheric breakup along two high-resolution long-offset deep reflection seismic profiles across the SE Indian (magma-poor) and Uruguayan (magma-rich) rifted margins. Resolving the magmatic budget is difficult and several interpretations can explain our seismic observations, implying different mechanisms to achieve lithospheric breakup and melt production for each archetype. We show that the Uruguayan and other magma-rich margins may indeed involve excess decompression melting compared with steady-state seafloor spreading but could also be explained by a gradual increase with an early onset relative to crustal breakup. A late onset of decompression melting relative to crustal breakup enables mantle exhumation characteristic of magma-poor margin archetypes (e.g. SE India). Despite different volumes of magmatism, the mechanisms suggested at lithospheric breakup are comparable between both archetypes. Considerations on the timing of decompression melting onset relative to crustal thinning may be more important than the magmatic budget to understand the evolution and variability of rifted margins.","[('Julie Tugend', 'Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg, CNRS-UMR 7516, Université de Strasbourg, 1 rue Blessig, F-67084 Strasbourg Cedex, France'), ('Julie Tugend', 'Current

Yet genetic approaches to plague’s history have established that Yersinia pestis, the causative organism of plague, suddenly diverged in Central Asia at some point before the Black Death, splitting into four new branches—a divergence geneticists have called the “Big Bang.” Drawing on a “biological archive” of genetic evidence, I trace the bacterial descendants of the Big Bang proliferation, comparing that data to historical human activities in and around the area of plague’s emergence. The Mongols, whose empire emerged in 1206, unwittingly moved plague through Central Eurasia in the thirteenth, not the fourteenth, century. Grain shipments that the Mongols brought with them to several sieges, including the siege of Baghdad, were the most likely mechanism of transmission. The fourteenth century plague outbreaks represent local spillover events out of the new plague reservoirs seeded by the military campaigns of the thirteenth century.","[('Monica H.

The study was conducted taking measurements of deformation features such as fractures and deformation bands on multiple 1D scanlines along fault walls. The resulting datasets are used to plot the frequency distribution of deformation features and to constrain the geometrical width of the damage zone for the studied faults. The damage-zone width of a single fault is constrained by identifying the changes in the slope of cumulative plots made on the frequency data. The cumulative plot further shows high deformation frequency by a steep slope (inner damage zone) and less deformation as a gentle slope (outer damage zone). Statistical distributions of displacement and damage-zone width and their relationship are improved, and show two-slope power-law distributions with a break point at c. 100 m displacement. Bleached sandstones in the studied siliciclastic rocks of Utah are associated with a higher frequency of deformation bands and a wider damage zone compared to the unbleached zone of similar lithology. Fault damage zones in the carbonate rocks of Majella are often host to open fractures (karst), demonstrating that they can also be conductive to fluid flow.","[('A.

Yet this surge of interest leaves at least two important questions unanswered. Where was nationalism before its apparent resurgence? Are contemporary forms of nationalism different from their predecessors, and can these changes be linked to digital technologies? To answer these questions, we argue for the importance of understanding the less visible ways in which digital technologies reproduce our sense of belonging to a world of nations. We discuss three such mechanisms: the architecture of internet domains, the bias of algorithms and the formation of national digital ecosystems. Next, we examine three characteristics of contemporary nationalism that can be partly linked to recent shifts in the global communication ecology: diversification, fragmentation and commodification. We conclude by considering the implications of our arguments for future research in the field.","[('Sabina Mihelj', 'School of Social Sciences and Humanities Loughborough University Loughborough UK'), ('César Jiménez‐Martínez', 'School of Journalism, Media and Culture Cardiff University Cardiff UK')]","['10.1177/0267323115614485', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199752164.001.0001', '10.1093/joc/jqx017', '10.1163/1871191X-14011032', '10.1111/nana.12480', '10.1007/978-3-319-70123-3', '10.1177/1940161219862988', '10.1177/1469540517690570', '10.1080/15405702.2013.751855', '10.1080/1369183X.2012.698204', '10.1080/10304310903026594', '10.1515/popets-2015-0007', '10.1177/1748048519880731', '10.4159/9780674030305', '10.1177/1940161218790035', '10.1080/14616700306488', '10.1080/1369118X.2018.1428656', '10.1017/9781316800058', '10.1111/cccr.12152', '10.1080/1369118X.2016.1207697', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2007.00273.x', '10.1177/1468796808088925', '10.1177/1461444809342738', '10.7551/mitpress/9780262525374.003.0009', '10.1007/s00146-016-0644-9', '10.1177/14614440022225689', '10.1177/1750481318771448', '10.1080/19392397.2016.1218292', '10.1017/9781316534168', '10.1017/9781316534168.002', '10.1075/jlp.17032.kre', '10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7_14', '10.1080/14672715.2017.1341188', '10.4324/9780429447754', '10.18574/nyu/9781479895120.001.0001', '10.28945/3331', '10.1017/9781108589451', '10.1007/978-3-030-04405-3', '10.1007/978-0-230-34529-4', '10.1017/9781108595841', '10.1007/978-1-137-06147-8', '10.4159/9780674369542', '10.1080/17544750.2019.1572633', '10.1177/0196859917754053', '10.1177/1461444814535724', '10.1093/oso/9780190876791.001.0001', '10.2202/1944-2866.1075', '10.1111/comt.12028', '10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7', '10.1111/comt.12001', '10.1177/1527476416655384', '10.1177/1367877919887757', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199755509.001.0001', '10.1515/9781400884711', '10.1145/2447976.2447990', '10.1177/1461444814530096', '10.1177/1367549417751148', '10.1080/23808985.2017.1288551', '10.1177/0163443712468605', '10.1093/oso/9780190889760.001.0001', '10.1093/esr/jcu089', '10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328521', '10.1108/13563280510614483', '10.1093/hcr/hqx010']",Wiley

Grounding ourselves in the work of Indigenous scholars from North America and the Pacific, we propose a method of listening and attuning that can attend to the dislocation and abstraction often found in work addressing ecocide and environmental violence. Against the ubiquity of the case‐study approach, we propose a method we call “kin study,” which invites more embedded, expansive, material, and respectful relations to people and lands. This article frames the issues and then proposes, though a dialogue, how kin studies may be constituted and applied in studying environmental histories of the Pacific and Western Canada.","[('ANJA KANNGIESER', 'University of Wollongong  Australia'), ('ZOE TODD', 'Carleton University')]",[],Wiley
10.1111/ehr.12821,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,The gender division of labour in early modern England,[],"AbstractThis article presents new evidence of gendered work patterns in the pre‐industrial economy, providing an overview of women's work in early modern England. Evidence of 4,300 work tasks undertaken by particular women and men was collected from three types of court documents (coroners’ reports, church court depositions, and quarter sessions examinations) from five counties in south‐western England (Cornwall, Devon, Hampshire, Somerset, and Wiltshire) between 1500 and 1700. The findings show that women participated in all the main areas of the economy. However, different patterns of gendered work were identified in different parts of the economy: craft work showed a sharp division of labour and agriculture a flexible division of labour, while differences of gender were less pronounced in everyday commerce. Quantitative evidence of early modern housework and care work in England indicates that such work used less time and was less family‐based than is often assumed. Comparisons with gendered work patterns in early modern Germany and Sweden are drawn and show strong similarities to England. In conclusion it is argued that the gender division of labour cannot be explained by a single factor, as different influences were at play in different parts of the economy.","[('Jane Whittle', 'University of Exeter'), ('Mark Hailwood', 'University of Bristol')]","['10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190240615.001.0001', '10.1057/9780230250550', '10.12987/9780300156911', '10.2307/3180153', '10.1093/oso/9780195073904.001.0001', '10.9783/9780812200553', '10.1093/hwj/35.1.22', '10.1111/1468-0289.00054', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00486.x', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.1989.tb00501.x', '10.1080/03585522.2011.617576', '10.1111/hith.10673', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198201540.001.0001', '10.1017/jbr.2016.54', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199271320.001.0001', '10.7208/chicago/9780226355061.001.0001', '10.1111/j.1468-0424.2008.00535.x', '10.1525/9780520916944', '10.1515/9780773561250', '10.2307/jj.919480', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00588.x', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198205548.001.0001', '10.1111/1468-0424.12096', '10.1093/oso/9780199226252.001.0001', '10.1093/hwj/7.1.3', '10.3828/lhr.63.1.4', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.1995.tb01422.x', '10.1007/978-1-349-24456-0', '10.1080/09612021003634109', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00585.x', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199600793.001.0001', '10.1017/CHOL9780521431415.017', '10.1017/CBO9780511599446', '10.1007/978-1-349-02802-3', '10.1017/S0018246X9300001X', '10.1017/CBO9780511496110', '10.1017/S002205070800065X', '10.1017/S0080440105000332', '10.2752/175174211X12961586699685', '10.1515/9781787441378', '10.18356/152cdfb3-en']",Wiley

As the gas consumption is often dominated by the instructions that access the storage, Gasol uses the gas analysis to detect under-optimized storage patterns, and includes an (optional) automatic optimization of the selected function.

10.1093/pastj/gtaa001,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,"'FUNK MONEY': THE END OF EMPIRES, THE EXPANSION OF TAX HAVENS, AND DECOLONIZATION AS AN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EVENT",[],"Abstract This article explores the question of what happened to European assets in the process of decolonization. It argues that decolonization created a money panic of sorts that led white settlers, businessmen, and officials to seek to liquidate assets they owned and move funds out of the colonial world. Instead of being repatriated to metropolitan countries with high tax rates and exchange controls, money moved to tax havens. Decolonization thus provided an important share of early postwar tax haven business in a period when tax havens and offshore finance expanded during the 1950s and 1960s. In turn, the withdrawal of Euro-American investments from the decolonizing world set the stage for the politics of development and modernization in the coming decades. Ironically, the outflow of funds during decolonization and the subsequent return of some funds in restructured form as investments by multinational and other companies soon caused difficulties in newly independent developing countries. Companies soon found ways to rebook profits to have occurred in a tax haven rather than in the developing world, thus depriving low-income countries from tax revenue. The withdrawal of Euro-American investments from the colonial world during decolonization moreover had implications for the growth of portfolio investment, as funds removed from colonies were often invested through a tax haven onwards in US securities. All in all, decolonization was an economic and financial event that is only beginning to emerge in full detail.","[('Vanessa Ogle', 'University of California, Berkeley')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Archean granites define a continuum of compositions between several end members: (i) magmas that originated by partial melting of a range of crustal sources, from amphibolites to metasediments (‘C-type’ granitoids); and (ii) magmas that formed by partial melting of an enriched mantle source, the most common agent of enrichment being felsic (TTG) melts. Differences in the degree of metasomatism results in different primitive liquids for these ‘M-type’ granitoids. Mixed sources, differentiation and interactions between different melts resulted in a continuous range of compositions, defined by variable proportions of each end member. During the Archean, evolved crustal sources (sediments or felsic crust) and metasomatized mantle sources become increasingly more important, mirroring the progressive maturation of crustal segments and the stabilization of the global tectonic system.","[('Jean-François Moyen', '')]","['10.1016/j.lithos.2010.07.026', '10.1016/S0301-9268(00)00103-0',

Cretaceous third- and fourth-order hothouse sea-level changes, the sequence-stratigraphic framework, are linked to Milankovitch-type climate cycles, especially the longer-period sequence-building bands of 405 kyr and 1.2 myr. In the absence of continental ice sheets during Cretaceous hothouse phases (e.g. Cenomanian–Turonian), growing evidence indicates groundwater-related sea-level cycles: (1) the existence of Milankovitch-type humid-arid climate oscillations, proven via intense humid weathering records during times of regression and sea-level lowstands; (2) missing or inverse relationships of sea-level and the marine δ 18 O archives, i.e. the lack of a pronounced positive excursion, cooling signal during sea-level lowstands; and (3) the anti-phase relationship of sea and lake levels, attesting to high groundwater levels and charged continental aquifers during sea-level lowstands. This substantiates the aquifer-eustasy hypothesis. Rates of aquifer-eustatic sea-level change remain hard to decipher; however, reconstructions range from a very conservative minimum estimate of 0.04 mm a −1 (longer time intervals) to 0.7 mm a −1 (shorter, probably asymmetric cycles). Remarkably, aquifer-eustasy is recognized as a significant component for the Anthropocene sea-level budget.","[('Benjamin Sames', 'Department of Geodynamics and Sedimentology, University of Vienna, UZA 2, Althanstrasse 14, 1090 Vienna, Austria'), ('Benjamin Sames', 'Sam Noble Museum, University of Oklahoma, 2401 Chautauqua Ave, Norman, OK 73072, USA'), ('M.

In this article, we briefly respond to the critique of our work, further clarifying and refining our plea for clearly distinct conceptualizations of populism and nationalism in dialogue with the considerations formulated by Rogers Brubaker. More broadly, we see this response as a chance to contribute to the further development of a framework that allows for the rigorous study of populism's pivotal as well as complex and often troubling relation with nationalism.","[('Benjamin De Cleen', 'Department of Communication Studies Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussel  Belgium'), ('Yannis Stavrakakis', 'Department of Political Science Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki  Greece')]","['10.1080/13183222.2019.1606562', '10.1111/nana.12480', '10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7', '10.1111/nana.12522', '10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083', '10.1177/0032321719847576', '10.4324/9780203934753', '10.1080/17449057.2018.1532635', '10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001', '10.1080/13183222.2017.1330086', '10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001', '10.1111/1467-8675.12127', '10.1080/13183222.2017.1330087', '10.1080/17405904.2017.1309325', '10.1007/978-3-030-04621-7_2']",Wiley

Primary I-type granites represent fractionated liquids from intermediate magma systems of broadly andesitic composition. Fluid-fluxed melting of igneous rocks that resided in the continental crust generates secondary I-type granites. The former are directly related to subduction, with Cordilleran batholiths as the most characteristic examples. Experiments with lower crust granulite sources, in the presence of water, show that amphibole is formed by a water-fluxed peritectic rehydration melting reaction . Entrainment of only 10% of restites composed of amphibole, pyroxene, plagioclase and magnetite, is sufficient to account for discrepancies in aluminium saturation index and maficity in secondary I-type granites. Lower crust granulite xenoliths, attached to a sanukitoid containing 6 wt% water, have been used in two-layer capsules to test fluid-fluxed melting reactions as the origin of secondary I-type granites. It is proposed that sanukitoid magmas act as water donors that trigger extensive melting of the lower crust, giving rise to granodioritic liquids.

Tectonism started with the formation of a Tonian passive margin on a Baltica-derived ribbon dispersed into the Mirovoi Ocean. Obduction of an oceanic terrane onto the ribbon produced olistostromes, deformation and metamorphism before 750 Ma. Obduction was followed by a Tonian (750–730 Ma) arc on the created composite crust. A pause in magmatism between 730 and 700 Ma is the next event. Subsequently, a Cyrogenian (700–670 Ma) arc was formed, which may have collided with Baltica or another buoyant element nearby. Thereafter, a long-lasting (640–565 Ma) continental arc was erected which, combined with the late Ediacaran–Early Paleozoic sedimentary cover, represents the hallmark of West Avalonia. A Caribbean-style incursion of the Ediacaran arc into the widening Tornquist gap between Amazonia and Baltica led to a diachronous collision with the Ganderian arc. Strike-slip slivering produced a complex transfer of terranes to both: Carolinia and smaller terranes to Ganderia, and East Avalonia to West Avalonia. The Rheic Ocean opened diachronously at c. 500 Ma, following a plate reorganization and re-establishment of an oblique subduction zone beneath Amazonia. As a result, Avalonia and Ganderia became progressively separated and dispersed into the Iapetus Ocean.","[('C.

The competition is an annual comparative evaluation of fully automatic software verifiers for C and Java programs. The objective is to provide an overview of the state of the art in terms of effectiveness and efficiency of software verification, establish standards, provide a platform for exchange to developers of such tools, educate PhD students on reproducibility approaches and benchmarking, and provide computing resources to developers that do not have access to compute clusters. The competition consisted of 15 648 verification tasks for C programs and 586 verification tasks for Java programs. Each verification task consisted of a program and a property (reachability, memory safety, overflows, termination). The new category on data-race detection was introduced as demonstration category.

The recently determined Bajocian age for salt deposition (using 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopes) is integrated by modifying the plate kinematic framework with a new Equatorial Atlantic reconstruction that expands the gap between the Americas by 180 km over many kinematic frameworks. NW–SE synrift lithospheric extension along western Florida–Bahamas is estimated at 40%, implying thinned continental crust beneath Great Bank, Bahamas, the conjugate for the Guianas Basin margin. In cordilleran Mexico (excluding the Yucatán Block), we propose two new means by which continental crust migrated into the ‘Colombian overlap position’ of Pangaean reconstructions. The first involved Jurassic–earliest Cretaceous sinistral displacement of the Oaxaca Block along a NW–SE ‘North Oaxaca Transfer’ through or adjacent to the Cuicateco Belt. The second applies to the continental crust in eastern Mexico to the north of Cuicateco, a region we refer to as ‘peninsular Mexico’. There, most Mesozoic basement faults trend NW–SE, and the common occurrence of Permian mid-crustal anatectic basement directly beneath Mesozoic red beds, salt and marine strata suggests extreme extension prior to the onset of sedimentation. Because these Mesozoic sedimentary sections typically sum to 3–8 km in thickness, the post-rift crust of peninsular Mexico probably averaged about 25 km in thickness before later orogenesis. Our reconstructions suggest that this Triassic–Middle Jurassic extension approached 100%, beginning with overthickened Alleghanian (Permian) crust about 50 km in thickness in palaeo-northern Mexico, and was accompanied by a significant sinistral component broadly distributed across the rift array. The updated model provides an exploration and kinematic framework for the entire region.","[('James Pindell', 'Tectonic Analysis Ltd, Chestnut House, Burton Park, Duncton, West Sussex GU28 0LH, UK'), ('James Pindell', 'Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, TX 77005, USA'), ('Diego Villagómez', 'Tectonic Analysis Ltd, Chestnut House, Burton Park, Duncton, West Sussex GU28 0LH, UK'), ('Diego Villagómez', 'Department of Earth Sciences, University of Geneva, 13 rue des Maraîchers, 1205 Geneva, Switzerland'), ('Roberto Molina-Garza', 'Centro de Geociencias, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), Boulevard Juriquilla No. 3001, Querétaro, Mexico'), ('Rod Graham', 'Department of Geology, Imperial College, Prince Consort Road, Kensington, London SW7 2BP, UK'), ('Bodo Weber', 'Departamento de Geología, División de Ciencias de la Tierra, Centro de Investigación Científica y de Educación Superior de Ensenada (CICESE), Carretera Ensenada-Tijuana 3918, Zona Playitas, 22860 Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico')]","['10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024<0443:RAKEFM>2.3.CO;2', '10.1130/G25240A.1', '10.1130/0016-7606(1983)94<941:TEOMAA>2.0.CO;2', '10.1016/j.epsl.2014.03.047', '10.1016/j.jsames.2007.08.003', '10.1130/GES00545.1', '10.1306/M79877C20', '10.1038/s41598-020-64333-5', '10.1186/BF03352621', '10.1016/j.jsames.2009.10.005', '10.1080/00206814.2014.963710', '10.1306/M75768C13', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.08.007', '10.1098/rsta.1965.0020', '10.1002/9781444347166.ch19', '10.1139/e83-094', '10.1029/2002TC001367', '10.1306/M75768C1', '10.18268/BSGM2005v57n1a2', '10.18814/epiiugs/2013/v36i3/002', '10.1130/MEM153-p7', '10.1130/SPE.S.12296039', '10.1111/bre.12299', '10.1139/e92-125', '10.1144/gsjgs.139.4.0371', '10.1029/TC004i001p00071', '10.1029/TC005i004p00703', '10.1016/S0895-9811(01)00046-3', '10.1029/JB075i026p04939', '10.1002/2014JB011311', '10.1144/SP504-2020-14', '10.1080/00206814.2012.685553', '10.1016/B978-0-444-42903-2.50038-5', '10.1190/1.1605081', '10.1130/GES00759.1', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.03.002', '10.2113/gssgfbull.179.2.147', '10.1038/232020a0', '10.1029/2019TC005540', '10.1016/B978-044452748-6/00097-3', '10.1029/94JB01889', '10.1017/CBO9780511536045', '10.1306/M75768C7', '10.1130/2008.fld014(01)', '10.1144/GSL.SP.1987.028.01.12', '10.5194/se-4-215-2013', '10.1306/M79877C8', '10.1306/11151817405', '10.1306/04011312073', '10.5724/gcs.05.25.1151', '10.1016/S0301-9268(02)00166-3', '10.1130/DNAG-GNA-M.351', '10.1029/JB089iB09p07753', '10.1016/j.cageo.2012.06.019', '10.1016/j.epsl.2010.06.024', '10.1130/0016-7606(1976)87<969:RMOSAW>2.0.CO;2', '10.1016/0009-2541(88)90144-1', '10.1098/rsos.140184', '10.1016/S0301-9268(98)00108-9', '10.1130/L658.1', '10.1130/B30827.1', '10.1016/j.jsames.2019.102229', '10.1007/s11001-019-09379-5', '10.1016/0191-8141(89)90036-9', '10.1029/95JB00763', '10.1111/jmg.12285', '10.1016/j.lithos.2012.04.021', '10.1130/GES01055.1', '10.1080/00206819409465475', '10.1130/0091-7613(1984)12<103:HORAAA>2.0.CO;2', '10.1016/0012-821X(78)90071-7', '10.1029/1998TC900030', '10.1130/0016-7606(1992)104<1156:POTCMS>2.3.CO;2', '10.1130/L409.1', '10.1016/j.tecto.2017.11.026', '10.22201/cgeo.20072902e.2019.3.1048', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.102903', '10.1023/A:1024566803893', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.08.001', '10.1029/96JB01781', '10.1029/2018GC007584', '10.1190/INT-2015-0110.1', '10.1016/j.jsames.2006.07.002', '10.5724/gcs.15.35.0001', '10.1016/j.jsames.2018.11.014', '10.1016/j.chemer.2019.05.004', '10.1080/00206814.2013.844313', '10.1130/0091-7613(1995)023<1127:OAPMAT>2.3.CO;2', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.03.006', '10.1007/s00531-013-0933-1', '10.1029/TC004i001p00001', '10.5724/gcs.14.33.0131', '10.1029/TC001i002p00179', '10.5724/gcs.01.21.0193', '10.5724/gcs.07.27.0146', '10.1144/SP328.1', '10.1016/0040-1951(88)90262-4', '10.2110/pec.98.58.0045', '10.1080/00206814.2010.510008', '10.1111/bre.12059', '10.1130/2020.2546(12)', '10.1016/0883-2927(87)90006-0', '10.1029/JB084iB11p05973', '10.1144/SP328.11', '10.1190/INT-2014-0246.1', '10.1111/bre.12043', '10.1144/SP476.6', '10.1029/92TC02641', '10.1130/DNAG-GNA-J.131', '10.1017/S0022336000002985', '10.1126/science.1258213', '10.2113/gselements.7.4.229', '10.1127/njgpa/225/2002/1', '10.1130/0016-7606(1984)95<226:DSDPLS>2.0.CO;2', '10.1130/0091-7613(1994)022<0507:MSTTOO>2.3.CO;2', '10.1130/DNAG-GNA-I2.329', '10.2110/jsr.2016.45', '10.1016/j.gr.2014.06.005', '10.1017/9781108292795', '10.1016/S0040-1951(03)00025-8', '10.1016/j.gr.2014.06.004', '10.5724/gcs.01.21.0129', '10.1130/0016-7606(1987)98<249:STATSM>2.0.CO;2', '10.1029/95JB00191', '10.1130/G36798.1', '10.1016/j.gr.2015.01.011', '10.1016/j.gr.2018.09.007', '10.1016/j.gr.2020.02.007', '10.1016/j.lithos.2011.05.003', '10.2747/0020-6814.47.5.509', '10.1007/s00531-006-0093-7', '10.1016/j.precamres.2010.07.007', '10.1016/j.lithos.2017.12.009', '10.1130/0-8137-2380-9.15', '10.1002/9781444303834.ch9']",Geological Society of London
10.1111/nana.12663,NATIONS AND NATIONALISM,0603 World History; 0304 Ethnology; 0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,Nationalism and populism on the left: The case of Podemos,[],"AbstractThis article provides an empirical exploration of the relation between nationalism and populism on the left of the political spectrum. The Spanish party Podemos is a key case study for such an analysis, as it is a left‐populist actor that has made extensive use of nationalist rhetoric in its discourse. Through a discourse analysis on a corpus that includes speeches by Podemos leadership and primary data such as interviews and original unpublished material, this article studies the nationalist dimension of Podemos and its relation with the party's much‐discussed populism. The analysis shows that the Podemos leadership deliberately embeds nationalism in its populist strategy: Nationalism is a central element of the party's populist project and serves to advance an alternative form of national identification that challenges that of the right wing. Through a resignification of national pride and belonging, Podemos constructs an image of Spain that refers to an inclusive welfare state, to people's mobilization, and to a moral community that is not delimited by lingual or ethnic particularisms.","[('Jacopo Custodi', 'Faculty of Political and Social Sciences Scuola Normale Superiore  Florence Italy')]","['10.1080/13183222.2019.1606562', '10.4324/9781315226446-4', '10.1080/23745118.2019.1632576', '10.1080/17449057.2018.1532633', '10.1111/nana.12480', '10.1080/1362102042000214705', '10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7', '10.17141/iconos.52.2015.1670', '10.1075/jlp.6.2.08car', '10.1007/978-3-319-63826-3_10', '10.1177/03058298830120020701', '10.1111/newe.12001', '10.1111/1467-923X.12321', '10.4324/9781351022668', '10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083', '10.1111/nana.12575', '10.1093/esr/jcu087', '10.1007/978-3-319-63432-6_6', '10.1177/0032329208316570', '10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog114', '10.1080/13569319808420771', '10.1002/9781444355093.ch24', '10.21308/recp.44.09', '10.1111/1467-9248.00165', '10.1108/9781839092039', '10.1007/978-3-319-63432-6_1', '10.4324/9780203934753', '10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.02050.x', '10.1007/978-3-319-63826-3_11', '10.1017/CCOL0521439612', '10.1057/9780230523364', '10.2307/j.ctv1fx4gx6', '10.4324/9781315180823', '10.1080/13183222.2017.1330087', '10.1080/13569317.2016.1150136', '10.1080/17449057.2010.507114', '10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001', '10.1007/978-3-319-47479-3', '10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001', '10.1093/icon/mom039', '10.1080/01419870.2015.1009480', '10.1080/0969229042000249831', '10.1177/0032321716647400', '10.5565/rev/papers.2222', '10.1075/jlp.17025.sta', '10.1080/17405904.2017.1309325']",Wiley
10.1093/jsh/shy118,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,The Emmet's Inch: Small History in a Digital Age,[],"Abstract Digitization has usually been considered a facilitator of what has been called “big” history. While digital history projects increasingly make good and sensitive use of individual and granular records and use them to bring human complexity into a larger analysis, the digitization of published material and archives have mostly been discussed by historians in aggregate: they are valued chiefly for their ability to give us “big data” about phenomena in the past. Yet for those interested in questions and methodologies of microhistory, biographical history, history from below, and other kinds of what we might call “small” history, the digitization of archives and individual records is an equally transformative development. This article will examine the way that digitization has changed how historians discover, concatenate, and communicate small stories in their narratives and arguments. I will consider the practice and the ethics of telling and digitizing individual histories, and I will suggest some different ways of dealing with the new boundaries—and boundlessness—that the “mass digitized turn” throws up, particularly for historians working in the period after 1800. Finally, amidst an increased emphasis on digitization and big data in the field of history, I want to assert the continuing power of all kinds of small histories to explain the past and to connect it to our present, and ourselves.","[('Julia Laite', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

The first is the revival of Tsarist imperial nationalist and White Russian émigré nationalist denials of the existence of Ukraine and Ukrainians. Russian imperial nationalists believe the eastern Slavs constitute a pan Russian nation of Great Russians, Little Russians and White Russian branches of one Russian nation. The second is the cult of the Great Patriotic War and Joseph Stalin and the revival of Soviet era discourse on Ukrainian Nazis (i.e., nationalists). A Ukrainian nationalist in the Soviet Union and Vladimir Putin's Russia is any Ukrainian who seeks a future for his/her country outside the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Russian World and who upholds an ethnic Ukrainian (rather than a Little Russian) identity. The Russian World is the new core of the Eurasian Economic Union, Russian President Vladimir Putin's alternative to the EU's Eastern Partnership. In the contemporary domain, Ukrainian nationalists are Nazi's irrespective of their language preference or political beliefs and if they do not accept they are Little Russians. Putin's invasion goal of denazification is a genocidal goal to eradicate the ‘anti‐Russia’ that has allegedly been nurtured by Ukrainian nationalists and the West.","[('Taras Kuzio', 'Department of Political Science National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy  Kyiv Ukraine')]","['10.1515/9781474410434-006', '10.2747/1060-586X.19.4.289', '10.1016/j.postcomstud.2017.10.001', '10.1080/13518046.2019.1684002', '10.1016/j.postcomstud.2019.10.007', '10.1080/15387216.2019.1703777', '10.1080/1060586X.2015.1023004', '10.1016/j.postcomstud.2016.01.002', '10.1080/09668136.2020.1862060']",Wiley

Their generation is intimately related to crustal thickening and the active deformation and metamorphism of metapelites. Data from Proterozoic to present day orogenic belts show that collisional leucogranites (CLGs) are peraluminous, with muscovite, biotite and tourmaline as characteristic minerals. Isotopic ratios uniquely identify the metapelitic sequences in which CLGs occur as sources. Organic material in pelitic sources results in f O 2 in CLGs that is usually below the fayalite–magnetite–quartz buffer. Most CLGs form under vapour-poor conditions with melting involving a peritectic breakdown of muscovite. The low concentrations of Mg, Fe and Ti that characterize CLGs are largely related to biotite–melt equilibria in the source rocks. Concentrations of Zr, Th and rare earth elements are lower than expected from zircon and monazite saturation models because these minerals often remain enclosed in residual biotite during melting. Melting involving muscovite may limit the temperatures achieved in the source regions. A lack of nearby mantle heat sources in thick collisional orogens has led to thermal models for the generation of CLGs that involve flux melting, or large amounts of radiogenic heat generation, or decompression melting or shear heating, the last one emphasizing the link of leucogranites and their sources to crustal-scale shear zone systems.","[('Peter I.

10.1017/S1740022820000029,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Slavery and the new history of capitalism,[],"AbstractThe new history of capitalism (NHC) places a great deal of emphasis on slavery as a crucial world institution. Slavery, it is alleged, arose out of, and underpinned, capitalist development. This article starts by showing the intellectual and scholarly foundations of some of the broad conclusions of the NHC. It proceeds by arguing that capitalist transformation must rely on a global framework of analysis. The article considers three critiques in relation to the NHC. First, the NHC overemphasizes the importance of coercion to economic growth in the eighteenth century. We argue that what has been called ‘war capitalism’ might be better served by an analysis in which the political economy of European states and empires, rather than coercion, is a key factor in the transformation of capitalism at a global scale. Second, in linking slavery to industrialization, the NHC proposes a misleading chronology. Cotton produced in large quantities in the United States came too late to cause an Industrial Revolution which, we argue, developed gradually from the latter half of the seventeenth century and which was well established by the 1790s, when cotton started to arrive from the American South. During early industrialization, sugar, not cotton, was the main plantation crop in the Americas. Third, the NHC is overly concentrated on production and especially on slave plantation economies. It underplays the ‘power of consumption’, where consumers came to purchase increasing amounts of plantation goods, including sugar, rice, indigo, tobacco, cotton, and coffee. To see slavery’s role in fostering the preconditions of industrialization and the Great Divergence, we must tell a story about slavery’s place in supporting the expansion of consumption, as well as a story about production","[('Trevor Burnard', ''), ('Giorgio Riello', '')]",[],Cambridge University Press (CUP)
10.1111/hith.12190,HISTORY AND THEORY,0603 World History,HISTORICAL FUTURES,[],"ABSTRACTThis article outlines the agenda of a collective research project that aims to explore modalities of historical futures that constitute our current historical condition. To present the collective work adequately, we have teamed up with History and Theory and initiated a long‐term serial publishing experiment. In the coming years, each issue of the journal will feature contributions to this research endeavor. In our project‐opening piece, we briefly introduce the experiment and the premises of the collective research agenda. We begin by recounting the many ways in which increasingly towering novel future prospects have begun to capture the scholarly world's attention across disciplinary boundaries. We then introduce the notion of historical futures. Crediting theoretical inspirations and paying intellectual debts to conceptual relatives, we define “historical futures” as the plurality of transitional relations between apprehensions of the past and anticipated futures. At the core of the article, we formulate our call for a collective investigation of modalities of historical futures and sketch three basic sets of concerns that the explorative works in this experiment may address: kinds of transitions from past to futures, kinds of anticipatory practices, and kinds of registers as interpretive tools that position such practices on a variety of spectrums between two poles (for instance, a value register with the poles of catastrophic and redemptive futures). Finally, we close with a brief note about the necessity of collective endeavors.","[('ZOLTÁN BOLDIZSÁR SIMON', 'Bielefeld University and Leiden University'), ('MAREK TAMM', 'Tallinn University')]",[],Wiley

In recent years, major advances have been made in our genetic understanding of the Justinianic Plague. Yet growing scientific interest in the disease has coincided with a concerted effort amongst some historians to seek to downplay its historical importance. This article surveys our current state of historical and scientific understanding with respect to the sixth-century pandemic, responds to the recent attempts to argue that the disease had only a minimal impact on the societies that it struck, and considers how historians should respond to the burgeoning scientific evidence in order to take study of the plague forward. For co-operation between geneticists, environmental scientists, archaeologists and historians, it argues, offers the chance to transform our understanding of how, when and where the plague spread and to assess its impact across the Afro-Eurasian world as a whole, and not just on the Mediterranean, for which we have our best written sources.","[('Peter Sarris', 'Trinity College, Cambridge')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

10.1111/ehr.12962,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Slavery and Anglo-American capitalism revisited,[],"AbstractBritish and American debates on the relationship between slavery and economic growth have had little interaction with each other. This article attempts intellectual arbitrage by joining these two literatures. The linkage turns on the neglected part two of the ‘Williams thesis’: that slavery and the slave trade, once vital for the expansion of British industry and commerce, were no longer needed by the nineteenth century. In contrast to recent assertions of the centrality of slavery for US economic development, the article argues that part two of the Williams thesis applies with equal force to nineteenth‐century America. Unlike sugar, cotton required no large investments of fixed capital and could be cultivated efficiently at any scale, in locations that would have been settled by free farmers in the absence of slavery. Cheap cotton was undoubtedly important for the growth of textiles, but cheap cotton did not require slavery. The best evidence for this claim is that after two decades of war, abolition, and Reconstruction, cotton prices returned to their prewar levels. In both countries, the rise of anti‐slavery sentiment was not driven by the prospect of direct economic benefits, but major economic interest groups acquiesced in abolition because they no longer saw slavery as indispensable.","[('Gavin Wright', 'Stanford University')]","['10.1257/0002828054201305', '10.2307/1888272', '10.1017/CBO9781107050822', '10.9783/9780812293098', '10.2307/204282', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2008.00438.x', '10.2307/2210413', '10.1086/683036', '10.1017/ssh.2017.39', '10.1017/S0022050700019574', '10.1017/S002205070006544X', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.1962.tb02239.x', '10.1017/S0022050700078566', '10.1093/oso/9780195093469.001.0001', '10.2307/204654', '10.4159/harvard.9780674735620', '10.1017/S0022050700024670', '10.1515/9781400831883', '10.2307/2568431', '10.1017/S0022050717000493', '10.1017/S0022050700011943', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00414.x', '10.7228/manchester/9780719091834.001.0001', '10.1017/S0022050700016466', '10.1017/S0022050700006641', '10.1017/S0022050700011396', '10.1017/S0022050700015023', '10.1017/S002205071700016X', '10.7228/manchester/9780719091834.003.0003', '10.7591/cornell/9780801451089.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9780511583940', '10.1016/0014-4983(88)90003-4', '10.4159/harvard.9780674181304', '10.2307/j.ctvjsf5q7', '10.4159/9780674973817', '10.1126/science.364.6435.16', '10.1111/ehr.12696', '10.2307/1919050', '10.56021/9780801873942', '10.1515/9781400880348', '10.2307/2597624', '10.9783/9780812293098-005', '10.2307/3124830', '10.1017/CHOL9780521394420.007', '10.1017/CBO9780511512124.012', '10.7312/myer93866', '10.9783/9780812208313', '10.1017/CBO9780511523892.010', '10.1017/S1740022806000076', '10.1017/S0147547915000393', '10.1017/S0022050708000831', '10.1016/j.eeh.2017.12.002', '10.37234/HVKPEXAZ', '10.4159/harvard.9780674435025', '10.1017/S0022050700047409', '10.1017/CBO9780511812385', '10.1017/CBO9780511523892.012', '10.1017/CBO9781139198868', '10.1093/jahist/jaw316', '10.4159/9780674988590', '10.1017/S0022050710000537', '10.12987/yale/9780300192001.001.0001', '10.1017/9781139226585', '10.2307/3125182', '10.1057/9780230513600', '10.1080/00076799500000003', '10.3386/w25197', '10.1017/S0022050700030291', '10.1017/S0022050700017927', '10.1017/CBO9780511778575', '10.5149/northcarolina/9781469624242.001.0001', '10.1017/S0022050700081778', '10.1017/S0022050700033593', '10.1017/S0022050700040134', '10.2307/2598081']",Wiley
10.1093/pastj/gtz061,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,"PETITIONS, PARLIAMENT AND POLITICAL CULTURE: PETITIONING THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, 1780-1918",[],"Abstract This article analyses nearly one million petitions received by the House of Commons to reveal a culture of petitioning that recast the political culture of modern Britain and Ireland. It argues, first, that petitions provided a much more regular and continuous form of interaction between people and Parliament than elections. Second, petitioning–meaning the practices associated with the drafting, signing and presentation of petitions–enabled a vibrant, performative public politics. Third, petitions and petitioning were relatively open, inclusive forms of political participation since all British subjects enjoyed the formal right to petition. We examine the role of formidable campaigns of mass mobilisation, but also humble appeals of marginalised individuals. Our data has significant implications for our understanding of the nationalisation, organisation, and popularisation of politics in this period. We argue that attention to petitions helps us to decentre parliamentary elections as the principal connection between local and national politics. Indeed, petitioners responded to the shifting boundaries between the central and devolved state in deciding to which authorities they would direct petitions. Petitioning campaigns pioneered the mass, organised, national movements that would gradually emerge as the hallmark of stronger political parties. This did not undermine petitioning. However, the consequent growth of disciplined parties strengthened executive power, at the expense of parliamentary government, redirected petitions from the Commons. Furthermore, the continuing expansion of petitioning alongside extensions of the franchise suggests that petitions did not function as an ersatz ballot. Rather, petitions and debates between parliamentarians and petitioners over the meaning of growing lists of signatories suggest that petitioning catalysed a range of other forms of participation and hence forged an ever more popular politics.","[('Richard Huzzey', ''), ('Henry Miller', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

During such crises, the ordinary and unnoticed routines that structure everyday life are thrust into the spotlight as people struggle to maintain or recreate a sense of normalcy. Drawing on a range of cases including China, Russia, the UK, and USA, we examine three categories of everyday practice during the COVID-19 pandemic that respond to disruptions in daily routines and seek a return to national normality: performing national solidarities and exclusions by wearing face masks; consuming the nation in the form of panic buying and conspiracy theories; and enforcing foreign policies through social media and embodiment. This analysis thus breaks with existing works on everyday nationalism and banal nationalism that typically focus on pervasively unnoticed forms of nationalism during settled times, and it challenges approaches to contentious politics that predict protest mobilization for change rather than restoration of the status quo ante.

10.1093/pastj/gtaa018,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,HOW DID THE FEUDAL ECONOMY WORK? THE ECONOMIC LOGIC OF MEDIEVAL SOCIETIES,[],"Abstract This article aims to create a model for the underlying economic logic of the feudal economy, which can then be contrasted with the much better-known models for the capitalist economy. It does so by developing a discussion of a very frequent pattern in pre-industrial, feudal, societies: active local economies with highly developed exchange, which never, even remotely, developed in the direction of capitalism. It is argued here that this is because they obeyed a different economic logic, rather than just a simpler version of the logic of the capitalist world, which was somehow ‘blocked’ from developing any further. The article then sets out the basic elements of what that logic could be.","[('Chris Wickham', 'University of Oxford, University of Birmingham')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)
10.1111/ehr.13019,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,"An introduction to the history of infectious diseases, epidemics and the early phases of the long-run decline in mortality",[],"AbstractThis article, written during the COVID‐19 epidemic, provides a general introduction to the long‐term history of infectious diseases, epidemics and the early phases of the spectacular long‐term improvements in life expectancy since 1750, primarily with reference to English history. The story is a fundamentally optimistic one. In 2019 global life expectancy was approaching 73 years. In 1800 it was probably about 30. To understand the origins of this transition, we have to look at the historical sequence by which so many causes of premature death have been vanquished over time. In England that story begins much earlier than often supposed, in the years around 1600. The first two ‘victories’ were over famine and plague. However, economic changes with negative influences on mortality meant that, despite this, life expectancies were either falling or stable between the late sixteenth and mid eighteenth centuries. The late eighteenth and early nineteenth century saw major declines in deaths from smallpox, malaria and typhus and the beginnings of the long‐run increases in life expectancy. The period also saw urban areas become capable of demographic growth without a constant stream of migrants from the countryside: a necessary precondition for the global urbanization of the last two centuries and for modern economic growth. Since 1840 the highest national life expectancy globally has increased by three years in every decade.","[('Leigh Shaw‐Taylor', 'Senior Lecturer in History, Faculty of History; Co‐director of the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure University of Cambridge')]","['10.1093/ereh/het013', '10.1017/9781316841235', '10.1017/S0022050717000092', '10.1093/oso/9780198805830.001.0001', '10.2307/2594881', '10.2307/2595837', '10.1111/ehr.12573', '10.1017/CBO9781139031110', '10.1017/CBO9781316424032', '10.1111/ehr.12098', '10.1111/ehr.12964', '10.1111/ehr.12112', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00599.x', '10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.04.019', '10.1080/1081602X.2018.1525755', '10.1017/CBO9780511581847', '10.1016/j.cub.2016.10.061', '10.3998/mpub.14163', '10.1017/CBO9780511975912', '10.1017/CBO9780511817649', '10.1111/ehr.12942', '10.2307/2598176', '10.1080/1081602X.2013.870491', '10.1111/1468-0289.00160', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2006.00364.x', '10.1515/9781782043690', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00510.x', '10.1017/9781316841235.007', '10.1111/1468-0289.12023', '10.1017/CBO9780511523403', '10.2307/2594969', '10.1017/CBO9780511895494', '10.1515/9781580468718', '10.1186/s12879-019-3750-8', '10.1515/9781400829897', '10.1126/science.1069675', '10.2307/2594505', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00620.x', '10.1017/CBO9781316036495', '10.1111/ehr.12097', '10.1093/oso/9780198283287.001.0001', '10.2307/2595884', '10.1017/CBO9780511599446', '10.1111/1468-0289.00084', '10.1017/S0022050700034549', '10.1017/CBO9780511496127', '10.1017/CBO9780511660344']",Wiley

The observations suggest that these salt basins shared a common evolution. Crustal faulting gradually shifted basinward. Consequent thermal/loading subsidence plus lower-crustal thinning generated basinward-shifting accommodation for sag sequences, but slow sedimentation relative to subsidence resulted in deep depressions. A switch to symmetrical boudinage of thinned crust created the troughs and possible reactive mantle diapirs.

The technique aims to fix the logic of the network at an intermediate layer or at the last layer. NNrepair first uses fault localization to find potentially faulty network parameters (such as the weights) and then performs repair using constraint solving to apply small modifications to the parameters to remedy the defects. We present novel strategies to enable precise yet efficient repair such as inferring correctness specifications to act as oracles for intermediate layer repair, and generation of experts for each class. We demonstrate the technique in the context of three different scenarios: (1) Improving the overall accuracy of a model, (2) Fixing security vulnerabilities caused by poisoning of training data and (3) Improving the robustness of the network against adversarial attacks. Our evaluation on MNIST and CIFAR-10 models shows that NNrepair can improve the accuracy by 45.56% points on poisoned data and 10.40% points on adversarial data. NNrepair also provides small improvement in the overall accuracy of models, without requiring new data or re-training.","[('Muhammad Usman', ''), ('Divya Gopinath', ''), ('Youcheng Sun', ''), ('Yannic Noller', ''), ('Corina S.

Evidence from Reconstruction,[],"This paper exploits the history of Reconstruction after the American Civil War to estimate the effect of politician race on public finance. While the effect of black politicians is positive and significant, black officials may be endogenous to electoral preferences for redistribution. I therefore use the number of free blacks in the antebellum era (1860) as an instrument for black political leaders during Reconstruction. Instrumental variables (IV) estimates show that an additional black official increased per capita county tax revenue by $0.20, more than an hour’s wage at the time. The effect was not persistent, however, disappearing entirely once black politicians were removed from office at Reconstruction’s end. Consistent with the stated policy objectives of black officials, I find positive effects of black politicians on land tenancy and black literacy. These results suggest that black political leaders had large effects on public finance and individual outcomes over and above electoral preferences.","[('Trevon D.

First, it reviews recent literature calling for a revised and extended history of work. Based on that review, it then explores the possibility of a new, empirically based analytical and methodological framework for the study of labor relations and the reinterpretation of contemporary issues, including precariousness, “modern slavery,” social inequality, and dependence. We contend that viewing labor relations as standardly diverse, coexisting, entangled, and overlapping across history provides an alternative organizing principle for the research field and is central to the understanding of larger social processes. To this end, we propose a contextualized, interrelational and transepochal approach to labor relations and labor experiences and discuss the potential of three research strategies: the analysis of the historical semantics of labor relations, the detailed study of coercion, and the historical investigation of the relation between precariousness and flexibility.","[('Christian G De Vito', ''), ('Juliane Schiel', ''), ('Matthias van Rossum', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

These boundary commissions were the largest ever sent to the Americas and coincided with broader imperial reforms enacted throughout the hemisphere. Where Caciques and Mapmakers Met considers what these efforts meant to Indigenous peoples whose lands the border crossed. Moving beyond common frameworks that assess mapped borders strictly via colonial law or Native sovereignty, it examines the interplay between imperial and Indigenous spatial imaginaries. What results is an intricate spatial history of border making in southeastern South America (present-day Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay) with global implications. Drawing upon manuscripts from over two dozen archives in seven countries, Jeffrey Erbig traces on-the-ground interactions between Ibero-American colonists, Jesuit and Guaraní mission-dwellers, and autonomous Indigenous peoples as they responded to ever-changing notions of territorial possession. It reveals that Native agents shaped when and where the border was drawn, and fused it to their own territorial claims. While mapmakers' assertions of Indigenous disappearance or subjugation shaped historiographical imaginaries thereafter, Erbig reveals that the formation of a border was contingent upon Native engagement and authority.","[('Jeffrey Alan Jr. Erbig', '')]",[],University of North Carolina Press

Developing cross-section-scale understanding of these systems necessitates structural interpretation. However, over the past several decades a false distinction has arisen between some forms of so-called fault-related folding and buckle folding. We investigate the origins of this confusion and seek to develop unified approaches for interpreting fold–thrust belts that incorporate deformation arising both from the amplification of buckling instabilities and from localized shear failures (thrust faults). Discussions are illustrated using short case studies from the Bolivian Subandean chain (Incahuasi anticline), the Canadian Cordillera (Livingstone anticlinorium) and Subalpine chains of France and Switzerland. Only fault–bend folding is purely fault-related and other forms, such as fault-propagation and detachment folds, all involve components of buckling. Better integration of understanding of buckling processes, the geometries and structural evolutions that they generate may help to understand how deformation is distributed within fold–thrust belts.

In this paper, we claim that studying the global history of capitalism through the lens of commodity frontiers and using commodity regimes as an analytical framework is crucial to understanding the origins and nature of capitalism, and thus the modern world. We argue that commodity frontiers identify capitalism as a process rooted in a profound restructuring of the countryside and nature. They connect processes of extraction and exchange with degradation, adaptation and resistance in rural peripheries. To account for the enormous variety of actors and places involved in this history is a critical challenge in the social sciences, and one to which global history can contribute crucial insights.","[('Sven Beckert', ''), ('Ulbe Bosma', ''), ('Mindi Schneider', ''), ('Eric Vanhaute', '')]",[],Cambridge University Press (CUP)
10.1111/johs.12259,JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,A Theory of Capitalist Slavery,[],"AbstractThe relationship between slavery and capitalism has become a renewed topic of debate, yet scholars have not been able to agree on a definition of capitalism. In this article I first clear up some misconceptions and situate the debate in the Marxian tradition from which it arose. I argue that while non‐Marxian accounts of capitalism fail to explain the key social transformations that have accompanied the rise of capitalism globally, Marxian accounts have failed to comprehend similar transformations that occurred on American slave plantations in the 19th century. I then present a general model of capitalism, building on earlier work by Brenner and Wood, that both incorporates and explains the distinctive dynamics of capitalist slavery in the antebellum South.","[('John Clegg', '')]","['10.1006/exeh.2000.0762', '10.2307/1888272', '10.1163/156920611X592364', '10.1080/01615449909598939', '10.1093/jahist/jau357', '10.1016/j.jce.2012.04.001', '10.1017/S0020859017000190', '10.1093/past/70.1.30', '10.1093/past/97.1.16', '10.5871/bacad/9780197264034.003.0004', '10.1086/683036', '10.1017/ssh.2017.39', '10.1017/S0021875818000464', '10.1086/258020', '10.1093/oso/9780195160406.001.0001', '10.2307/3124246', '10.1017/S1467222700007291', '10.1017/S0022050700076439', '10.1016/S1045-2354(03)00102-3', '10.1017/S0022050700099496', '10.1080/14664650008567022', '10.7208/chicago/9780226279473.001.0001', '10.2307/2702146', '10.1111/j.1467-6281.2010.00306.x', '10.2307/2587364', '10.1353/cwh.2019.0015', '10.4159/9780674039155', '10.2307/j.ctvjsf5q7', '10.1017/CBO9780511815393', '10.1017/S0022050700033866', '10.1515/9781400880348', '10.1111/j.1536-7150.1961.tb00791.x', '10.1017/S0022050715000996', '10.1163/9789004326071', '10.1353/jer.2019.0029', '10.1017/S0147547915000393', '10.3386/w16494', '10.1016/j.eeh.2017.12.002', '10.1146/annurev.so.03.080177.002203', '10.1177/000271621003500105', '10.1163/ej.9789004201040.i-298', '10.1590/2236-463320181908', '10.18061/dsq.v32i3.3267', '10.1006/exeh.2000.0763', '10.1353/jer.2014.0043', '10.1215/00382876-2009-033', '10.1017/CBO9780511549793', '10.4159/9780674988590', '10.12987/yale/9780300192001.001.0001', '10.2307/2208625', '10.2307/2191238', '10.2307/2296714', '10.2307/1055766', '10.3386/w25197', '10.1016/0014-4983(75)90021-2']",Wiley

The effect of its hypothesized amalgamation is generally ignored in mantle convection models claiming the transition from Rodinia to Pangaea represents a single supercontinent cycle. We apply three geodynamic scenarios to Pannotia amalgamation that are tested using regional geology. Scenarios involving quasi-stationary mantle convection patterns are not supported by the geological record. A scenario involving feedback between the supercontinent cycle and global mantle convection patterns predicts upwellings beneath the Gondwanan portion of Pannotia and the arrival of plumes along the entire Gondwanan (but not Laurentian) margin beginning at c. 0.6 Ga. Such a scenario is compatible with regional geology, but the candidates for plume magmatism we propose require testing by detailed geochemical and isotopic studies. If verified, this scenario could provide geodynamic explanations for the origins of the late Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic Iapetus and Rheic oceans and the terranes that were repeatedly detached from their margins.","[('J.

Besides providing an overview of the state of the art in automatic software verification, the goal of the competition is to establish standards, provide a platform for exchange to developers of such tools, educate PhD students on reproducibility approaches and benchmarking, and provide computing resources to developers that do not have access to compute clusters. The competition consisted of 23 805 verification tasks for C programs and 586 verification tasks for Java programs. The specifications include reachability, memory safety, overflows, and termination. This year, the competition introduced a new competition track on witness validation, where validators for verification witnesses are evaluated with respect to their quality.","[('Dirk Beyer', '')]","['10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_27', '10.1109/ASE.2019.00121', '10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_33', '10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_22', '10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_25', '10.1134/S0361768820080022', '10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_30', '10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_14', '10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_1', '10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_38', '10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_43', '10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_25', '10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_31', '10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_55', '10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_20', '10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_9', '10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21', '10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_24', '10.1007/978-3-030-71500-7_17', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20', '10.5281/zenodo.7627787', '10.1007/978-3-031-30826-0_17', '10.5281/zenodo.7627783', '10.5281/zenodo.7627791', '10.5281/zenodo.7627829', '10.1145/2950290.2950351', '10.1145/2786805.2786867', '10.1007/978-3-319-92994-1_1', '10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_26', '10.1007/978-3-030-99524-9_31', '10.1007/978-3-030-99429-7_3', '10.5281/zenodo.7635975', '10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16', '10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y', '10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_10', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_26', '10.1007/978-3-031-22308-2_8', '10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_8', '10.1007/978-3-662-48288-9_9', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_22', '10.1145/2049697.2049700', '10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_32', '10.1007/978-3-319-94111-0_7', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_32', '10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_20', '10.1007/978-3-540-24730-2_15', '10.1145/1985793.1985839', '10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_10', '10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_17', '10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_42', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_23', '10.1007/978-3-642-33826-7_16', '10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_34', '10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_32', '10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_41', '10.1007/978-3-319-48869-1_5', '10.1007/s10009-021-00619-x', '10.1007/978-3-642-27940-9_13', '10.48550/arXiv.2010.05812', '10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_36', '10.1145/3519939.3523727', '10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_15', '10.1007/s10009-015-0407-9', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_19', '10.48550/arXiv.2303.06477', '10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_6', '10.1007/978-3-319-66706-5_7', '10.1007/s10817-019-09535-x', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_25', '10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2', '10.1007/978-3-319-49052-6', '10.1007/s10009-021-00617-z', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_29', '10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_35', '10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_29', '10.1145/3478536', '10.1145/3332466.3374529', '10.1007/978-3-030-41600-3_1', '10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_19', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_30', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_35', '10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_26', '10.1007/978-3-030-02508-3_17', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_28', '10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_26', '10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_31', '10.23919/DATE54114.2022.9774672', '10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_42', '10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_37', '10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_30', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_27', '10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_21', '10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_44', '10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_30', '10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_26', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_24', '10.1145/1889997.1890000', '10.1007/s10515-013-0122-2', '10.1007/s10515-020-00270-x', '10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_19', '10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_34', '10.5281/zenodo.6147218', '10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_29', '10.1145/3368089.3409734', '10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_38', '10.23919/FMCAD.2017.8102257', '10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_23', '10.1145/2970276.2970337', '10.15514/ISPRAS-2017-29(4)-13', '10.5281/zenodo.7612021', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_36', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_34', '10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_3']",Springer Nature Switzerland

Voting data from a thousand districts and a hundred cities for four elections between 1930 and 1933 show that areas more affected by austerity (spending cuts and tax increases) had relatively higher vote shares for the Nazi Party. We also find that the localities with relatively high austerity experienced relatively high suffering (measured by mortality rates) and these areas’ electorates were more likely to vote for the Nazi Party. Our findings are robust to a range of specifications including an instrumental variable strategy and a border-pair policy discontinuity design.,"[('Gregori Galofré-Vilà', ''), ('Christopher M.

These include remains of organisms within the size range of pollen grains ( c. 10–250 µm), resistant to laboratory treatments used for the preparation of palynological samples. NPPs are a large and taxonomically heterogeneous group of remains of organisms living in diverse environments. Taxonomically, they belong to a wide variety of groups such as cyanobacteria, algae, vascular plants, invertebrates and fungi. The aim of this chapter is to provide a general overview of NPP groups observed in palynology slides. It includes more than 40 of the most common groups starting with acritarcha, cyanobacteria and algae, moving through transitional groups to animals and fungi and finishing with human-made objects such as textile fibres. Although far from complete, it provides an updated overview of taxonomical diversity of NPPs and their indicator values. Further works on NPP identifications are of great importance to improve our current knowledge. Since NPPs occur in all kinds of sediments, their analysis is a powerful tool for reconstructing environmental changes over time. Further detailed studies of specific NPP groups and their indicator values will open the way for new fields of study.","[('Lyudmila Shumilovskikh', 'Department of Palynology and Climate Dynamics, Georg-August-University Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany'), ('Lyudmila Shumilovskikh', 'Research Laboratory ‘Herbarium’, National Research Tomsk State University, Tomsk, Russia'), (""Jennifer M.

Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) can provide global, precise, and continuous positioning in open-sky environments. However, urban environments with frequent outliers and cycle slips degrade the traditional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) positioning performance. The susceptibility of EKF to outliers is attributed to its inherent structure. To mitigate, the GNSS positioning based on the Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) structure is adopted. FGO can enhance time correlation among observations and enable the updating of historical information, thereby improving resistance against outliers. In this study, we proposed a single-differenced GNSS-FGO model instead of the double-differenced model to preserve the sparsity of FGO, and outlier detection and PAR methods are employed to ensure urban positioning performance. To evaluate the proposed structure, experiments are conducted in both urban and open-sky environments. The results demonstrate the improvement of positioning accuracy and reliability, compared to EKF.","[('Y. Zhang', ''), ('F. Zhu', ''), ('X. Zhang', '')]",[],Copernicus GmbH
10.1111/ehr.13105,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,"Beyond the male breadwinner: Life-cycle living standards of intact and disrupted English working families, 1260-1850",[],"AbstractThis article provides a novel framework within which to evaluate real household incomes of predominantly rural working families of various sizes and structures in England in the years 1260–1850. We reject ahistorical assumptions about complete reliance on men's wages and male breadwinning, moving closer to reality by including women and children's contributions to family incomes. Our empirical strategy benefits from recent estimates of men's annual earnings, so avoiding the need to gross up day rates using problematic assumptions about days worked, and from new data on women and children's wages and labour inputs. A family life‐cycle approach which accommodates consumption smoothing through saving adds further breadth and realism. Moreover, the analysis embraces two historically common but often overlooked family types alternative to the traditional male‐breadwinner model: one where the husband is missing having died or deserted, and one where the husband is present but unwilling or unable to find work. Our framework suggests living standards varied widely by family structure and dependency ratio. Incorporating detailed demographic data available for 1560 onward suggests that small and intact families enjoyed high and rising living standards after 1700, while large or disrupted families depended on child labour and poor relief untilc. 1830. A broader perspective on family structures informs understanding of the chronology and nature of poverty and coping strategies.","[('Sara Horrell', 'London School of Economics'), ('Jane Humphries', 'All Souls College, Oxford and London School of Economics'), ('Jacob Weisdorf', 'Sapienza University of Rome, CAGE, CEPR')]","['10.1017/CBO9780511816680', '10.1111/ehr.12079', '10.1111/ehr.12661', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00566.x', '10.1080/03071028708567670', '10.1017/CBO9780511495670', '10.1111/1468-0289.00089', '10.1093/ereh/het009', '10.1017/S0268416019000328', '10.1093/hwj/35.1.22', '10.2307/2598224', '10.1017/S136149161100013X', '10.1111/ehr.12997', '10.1017/CBO9780511528590', '10.1017/S0022050700022282', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2004.00292.x', '10.1017/CBO9781139031110', '10.1007/s13524-017-0556-4', '10.1177/036319908200700401', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2006.00358.x', '10.1017/S0022050700021197', '10.1017/CBO9781139167697', '10.1093/pastj/gts016', '10.1017/S0022050700021100', '10.1007/s001480050048', '10.1080/03585522.2013.861768', '10.1111/j.2397-2335.1942.tb04540.x', '10.1017/S0022050700011931', '10.2307/2597872', '10.1006/exeh.1995.1021', '10.1017/S0020859000114786', '10.1016/j.eeh.2019.04.001', '10.1093/pastj/gtaa005', '10.3828/lhr.63.1.31', '10.1017/CBO9780511780455', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2012.00651.x', '10.1017/S0268416020000247', '10.1111/ehr.12693', '10.1017/S0022050715000662', '10.1093/ej/uez017', '10.1017/9781108560535', '10.1007/978-1-349-25260-2_8', '10.1111/1468-0289.00159', '10.1017/CBO9780511896002', '10.1017/CBO9780511560675', '10.1515/9781787441378-007', '10.1017/CBO9780511561207.003', '10.1017/S1361491698000069', '10.1093/ereh/het005', '10.1515/9781782049944', '10.1017/CBO9780511933905', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00588.x', '10.1007/s11698-016-0140-y', '10.1016/j.eeh.2012.08.001', '10.1017/CHO9781139815017.003', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199600793.001.0001', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00533.x', '10.1017/CBO9780511599446', '10.1179/004049602793710107', '10.1017/CBO9780511818196', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2005.00311.x', '10.1017/CBO9780511660344', '10.1093/oso/9780190847883.001.0001']",Wiley
10.1017/S0963926820000206,URBAN HISTORY,0603 World History,Mapping spatial cultures: contributions of space syntax to research in the urban history of the nineteenth-century city,[],"AbstractThe theory and methods of space syntax can help to rebalance the prevailing cultural perspective, which views maps as ideological representations, with an analytical approach that emphasizes maps as sources for understanding space and spatial relationships embedded in built forms. The quantitative descriptions of urban street networks produced by space syntax analyses can be used to formulate and test hypotheses about patterns of urban movement, encounter and socio-economic activity in the past that can help in the interpretation of other historical source materials to give an overall account of urban spatial culture. In this article, the authors explain how space syntax, a theory and method originally developed in the field of architectural research, is making a distinctive contribution to research in social and urban history. The key principles of the method are explained by clarifying the relationship of space syntax to HGIS (Historical Geographical Information Systems) and through a worked example of research undertaken into political meeting places. A survey of research into the urban history of the nineteenth-century city using space syntax is used to highlight a number of important methodological themes and also demonstrates the range of innovative contributions that this interdisciplinary approach is able to advance. A final, theoretical, section reflects on maps and the practice of ‘mapping’ from a space syntax perspective.","[('Sam Griffiths', ''), ('Laura Vaughan', '')]","['10.4324/9781315610269', '10.1017/CBO9780511597237', '10.7202/1051383ar', '10.1111/j.1475-4762.2005.00651.x', '10.51347/jum.v14i2.3955', '10.1111/hith.10676', '10.1068/b030147', '10.1080/13555502.2017.1301179', '10.1017/CBO9780511493645', '10.1007/978-3-319-00993-3', '10.1080/1600910X.2016.1183219', '10.2307/621837', '10.1215/01642472-3315826', '10.2747/0272-3638.31.1.29', '10.1080/00420980500535146', '10.1017/CBO9780511814563', '10.2307/j.ctvqhspn', '10.2307/j.ctt1g69z0m.16', '10.4324/9781315167046-7', '10.1007/978-94-007-5009-8_11', '10.51347/jum.v14i1.4200', '10.7765/9781784996895', '10.2307/j.ctv550dcj']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

We propose that this body greatly conditioned the structural domains of the Cantabrian–Pyrenean fold-and-thrust belt during their evolution from hyperextension in Early Cretaceous times to shortening and inversion during the Cenozoic. This may be seen as a new line for cross-section construction and balancing, because previous cross-sections do not incorporate comparable volumes of exhumed mantle. Five structural cross-sections, constrained by the results of 3D gravity inversion, feed our discussion of the complexities of the doubly vergent Pyrenean orogen in view of the inversion of a precursor hyperextended rifted margin. In all sections, crustal rocks underthrust the lithospheric mantle in the hyperextended region, supporting that the near-surface exhumed mantle lithosphere acts as a more rigid buttress, allowing weaker continental material to be expelled outwards and upwards by thrusting during the Alpine collision; thus giving rise to two uplifted crustal triangular zones at the boundaries with the exhumed mantle. Contractional slip is localized in lithospheric-scale thrusts, which in turn reactivate parts of the extensional system. The NE–SW transfer zones that offset the rift therefore behave as compartmental faults during the orogenic phase. The amount of shortening increases from 34 km in the Cantabrian Cordillera, where the Basque–Cantabrian Basin partially preserves its original extensional geometry, to 135 km in the nappe stack of the central Pyrenees.","[('Jesús García-Senz', 'Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain'), ('Antonio Pedrera', 'Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain'), ('Conxi Ayala', 'Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain'), ('Conxi Ayala', 'Present address: Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera (IJCJA-CSIC), Carrer Lluís Solé i Sabaris s/n, 08028 Barcelona, Spain'), ('Ana Ruiz-Constán', 'Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain'), ('Alejandro Robador', 'Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain'), ('Luis Roberto Rodríguez-Fernández', 'Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain')]","['10.1017/CBO9780511524851.031', '10.1002/2017TC004670', '10.1080/17445647.2015.1126538', '10.2113/gssgfbull.S7-XVIII.6.1725', '10.1002/2015TC004019', '10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024<0675:MMFSCT>2.3.CO;2', '10.1029/1999JB900390', '10.2113/gssgfbull.VI.2.251', '10.1016/0040-1951(86)90254-4', '10.1016/0012-821X(80)90166-1', '10.1306/M46497C23', '10.1016/j.epsl.2004.02.013', '10.1111/bre.12187', '10.1016/B978-0-12-809417-4.00019-7', '10.3989/egeol.85415-6720', '10.1016/j.epsl.2012.04.018', '10.1016/j.tecto.2015.07.009', '10.1007/s00531-015-1177-z', '10.1016/S0012-821X(97)00087-3', '10.1016/0012-821X(96)00123-9', '10.1130/GES01363.1', '10.1038/s41598-018-27889-x', '10.1146/annurev.ea.20.050192.001043', '10.1029/TC008i001p00023', '10.1016/0012-821X(73)90041-1', '10.1144/GSL.SP.2003.208.01.11', '10.1002/2013TC003471', '10.1130/0016-7606(1993)105<0715:LBACOS>2.3.CO;2', '10.1029/TC008i005p01051', '10.1007/978-3-642-78849-9_15', '10.2113/gssgfbull.VI.2.273', '10.2113/gssgfbull.VI.2.287', '10.1002/2014TC003816', '10.1038/331508a0', '10.1130/0091-7613(2001)029<1023:SOSSPI>2.0.CO;2', '10.1029/1999JB900321', '10.1016/j.tecto.2010.06.020', '10.1016/B978-044452748-6/00097-3', '10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2015.10.020', '10.1029/2008TC002406', '10.1029/2010GC003218', '10.1306/12090909116', '10.1111/ter.12087', '10.1029/2009TC002588', '10.1144/jgs2016-002', '10.1130/0016-7606(1999)111<1808:COTGOF>2.3.CO;2', '10.1016/j.tecto.2015.06.017', '10.1007/s00531-002-0283-x', '10.1007/s00531-014-1023-8', '10.1130/G20565.1', '10.1111/ter.12104', '10.2973/dsdp.proc.48.154.1979', '10.1007/978-94-011-3066-0_21', '10.1016/0191-8141(86)90058-1', '10.1111/ter.12240', '10.1029/2001JB000549', '10.1029/2001JB001667', '10.1029/2007JB005021', '10.1016/j.lithos.2015.04.018', '10.1002/2017TC004716', '10.1029/2018TC005222', '10.1111/j.1365-246X.1995.tb06436.x', '10.1080/17445647.2015.1084545', '10.1007/978-94-011-3066-0_22', '10.1016/S0040-1951(96)00114-X', '10.1016/j.tecto.2015.08.046', '10.1038/nature09520', '10.1029/2010TC002735', '10.1016/j.crte.2015.12.005', '10.1029/TC008i001p00041', '10.1016/j.tecto.2017.07.008', '10.1029/2003JB002514', '10.1029/2005JB003856', '10.1144/0016-76492010-072', '10.1029/JZ064i001p00049', '10.1002/tect.20019', '10.1144/gsjgs.153.2.0301', '10.1029/98TC00561', '10.1016/j.crte.2015.10.010', '10.1016/j.tecto.2018.01.009', '10.1016/0031-9201(90)90082-9', '10.1002/2014TC003529', '10.1046/j.0956-540x.2001.01393.x', '10.1016/0264-8172(95)98854-X', '10.1306/M46497C9', '10.4095/208180', '10.1130/G37812.1', '10.1016/0012-821X(75)90151-X', '10.1190/1.1442298', '10.1016/B978-0-12-809417-4.00017-3']",Geological Society of London

Non-planarity of faults can be caused by variations in failure modes, which in turn are dictated by mechanical stratigraphy interacting with the ambient stress field, as well as by linkage of fault segments. Different portions of a fault or fault zone may experience volume gain, volume conservation and volume loss simultaneously depending on the position along a fault's surface, the stresses resolved on the fault and the associated deformation mechanisms. This variation in deformation style and associated volume change has a profound effect on the ability of a fault to transmit (or impede) fluid both along and across the fault. In this paper we explore interrelated concepts of failure mode and resolved stress analysis, and provide examples of fault geometry in normal faulting and reverse faulting stress regimes that illustrate the effects of fault geometry on failure behaviour and related importance to fluid transmission.

Meanwhile, although Constrained Horn Clauses ($$\mathrm {CHCs}$$ CHCs ) empower a wide range of verification techniques and tools, they lack the ability to express hyperproperties beyond k-safety such as generalized non-interference and co-termination.This paper describes a novel and fully automated constraint-based approach to relational verification. We first introduce a new class of predicate Constraint Satisfaction Problems called $$\mathrm {pfwCSP}$$ pfwCSP where constraints are represented as clauses modulo first-order theories over predicate variables of three kinds: ordinary, well-founded, or functional. This generalization over $$\mathrm {CHCs}$$ CHCs permits arbitrary (i.e., possibly non-Horn) clauses, well-foundedness constraints, functionality constraints, and is capable of expressing these relational verification problems. Our approach enables us to express and automatically verify problem instances that require non-trivial (i.e., non-sequential and non-lock-step) self-composition by automatically inferring appropriate schedulers (or alignment) that dictate when and which program copies move. To solve problems in this new language, we present a constraint solving method for $$\mathrm {pfwCSP}$$ pfwCSP based on stratified CounterExample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) of ordinary, well-founded, and functional predicates.We have implemented the proposed framework and obtained promising results on diverse relational verification problems that are beyond the scope of the previous verification frameworks.","[('Hiroshi Unno', ''), ('Tachio Terauchi', ''), ('Eric Koskinen', '')]","['10.1017/S0956796819000145', '10.1007/978-3-642-15769-1_8', '10.1145/3062341.3062378', '10.1145/2678015.2682546', '10.1145/3009837.3009889', '10.1007/978-3-642-21437-0_17', '10.1145/964001.964003', '10.1109/CSF.2007.30', '10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_61', '10.1007/978-3-319-23534-9_2', '10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_20', '10.1145/3314221.3314596', '10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_15', '10.1109/CSF.2008.7', '10.1145/3371070', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_7', '10.1007/978-3-540-32004-3_20', '10.1145/3324783', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_11', '10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_7', '10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_3', '10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_5', '10.1145/2837614.2837664', '10.1145/2737924.2737976', '10.1145/2254064.2254112', '10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_20', '10.1007/978-3-642-38574-2_20', '10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8603013', '10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_38', '10.1007/11691372_33', '10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_19', '10.1145/1993498.1993525', '10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_2', '10.2168/LMCS-11(1:16)2015', '10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24', '10.1007/11863908_18', '10.1007/978-3-030-61470-6_7', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_17', '10.1145/2908080.2908099', '10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_9', '10.1007/978-3-642-37036-6_31', '10.1007/978-3-642-38856-9_21', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_9', '10.1145/1168857.1168907', '10.1145/2908080.2908092', '10.1145/1706299.1706315', '10.1007/11547662_24', '10.1007/978-3-662-46669-8_25', '10.1145/1599410.1599445', '10.1145/1134744.1134750', '10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_30', '10.1007/978-3-642-38856-9_5', '10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_22', '10.1007/978-3-540-68237-0_5', '10.1145/3192366.3192416', '10.1145/2784731.2784766']",Springer International Publishing

Many recent and past studies confirm that there is an apparent gap in the literature to understand this phenomenon among students of higher learning institutions.Design/methodology/approachThe study is based on a sample of 393 students studying in 35 different universities and institutions in the North, South and Western regions of India. The data were analyzed using hierarchical regression and ANOVA.FindingsThe empirical result shows a relationship and a positive impact of individual entrepreneurial orientation dimensions upon entrepreneurial intentions. Controlling for gender, males depict higher perseverance toward individual entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial intentions. The same result was found for management and entrepreneurship students who also depict a higher (mean)t-value than science, engineering students. The findings of this study reveal a significant contribution to the academic literature by highlighting the influencing role of gender, academic background, and region upon entrepreneurial intentions.Practical implicationsThe study reveals that institutional culture, lack of academic rigor, regional difference, economic gaps, gender perception, and overall culture may be considered as bothering forces for entrepreneurship to grow via institutions. These forces, if eliminated, can help build an institutional environment helpful for entrepreneurial progression in the country.Originality/valueThere are limited studies available in the context of individual entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial Intention relationship. This study provides the analysis for Indian regions and uses data collected from different universities and institutions of India.","[('Sumit Kumar', ''), ('Zahoor Ahmad Paray', ''), ('Amit Kumar Dwivedi', '')]","['10.1037/mgr0000035', '10.1108/17506200810897231', '10.1007/s10843-015-0144-x', '10.1108/00400911011050945', '10.1007/s11365-013-0278-z', '10.1108/JMP-07-2014-0213', '10.1186/s40497-016-0057-8', '10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.03.181', '10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00033-0', '10.1108/17561391011019023', '10.1108/00400911211210314', '10.1080/08985620903233929', '10.5465/amr.1996.9602161568', '10.1108/IJIS-07-2017-0067', '10.1108/IJIS-07-2017-0067', '10.1108/JEC-12-2016-0046', '10.1016/j.techfore.2017.07.005', '10.1111/j.1540-627X.2008.00257.x', '10.1108/ET-06-2015-0044', '10.1108/00400911211274864', '10.1108/03090590910939049', '10.1108/14626000810917843', '10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.09.093', '10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.01.001', '10.1108/ET-02-2016-0024', '10.1002/smj.4250100107', '10.1016/0883-9026(90)90004-D', '10.1111/j.1540-6520.2006.00110.x', '10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.11.024', '10.1108/IJGE-08-2016-0028', '10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00396.x', '10.1007/s11365-015-0356-5', '10.1287/mnsc.29.7.770', '10.2307/41164491', '10.1111/j.1540-6520.2008.00238.x', '10.1111/j.1540-6520.2007.00223.x', '10.1177/0971355713490621', '10.1002/smj.360']",Emerald

A lifelong learning mindset is a way of approaching one's work with curiosity, strategic thinking, and resilience. Career success refers to objective (e.g., number of promotions) and subjective (e.g., job satisfaction) indicators of progress and fulfillment in one's work.Design/methodology/approachTwo studies are presented. Both studies draw from an accounting and finance program at a Canadian university. In study 1, data were collected from students (n = 62) and their supervisors at the end of a four-month co-operative education (co-op) work term. In study 2, data were collected from graduates (n = 148).FindingsResults suggest that developing a lifelong learning mindset enhances both objective and subjective career success. Participants' lifelong learning mindset was associated with objective career success in both studies (supervisor-rated performance in study 1 and number of promotions in study 2). Lifelong learning mindset was associated with subjective career success in study 2 (job satisfaction, work engagement, and job-related self-efficacy) but not in study 1 (experience satisfaction).Originality/valueThis article presents the first empirical examination of the relationship between a lifelong learning mindset and career success. Insights from the article highlight the fact that educators and workplace managers might work together to promote a lifelong learning mindset for current and future workers.","[('David W.

10.1093/pastj/gtaa022,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,HEATHROW AND THE MAKING OF NEOLIBERAL BRITAIN,[],"Abstract How might we understand neoliberalism and its history differently if we trace its emergence and operation in a particular place? As the first airport in the world to be privatized in 1986 Heathrow is a paradigmatic neoliberal space. And yet for decades before it was sold the airport’s services — catering, cleaning, retail and security — had been steadily deregulated and outsourced in ways that force us to reconsider neoliberalism as discrete from, or emerging from a rupture with, welfare capitalism. The precarious and cheap outsourced forms of labour at Heathrow were performed by Commonwealth citizens of colour, often women, who had paradoxically arrived in Britain through an increasingly hostile immigration regime at the airport. The racialized forms of neoliberal capitalism at the airport depended upon and reproduced a post-imperial social formation that was no less marked by postcolonial crises and a new biopolitics of immigration control designed to restrict their diasporas in the metropole. Seen from Heathrow, neoliberalism is less about the global flow of ideas and capital than the local social formations and labour regimes engendered by changing forms of accumulation.","[('James Vernon', 'University of California, Berkeley')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Therefore, understanding landslide magnitude and distribution is central to marine and coastal hazard planning. We present the first submarine landslide database for the eastern margin of New Zealand comprising &gt;2200 landslides occurring in water depths from c. 300–4000 m. Landslides are more prevalent and, on average, larger on the active margin compared with the passive margin. We attribute higher concentrations of landslides on the active margin to tectonic processes including uplift and oversteepening, faulting and seamount subduction. Submarine landslide scars are concentrated around canyon systems and close to canyon thalwegs. This suggests that not only does mass wasting play a major role in canyon evolution, but also that canyon-forming processes may provide preconditioning factors for slope failure. Results of this study offer unique insights into the spatial distribution, magnitude and morphology of submarine landslides across different geological settings, providing a better understanding of the causative factors for mass wasting in New Zealand and around the world.","[('S.

Also, it was found that entrepreneurial culture has a positive effect on university environment, and the latter has a positive effect on entrepreneurial training.Research limitations/implicationsThe main limitation of this study was that only ten Colombian universities were sampled; therefore, general inferences cannot be made. Additionally, the variables investigated here may have not accurately measured the full scale of the entrepreneurship programmes in such universities or the way the culture of these institutions had a direct impact on students. Projects such as the Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students' Survey (GUESSS), which measure variables related to entrepreneurship at the university level, enable universities to shape their policies around this important topic.

This study compares four machine-learning algorithms comprising of Classification And Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification of urban land-use and land-cover (LULC) features. Using multitemporal and multisensor Landsat data from 1984-2020 at 5-year intervals for the Greater Gaborone Planning Area (GGPA) in Botswana, the aim of the study is to determine the performance of the classifiers in the extraction of different urban LULC features as built-up, bare-soil, water, grass, shrubs and forest. The results show that for mapping built-up areas, RF and SVM presented the best results with overall accuracy of 85%. Bare soil is best mapped using RF and CART with accuracy of up to 98%, while SVM and GTB were most suitable for mapping water bodies. The suitable classifiers for mapping the vegetation classes were RF for grass (94.5%), SVM for shrubland (81.5%) and GTB for forest (84.3%). In terms of class specific accuracy, RF achieved the highest performance with average overall accuracy (OA) of 95.9%, SVM (95.8%), GTB (95.6%) and CART (95.1%). The same performance pattern was observed from the F1-score, True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR) and Area under ROC curve (AUC) metrices for the class classification accuracies. The overall accuracy for the eight-epoch years were RF (87.8%), SVM (87.5%), GTB (86.4%) and CART (85.3%). To improve on the urban LULC mapping, the study proposes the post-classification feature fusion of the best classifier results.","[('Y. Ouma', ''), ('B. Nkwae', ''), ('D. Moalafhi', ''), ('P.

In order to bring about the conditions for the female autonomy that characterized the European marriage pattern (in which women had a say in the decision about when and whom they marry), women needed to earn a decent wage. This is clearly affected by the gender wage ratio and the possibility of women earning their own living and having the option of remaining single. So far no attempt has been made to compare the wages of women across Europe over the long run. In this article we provide evidence on the wages of unskilled women for seven European countries (represented by cities or regions within these countries) between 1300 and 1800. Our evidence shows that there were two worlds of female labour. In the south of Europe women earned about 50 per cent of the wage of unskilled male labourers, a ratio that seems to have been fixed by custom. In the northern and western parts of Europe this ratio was much higher during late medieval period, but it showed a declining trend between about 1500 and 1800, a change that was caused by market forces.","[('Alexandra de Pleijt', 'Utrecht University'), ('Jan Luiten van Zanden', 'Utrecht University')]","['10.1006/exeh.2001.0775', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2003.00257.x', '10.1017/CBO9780511816680', '10.1111/ehr.12079', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00566.x', '10.35948/0557-1359/1977.873', '10.1093/past/165.1.3', '10.1093/past/173.1.199', '10.2307/3180153', '10.1093/oso/9780195073904.001.0001', '10.1093/pastj/gtq032', '10.1093/hwj/35.1.22', '10.1080/00140138708969760', '10.1111/1468-0289.12032', '10.1080/20780389.2017.1372186', '10.1111/1468-0289.00054', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2004.00292.x', '10.1017/CBO9780511495779', '10.2478/v10237-012-0015-5', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2006.00358.x', '10.1484/M.HAMA-EB.5.103309', '10.1257/aer.103.3.545', '10.1017/S0022050720000145', '10.1017/S0268416008006772', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00648.x', '10.1257/jep.29.4.227', '10.2307/j.ctvcm4h7m', '10.1257/aer.90.4.806', '10.1179/007817286790616552', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198201540.001.0001', '10.1093/past/173.1.191', '10.2307/2597872', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2012.00663.x', '10.1111/ehr.12693', '10.1017/S0022050715000662', '10.1017/CBO9780511896002', '10.1515/9781846159886-007', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00483.x', '10.3917/rfas.en605.0073', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00500.x', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198205548.001.0001', '10.1524/jbwg.2004.45.2.25', '10.1017/CBO9780511628672.011', '10.1093/ereh/hew013', '10.1111/1468-0424.00210', '10.1093/hwj/7.1.3', '10.1111/ehr.12733', '10.1080/13545701.2012.734630', '10.1017/CBO9780511599446', '10.1257/aer.103.6.2227', '10.1017/S0022050718000396', '10.1163/ej.9789004175174.i-346', '10.1016/j.hisfam.2011.08.003', '10.1016/j.eeh.2011.11.002']",Wiley

A quasi-experiment from early twentieth-century Italy,[],"AbstractThis article shows that a shift towards a more centralized school system can benefit countries that are characterized by poor levels of human capital and large regional disparities in education. In 1911, Italy moved from a fully decentralized primary school system towards centralization through the Daneo‐Credaro Reform. The design of the Reform allows us to compare treated municipalities with those that retained school autonomy. Our quasi‐experiment, based on propensity score matching (PSM), shows that centralization substantially increased the pace of human capital accumulation. Treated municipalities were characterized by a 0.43 percentage‐point premium on the average annual growth of literacy between 1911 and 1921. We discuss some of the channels through which the new legislation affected primary schooling and literacy, with important implications for long‐term economic growth.","[('Gabriele Cappelli', 'University of Siena and University of Barcelona'), ('Michelangelo Vasta', 'University of Siena')]","['10.1257/aer.102.5.1832', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199944590.003.0006', '10.1111/ehr.12738', '10.1016/j.eeh.2017.12.003', '10.1111/ehr.12332', '10.1177/0895904891005004003', '10.1093/ereh/hev020', '10.1007/s11698-015-0133-2', '10.1111/ehr.12078', '10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.03.001', '10.1016/j.eeh.2017.08.002', '10.1007/s10887-017-9141-3', '10.1016/j.eeh.2018.07.003', '10.3386/w9259', '10.4337/9781849806565.00016', '10.1017/S0022050718000712', '10.1093/ereh/heu018', '10.7208/chicago/9780226078854.003.0006', '10.1007/978-3-642-40406-1_23', '10.1016/j.jdeveco.2012.08.002', '10.1007/s10887-012-9081-x', '10.1111/j.1467-6419.2010.00633.x', '10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.04.007', '10.18235/0008567', '10.1017/CBO9780511510724', '10.1016/0304-3932(88)90168-7', '10.2307/2596346', '10.1086/600102', '10.1093/ereh/hex006', '10.1086/261725', '10.1093/biomet/70.1.41', '10.1111/ehr.12101', '10.2307/1884513', '10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.04.006', '10.18356/7007ef44-en']",Wiley

The approach is underpinned by an inductive framework: this is structured as a sequential loop between a learner, which manipulates a candidate BC structured as a neural network, and a sound verifier, which either certifies the candidate’s validity or generates counter-examples to further guide the learner. We compare the approach against state-of-the-art techniques, over polynomial and non-polynomial dynamical models: the outcomes show that we can synthesise sound BCs up to two orders of magnitude faster, with in particular a stark speedup on the verification engine (up to three orders less), whilst needing a far smaller data set (up to three orders less) for the learning part. Beyond improvements over the state of the art, we further challenge the new approach on a hybrid dynamical model and on larger-dimensional models, and showcase the numerical robustness of our algorithms and codebase.","[('Andrea Peruffo', ''), ('Daniele Ahmed', ''), ('Alessandro Abate', '')]","['10.1109/LCSYS.2020.3005328', '10.1109/LCSYS.2020.3005328', '10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_15', '10.1016/j.automatica.2009.02.028', '10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_6', '10.1109/ICRA.2012.6225351', '10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.11.154', '10.1007/s10817-020-09562-z', '10.1016/j.jsc.2016.07.010', '10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24', '10.1007/978-3-642-31365-3_23', '10.1007/978-3-642-38574-2_14', '10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_17', '10.1007/978-3-662-50497-0', '10.1016/j.nahs.2020.100858', '10.1007/978-3-319-19249-9_23', '10.1007/978-3-540-70545-1_17', '10.1016/j.automatica.2005.08.007', '10.1007/978-3-540-24743-2_32', '10.1109/TAC.2007.902736', '10.1109/CDC.2015.7402879', '10.1145/2968478.2968485', '10.15607/RSS.2017.XIII.049', '10.3182/20130904-3-FR-2041.00198', '10.1007/978-3-319-95582-7_25', '10.1145/1168857.1168907', '10.1109/TRO.2017.2659727', '10.1145/2968478.2968484', '10.1145/3365365.3382222']",Springer International Publishing

The need for a reproducible method of thermal maturity assessment by means of Raman spectroscopic analyses on the organic matter is essential for the development of this technique as a robust support in organic petrographical analyses. The new method was tested on concentrated kerogen derived from a set of 33 samples that originated from cuttings from a 5000 m-thick section drilled in offshore Angola. The proposed method can be applied separately in the D and G bands regions of the Raman spectra, and uses a fitting approach based on asymmetrical Gaussian deconvolution and on the measurement of the integrated area. Results from this work demonstrate that Raman parameters carried out by the new methods reflect the increase in aromaticity in kerogen in diagenesis. Finally, two parametric equations have been proposed to correlate Raman parameters and thermal maturity: the first is for the thermal maturity interval between 0.3 and 1.5% R o ; and the second has a higher precision of between 1.0 and 1.5% R o . The two equations are the result of a multi-linear regression based on robust correlations between Raman parameters and vitrinite reflectance (R o %).","[('Andrea Schito', ''), ('Sveva Corrado', '')]","['10.1046/j.1525-1314.2002.00408.x', '10.1016/S1386-1425(03)00070-2', '10.1016/j.vibspec.2016.08.014', '10.1098/rsta.2004.1448', '10.1016/j.chemphys.2004.02.018', '10.1016/j.carbon.2016.07.039', '10.1103/PhysRevB.61.14095', '10.1016/0016-2361(72)90079-8', '10.1016/j.coal.2010.06.002', '10.1016/j.coal.2018.03.005', '10.1016/j.coal.2014.10.013', '10.1016/j.saa.2008.09.006', '10.1111/j.1365-3121.2010.00956.x', '10.1016/j.fuel.2007.01.008', '10.1016/j.coal.2015.11.010', '10.3389/fenrg.2017.00024', '10.1016/j.coal.2008.06.002', '10.1016/j.coal.2016.05.002', '10.1021/jp0128473', '10.1063/1.1710853', '10.1103/PhysRevB.20.392', '10.1039/B613962K', '10.1002/jrs.2636', '10.1016/S0022-3093(98)00349-4', '10.1016/j.saa.2005.02.015', '10.1039/C5CP06519D', '10.1098/rsta.2004.1454', '10.1016/0146-6380(93)90042-A', '10.1016/j.carbon.2005.02.018', '10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00221-5', '10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2016.04.002', '10.1016/j.orggeochem.2016.12.006', '10.1016/j.coal.2017.02.003', '10.1295/polymj.4.460', '10.1016/0146-6380(86)90055-0', '10.1063/1.1674108', '10.1016/j.coal.2014.03.006', '10.1046/j.1525-1314.1996.05792.x', '10.1016/j.coal.2013.10.013']",Geological Society of London

Its prevalence has had a powerful impact in healthcare, with numerous applications and intelligent systems achieving clinical level expertise. However, building robust and generalizable systems relies on training algorithms in a centralized fashion using large, heterogeneous datasets. In medicine, these datasets are time consuming to annotate and difficult to collect centrally due to privacy concerns. Recently, Federated Learning has been proposed as a distributed learning technique to alleviate many of these privacy concerns by providing a decentralized training paradigm for models using large, distributed data. This new approach has become the defacto way of building machine learning models in multiple industries (e.g. edge computing, smartphones). Due to its strong potential, Federated Learning is also becoming a popular training method in healthcare, where patient privacy is of paramount concern. In this paper we performed an extensive literature review to identify state-of-the-art Federated Learning applications for cancer research and clinical oncology analysis. Our objective is to provide readers with an overview of the evolving Federated Learning landscape, with a focus on applications and algorithms in oncology space. Moreover, we hope that this review will help readers to identify potential needs and future directions for research and development.","[('Alexander Chowdhury', ''), ('Hasan Kassem', ''), ('Nicolas Padoy', ''), ('Renato Umeton', ''), ('Alexandros Karargyris', '')]","['10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848', '10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298594', '10.1109/CVPR.2016.90', '10.1007/978-3-642-24797-2', '10.1007/s12194-017-0406-5', '10.2741/4725', '10.1007/s10278-017-0009-z', '10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2', '10.1093/jamia/ocy017', '10.1038/s41597-019-0322-0', '10.1609/aaai.v33i01.3301590', '10.3390/informatics8030059', '10.1109/ICCV.2017.226', '10.1038/s41746-020-00323-1', '10.2200/S00960ED2V01Y201910AIM043', '10.1016/j.cie.2020.106854', '10.1007/978-3-030-61609-0_60', '10.1007/978-3-030-11723-8_9', '10.1038/s41598-020-69250-1', '10.1093/neuonc/noz175.737', '10.1007/s11060-017-2420-1', '10.1109/TMI.2014.2377694', '10.1109/TII.2021.3093715', '10.3390/app11052145', '10.1007/978-3-030-60548-3_18', '10.1093/jamia/ocaa341', '10.1016/j.radonc.2019.11.019', '10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363547', '10.1109/ICCV.2017.310', '10.1007/978-3-030-60548-3_19', '10.3748/wjg.v24.i43.4846', '10.2196/25869', '10.1016/j.radonc.2021.03.013', '10.1186/s13059-021-02553-2', '10.1111/j.2517-6161.1972.tb00899.x', '10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00245', '10.21203/rs.3.rs-722389/v1', '10.1007/978-3-030-60548-3_13', '10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9434078', '10.1007/978-3-030-87199-4_34', '10.1007/978-3-030-87199-4_31', '10.1007/978-3-030-87199-4_32', '10.1038/sdata.2018.161', '10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.01387', '10.1109/JBHI.2022.3185956', '10.1007/978-3-030-60548-3_15', '10.1007/978-3-030-52705-1_35', '10.1016/S0020-7373(86)80040-2', '10.14778/3494124.3494125', '10.1007/978-3-030-50420-5_31', '10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9413927', '10.1038/s41598-020-77476-2', '10.1109/CLOUD55607.2022.00076', '10.1109/IWCMC51323.2021.9498820', '10.1200/CCI.20.00045', '10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006173', '10.1007/978-3-030-63076-8_2', '10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107872', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.07.234', '10.1007/978-3-030-32692-0_16', '10.1101/2021.02.24.432489', '10.1109/TCBB.2018.2829760', '10.1145/3462203.3475875', '10.2478/popets-2021-0041', '10.21203/rs.3.rs-1478332/v1', '10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00081', '10.14722/ndss.2021.24434', '10.1007/s11433-021-1753-3']",Springer International Publishing

Advances in visual technologies--daguerreotypes, lithographs, cartes de visite, and steam printing presses--enabled people to see and participate in social reform movements in new ways. African American activists seized these opportunities and produced images that advanced campaigns for black rights. In this book, Aston Gonzalez charts the changing roles of African American visual artists as they helped build the world they envisioned. Understudied artists such as Robert Douglass Jr., Patrick Henry Reason, James Presley Ball, and Augustus Washington produced images to persuade viewers of the necessity for racial equality, black political leadership, and freedom from slavery. Moreover, these activist artists’ networks of transatlantic patronage and travels to Europe, the Caribbean, and Africa reveal their extensive involvement in the most pressing concerns for black people in the Atlantic world. Their work demonstrates how images became central to the ways that people developed ideas about race, citizenship, and politics during the nineteenth century.","[('Aston Gonzalez', '')]",[],University of North Carolina Press
10.1111/ehr.12964,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,"Urbanization and mortality in Britain, c. 1800-50",[],"AbstractIn the long‐running debate over standards of living during the industrial revolution, pessimists have identified deteriorating health conditions in towns as undermining the positive effects of rising real incomes on the ‘biological standard of living’. This article reviews long‐run historical relationships between urbanization and epidemiological trends in England, and then addresses the specific question: did mortality rise especially in rapidly growing industrial and manufacturing towns in the period c. 1830–50? Using comparative data for British, European, and American cities and selected rural populations, this study finds good evidence for widespread increases in mortality in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. However, this phenomenon was not confined to ‘new’ or industrial towns. Instead, mortality rose in the 1830s especially among young children (aged one to four years) in a wide range of populations and environments. This pattern of heightened mortality extended between c. 1830 and c. 1870, and coincided with a well‐established rise and decline in scarlet fever virulence and mortality. The evidence presented here therefore supports claims that mortality worsened for young children in the middle decades of the nineteenth century, but also indicates that this phenomenon was more geographically ubiquitous, less severe, and less chronologically concentrated than previously argued.","[('Romola J.

Under the constitutive logic, nationalism may adopt certain features of the neoliberal order itself, which yields a ‘neoliberal nationalism’.

I review contemporary scholarly understandings of immobility and disentangle the unavoidable relational dynamics with its positive linguistic opposite, mobility. Concrete illustrations from migration studies and the global coronavirus crisis illustrate how immobility, at various scales of analysis and experience, is not only theoretically but also socially, economically, and politically relevant. Together with the in-depth review of existing scholarship, these examples confirm that the conceptual distinction made between immobility and mobility is often purely heuristic. In the messiness of people’s lives, mobility and immobility are not mutually exclusive categories but, rather, two dynamic sides of the same coin.","[('Noel B.

One model states that I-type granites form by partial melting of older crustal lithologies (amphibolites or intermediate igneous rocks). In another view, granites are trapped rhyolitic liquids occurring at the end of fractionation trends defining a basalt–andesite–dacite–rhyolite series. This paper explores the thermal implications of both scenarios, using a heat balance model that abstracts the heat production and consumption during crustal melting. Heat is consumed by melting and by losses through the surface (conductive or advective, as a result of eruption). It is supplied as a basal conductive heat flux, as internal heat production or as advective heat carried by an influx of hot basalt into the crust. Using this abstract approach, it is possible to explore the role different parameters play in the balance of granites formed by differentiation of basalts or by crustal melting. Two end-member situations appear equally favourable to generating large volumes of granites: (1) short-lived environments dominated by high basaltic flux, where granites result mostly from basalt differentiation; and (2) long-lived systems with no or minimal basalt flux, with granites resulting chiefly from crustal melting.","[('Jean-François Moyen', '')]","['10.1029/94JB00112', '10.1016/j.tecto.2016.02.037', '10.1016/0012-821X(78)90123-1', '10.1007/s00410-008-0351-8', '10.1144/0016-76492007-166', '10.1130/MEM174', '10.1093/petrology/egl004', '10.1093/petrology/egi084', '10.1016/j.tecto.2012.06.032', '10.2113/GSELEMENTS.4.1.17', '10.1016/S0024-4937(98)00085-1', '10.1016/j.lithos.2012.01.017', '10.1016/j.gca.2005.11.008', '10.1016/j.lithos.2006.12.007', '10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00665.x', '10.1016/j.gsf.2013.06.006', '10.1007/s004100050511', '10.1098/rsta.1984.0015', '10.1093/petrology/28.6.1111', '10.1016/j.tecto.2009.03.008', '10.1144/GSL.SP.1995.095.01.05', '10.2113/gselements.7.4.235', '10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00107-1', '10.1016/j.lithos.2011.07.004', '10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030<0535:HOTSAC>2.0.CO;2', '10.1016/S0191-8141(98)00073-X', '10.1130/G37398.1', '10.1029/2009GC002540', '10.1016/j.epsl.2016.09.033', '10.1093/petrology/27.1.219', '10.1093/petrology/25.4.894', '10.1002/gj.3350250307', '10.1029/2011JB008692', '10.1111/jmg.12211', '10.2465/jmps.160128', '10.1016/j.epsl.2010.01.022', '10.1016/B978-0-444-63901-1.00007-1', '10.1007/s00410-009-0482-6', '10.1111/ter.12010', '10.2475/01.2018.03', '10.1007/s00410-009-0408-3', '10.1016/j.epsl.2010.12.017', '10.1007/978-3-662-46792-3', '10.1093/petrology/egs046', '10.1016/j.epsl.2015.06.001', '10.1016/j.gsf.2014.09.006', '10.1029/164GM03', '10.1111/j.1525-1314.2010.00906.x', '10.1093/petrology/egu074', '10.1130/0091-7613(2003)031<0529:HACGIO>2.0.CO;2', '10.1016/j.lithos.2010.09.015', '10.1016/j.lithos.2016.09.018', '10.1007/s00410-014-1015-5', '10.1093/petrology/egp022', '10.1016/j.lithos.2015.12.015', '10.1093/petrology/37.6.1491', '10.1007/978-1-4684-7335-3_11', '10.1080/08120098708729391', '10.1016/j.lithos.2009.06.006', '10.1016/B0-08-043751-6/03016-4', '10.1130/G40246.1', '10.1016/0016-7037(70)90009-8', '10.1016/j.lithos.2009.05.028', '10.1016/j.precamres.2015.10.005', '10.1038/267315a0', '10.1016/S0024-4937(00)00058-X', '10.1017/CBO9780511807442', '10.1111/j.1365-3121.2010.00952.x', '10.1016/0040-1951(89)90169-8', '10.1016/0016-7037(95)00038-2', '10.1016/j.lithos.2014.08.021', '10.1016/0191-8141(82)90021-9', '10.1029/JB094iB06p07685', '10.1038/nature07818']",Geological Society of London

Based on multi-sited archival research and memoirs, this article shows how Africans forged and used new routes to gain access to higher education denied to them in their territories of origin, and in this way also shaped scholarship policies across the globe. Focusing on British-ruled territories in East Africa, the article establishes the importance of African intermediaries and independent countries as hubs of mobility. The agency of students and intermediaries, as well as official responses, are examined in three interconnected cases: the clandestine ‘Nile route’ from East Africa to Egypt and eastern Europe; the ‘airlifts’ from East Africa to North America; and the ‘exodus’ of African students from the Eastern bloc to western Europe. Although all of these routes were short-lived, they transformed official scholarship provisions, and significantly shaped the postcolonial period in the countries of origin.","[('Eric Burton', '')]","['10.1017/CBO9780511584114', '10.1353/jwh.2019.0014', '10.1080/02582473.2017.1398776', '10.1017/S174002281900007X', '10.1017/S0021853715000304', '10.1017/CBO9781139344159', '10.1177/0022009416648253', '10.1080/03057070.2014.967487', '10.2307/27694378', '10.1007/978-1-349-02536-7', '10.2307/j.ctvh9vx9m', '10.2307/2642294', '10.1080/03057070.2017.1278982', '10.1017/S1740022816000164', '10.1080/14682745.2018.1485146', '10.1080/17531055.2015.1031859', '10.1080/03086534.2013.840438', '10.1057/9780230306486_14']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Available geochemical and isotopic systematics of these granitoids suggest variations in the source and petrogenetic mechanisms. By compiling the available geochemical data, these granitoids can be classified into four groups, namely: TTGs (tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite); sanukitoids; biotite and two-mica granites; and hybrid granites. This classification scheme is in line with the global classification of Neoarchean granites, and enables the sources and petrogenetic mechanisms of these variants to be distinguished. Available geochemical, isotopic and geochronological datasets of these granitoids are integrated and the existing tectonic models for the Neoarchean EDC are reviewed. The variability of the EDC granitoids is ascribed to crustal reworking associated with the collision of two continental blocks. The tectonomagmatic evolution of the EDC is analogous to the development of the Himalayan Orogeny. Based on the evolutionary history of the Dharwar Craton, it can be concluded that convergent margin tectonics were operational in the Indian Shield from at least c. 3.3 Ga and continued into the Phanerozoic. However, the nature and style of plate tectonics could be different with time.","[('M.

10.1017/S0738248021000407,LAW AND HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0301 Law,Creating a Common Law of Slavery for England and its New World Empire,[],"The current historical consensus is that English common law was somewhat confused, but that coerced servitude was legal in England before 1772, and certainly in its empire, where English law on slavery did not reach, because it was “beyond the line” of English justice. The common law is characterized by an effort to see continuity and consistency, and historians (despite our natural desire to track change) often look for those patterns too. Such efforts to provide a consistent overview of an England that was free and colonies that created slavery on their own—have obscured the vibrant struggle over slavery within the English judicial system—the common law—over more than a century. Not only did the common law on slavery change profoundly during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: the common law became an instrument of crown policy. It did so within a federal empire, wherein colonial legal norms had to adhere, in crucial ways, to that common law. English high court judges thus provided the legal foundation for an imperial common law of slavery that allowed people to be deemed absolute property. That definition of people as property was closely connected to absolutism, both in theory and practice. In theory the absolute power of kings over subjects was connected to that of masters over slaves. In practice, the crown's use of the courts to create laws without parliamentary consent (to bypass parliament) also increased crown revenue and thus their independence from parliamentary control. These powerful legal mechanisms made it possible to “recover” enslaved people as assets for debts, a legal definition that was essential for a market in people to function sucessfully. This history reveals the absolutist character of early capitalism, and the extent to which the character of capitalist development depends on the legal rules that define markets and justice.","[('Holly Brewer', '')]","['10.1017/S073824800000081X', '10.1353/book14889', '10.1086/385904', '10.2307/1599128', '10.5149/9780807838174_rushforth', '10.1017/CBO9781316718216']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

10.1108/HESWBL-10-2019-0141,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,"""It's a very different world"": work transition and employability of higher education graduates",[],"PurposeThis study addresses the specific topic of transition between higher education and the world of work, taking differences naturally inherent to the individual and to the surrounding micro and macro contexts. With a holistic approach, this paper aimed to provide a deeper understanding about the university-to-work transition process in a period of turbulence and continuous changes in the labour market.Design/methodology/approachThe three research questions that guide this qualitative study are as follows: (1) What are the factors that facilitate the transition to the labour market? (2) What are the factors that constrain the transition to the labour market? (3) What are graduates' perceptions of their employability? To answer these questions, eleven graduates were interviewed about facilitators and barriers of the transition process and perceptions of employability. Data collected from the interviews were then related to categories previously defined from the literature review. Version 12.0 of the NVivo software was used to support the process of data analysis.FindingsOverall, participants' discourse refer to a multidimensional and dynamic perspective of factors related with work transition and employability. The obtained results indicate that the lack of career agency during graduation and professional experiences, together with late career exploration processes, represent possible barriers of transition, especially in study fields with targeted job offers. Likewise, experiences promoting the development of competencies through supportive practice from teachers, mentors and colleagues are referred as facilitators of transition.Practical implicationsOne of the most consistent outcomes of the interviews conducted concerns the importance of a stronger focus on developing practical experiences during higher education studies. This empirical study demonstrated how this type of experience can mitigate the impact of the transition from university to the labour market.Originality/valueThis empirical study demonstrated how work being integrated into learning in curricula can mitigate the impact of the transition from university to the labour market. It offers important insights about possible strategies that could be adopted to promote graduates' employability from a perspective of shared responsibility.","[('Sílvia Monteiro', ''), ('Leandro Almeida', ''), ('Adela García-Aracil', '')]","['10.1007/978-1-4020-5926-1_4', '10.1007/978-94-007-1353-6', '10.1108/CDI-08-2016-0135', '10.1111/1467-8624.00273', '10.1080/13639080701314613', '10.1080/02680930903349489', '10.1080/07294360802444347', '10.1007/s10775-007-9132-6', '10.1108/00400910710754435', '10.1007/s10212-012-0122-9', '10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.11.223', '10.1108/HESWBL-09-2014-0044', '10.1080/13538320120059990', '10.1002/ir.160', '10.1080/07294360.2016.1229270', '10.1108/HESWBL-08-2018-0086', '10.1080/1356251032000052294', '10.1002/j.2161-0045.1999.tb00739.x', '10.1016/j.jvb.2013.07.001', '10.1080/03043790500087571', '10.1108/HESWBL-09-2015-0048', '10.1177/1469787409343189', '10.1002/j.1556-6678.2010.tb00006.x', '10.1186/1472-6920-11-99', '10.1787/eag-2018-en', '10.1108/HESWBL-04-2018-0049', '10.1108/HESWBL-10-2018-0098', '10.1177/1469787414544875', '10.1080/14616696.2013.821619', '10.1002/nur.4770180211', '10.1016/j.jvb.2009.04.004', '10.1027/1015-5759.22.1.28', '10.1177/1469787404040457', '10.1016/j.jvb.2014.10.005', '10.1002/job.712', '10.1080/13639080701650164', '10.1080/13562517.2014.901951', '10.1016/j.edurev.2010.10.003', '10.1002/job.646']",Emerald

Sophisticated predictions of lithology and porosity are being made from seismic data in reservoirs with good borehole log and core calibration for detailed integration with structural, palaeoenvironmental and sequence stratigraphic interpretations. Geologists can now characterize entire carbonate platform systems and their large-scale evolution in time and space, including systems with few outcrop analogues such as the Lower Cretaceous Central Atlantic ‘pre-salt’ carbonates. The papers introduced in this review illustrate opportunities, workflows and potential pitfalls of modern carbonate seismic interpretation. They demonstrate advances in knowledge of carbonate systems achieved when geologists and geophysicists collaborate and innovate to maximize the value of seismic data from acquisition, through processing to interpretation. Future trends and developments, including machine learning and the significance of the energy transition, are briefly discussed.","[('James Hendry', 'Iapetus Geoscience Ltd, Unit 7, Watson &amp; Johnson Centre, Mill Road, Greystones, Co.

10.1093/pastj/gtaa028,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,OUT OF THE WEST: FORMATION OF A PERMANENT PLAGUE RESERVOIR IN SOUTH-CENTRAL GERMANY (1349-1356) AND ITS IMPLICATIONS,[],"Abstract This article deals with the origins and spread of the second outbreak of fourteenth-century plague pandemic, the pestis secunda, which swept over West Eurasia and North Africa between 1356 and 1366. Unlike the Black Death, its immediate predecessor, which seems to have originated in Central Asia, the pestis secunda emerged in Central Germany, most likely in the Frankfurt region, in summer 1356. Having seeded its new reservoir, the plague radiated from Central Germany, a landlocked region, into other parts of West Eurasia and North Africa, via inland routes. The inland mode of transmission is at odds with the geographic spread of the Black Death, whereby the plague arrived in West Eurasian and North African ports via maritime trade routes. To appreciate the appearance of the Central Germany plague reservoir in the early 1350s, the wider ecological, climatic and socio-economic context of the Frankfurt region is scrutinized, on the basis of textual, palaeoclimatic and palaeogenetic evidence. Although beyond the remit of this article, it argues that the Central German reservoir may have become the origin of recurrent late-medieval and early-modern plague outbreaks.","[('Philip Slavin', 'University of Stirling')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)
10.1093/pastj/gtaa005,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,"FAMILY STANDARDS OF LIVING OVER THE LONG RUN, ENGLAND 1280-1850",[],"Abstract This article uses new wage series for men, women and children in combination with an established cost of living index and standard assumptions about family size to construct a measure of family welfare in England, 1280–1850. It asks whether this family could achieve a standard of living historically defined as ‘respectable’. It extracts information from primary and secondary sources to make adjustments for the participation rates of women and children, the varying number of days worked over time, the changing involvement of married women in paid work, and the evolving occupational structure. The resulting series is the first to depict the living standard of a representative working family over the very long run. Prior to the Black Death, this family existed just above subsistence; afterwards shortage of labour brought substantial albeit not unassailable gains. Tudor-era turmoil and constraints on women’s work pushed the family below the ‘respectable’ standard. From the mid 1600s however, the gradual transformation of the economy coincided with improved welfare. Over these centuries, it was rare for men’s work alone to sustain the family at a respectable level; women and children’s earnings were necessary. This article calls for a re-evaluation of the chronology, causes and consequences of long-run growth.","[('Sara Horrell', 'London School of Economics'), ('Jane Humphries', 'University of Oxford and London School of Economics'), ('Jacob Weisdorf', 'University of Oxford and London School of Economics')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Unfortunately, neural networks are known to suffer from various safety and security issues. Formal verification is a promising avenue for tackling this difficulty, by formally certifying that networks are correct. We propose an SMT-based technique for verifyingbinarized neural networks— a popular kind of neural network, where some weights have been binarized in order to render the neural network more memory and energy efficient, and quicker to evaluate. One novelty of our technique is that it allows the verification of neural networks that include both binarized and non-binarized components. Neural network verification is computationally very difficult, and so we propose here various optimizations, integrated into our SMT procedure as deduction steps, as well as an approach for parallelizing verification queries. We implement our technique as an extension to the Marabou framework, and use it to evaluate the approach on popular binarized neural network architectures.","[('Guy Amir', ''), ('Haoze Wu', ''), ('Clark Barrett', ''), ('Guy Katz', '')]","['10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_5', '10.1007/978-3-030-44534-8_10', '10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_11', '10.1109/CVPR.2012.6248110', '10.7249/R366', '10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19', '10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_3', '10.1109/SP.2018.00058', '10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_5', '10.1007/978-3-030-55754-6_5', '10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_1', '10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1', '10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_3', '10.1109/DASC.2016.7778091', '10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5', '10.4204/EPTCS.257.3', '10.1007/s10703-021-00363-7', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26', '10.1145/3341216.3342218', '10.1609/aaai.v29i1.9513', '10.1609/aaai.v32i1.12206', '10.1007/978-3-319-46493-0_32', '10.1007/s10994-021-06050-2', '10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_2', '10.1109/CVPR.2019.00748', '10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11623']",Springer International Publishing

This article analyses internal regional variation and shows that certain economic and social factors mitigated gender discrimination against newborn and/or young girls. In particular, the presence of wage labour opportunities for women and the prevalence of extended families in which different generations of women cohabited had beneficial effects on girls’ survival. Likewise, infant and child sex ratios were lower in dense, more urbanized areas.","[('Francisco J.

We use physical models to investigate the impact of base-salt relief on deformation patterns. First, we investigate early-stage gravity gliding across base-salt relief. Salt flowing onto structural high blocks forms a zone of thickened salt and associated shortening owing to a flux mismatch. On the downdip edge of the basement high another flux mismatch generates a topographic monocline (ramp-syncline basin) with associated extensional and contractional hinges. With multiple base-salt high blocks, this structural pattern was repeated down the entire slope. Laterally discontinuous base-salt relief generated additional complexities such as major rotations of raft blocks and intervening diapirs as salt is channelled around and between base-salt relief. At the allochthonous level, regional dip, salt budget and base-salt relief influence flow patterns. Individual salt sheets spread sub-radially with streamlines skewed down the regional slope. As the canopy coalesced along allosutures, inward flow from the canopy peripheries dominated, driven by more vigorous flow from outer feeders owing to less competition for source-layer salt. Subsequent shortening returned flow patterns to grossly dip-parallel. However, salt flows fastest where it is thickest and thus chains of feeders channel rapid intracanopy flow.","[('Tim P.

10.1093/pastj/gtz032,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,THE UNITED STATES AS A DEVELOPING NATION: REVISITING THE PECULIARITIES OF AMERICAN HISTORY,[],"Abstract It has recently been suggested that the economic departure of the United States after the Civil War marked a ‘Second Great Divergence’. Compared to the ‘First’, the rise of Britain during the Industrial Revolution, this Second Great Divergence is curiously little understood: because the United States remains the template for modernization narratives, its trajectory is more easily accepted as preordained than interrogated as an unlikely historical outcome. But why should development have been problematic everywhere but the United States? This Viewpoint argues that a robust explanation for the United States's rise is lacking: it can neither be found in an economic history literature focused on factor endowments nor in internalist Americanist historiography, which often reproduces overdetermined accounts of modernization inspired by Max Weber. The most promising avenue of inquiry, we argue, lies in asking how American political institutions configured what should properly be called an American developmental state. Such a perspective opens up a broad comparative research agenda that provincializes the United States from the perspective of development experiences elsewhere.","[('Stefan Link', 'Dartmouth College'), ('Noam Maggor', 'Queen Mary University of London')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)
10.1093/pastj/gtz029,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,THE BATTLE OF MUHAMMAD MAHMOUD STREET IN CAIRO: THE POLITICS AND POETICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE IN REVOLUTIONARY TIME,[],"Abstract The battle of Muhammad Mahmoud Street in November 2011, pitching protestors against security forces in a five-day long stand-off, represented a crucial episode of Egypt's 25 January Revolution. Part riot and part carnival, this event opens up a number of questions for historians. This article examines the battle on three distinct scales, paying particular attention to time and temporality. The first scale is the battle's position within the temporality of the Egyptian revolution. The article argues that revolutionary situations are best understood through concepts of liminal time, and that the winter of 2011, rather than the initial stage of the Tahrir Square sit-in in January–February, represented the crucial phase of the revolutionary process in Egypt. A second scale zooms in on street action, focusing on the nexus of class, masculinity and urban violence. Here, raw experiences on the ground inform subjective meanings of ‘violence', ‘politics' and ‘revolution' from the perspective of those who were most directly involved in their making. These experiences also reveal different temporal horizons experienced by diverse participants, which, however, did not remain unchanged as events unfolded. The third scale is historically comparative, delving into spontaneously enacted riotous and carnivalesque urban violence as reflected in classic literature on riots and carnivals in different contexts. The battle of November 2011 allow us to see the generic affinity between these liminal events and the persistence of the riotous and carnivalesque within modern revolutionary situations, as it may help us understand the resurgence of riots within the contemporary world.","[('Lucie Ryzova', 'University of Birmingham')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Focusing on the experiences of young women growing up in Britain between 1950 and 1980, this article argues that changes in sexual practice were brought about by shifts in the social value of sexual knowledge and experience. While the figure of the ‘nice girl’ was still central to understandings of respectable femininity, across this period social status and reputation became linked to demonstrations of attractiveness and sexual knowing. For girls of the post-war generation, discussions of sex were central to how they related to those around them, and the decisions that teenagers made about their own sexual practice were informed by their perceptions of what their friends and peers would think of them. The article argues that, by considering the history of sexuality at a ‘local’ scale between the macro-level of culture and the micro-level of individual sexual selfhood, we not only gain an important new perspective on the everyday sexual experience but also uncover new processes of socio-sexual change.","[('HANNAH CHARNOCK', '')]","['10.1080/09612029400200044', '10.1080/14681810500038848', '10.1080/03071022.2013.872904', '10.1057/9781137328632', '10.7228/manchester/9780719084553.001.0001', '10.4324/9780203357057', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199605194.001.0001', '10.1093/tcbh/hwq048', '10.4324/9780203956809', '10.1080/0954025022000020063', '10.1017/S0018246X1600011X', '10.1080/0013191790310302', '10.1093/tcbh/hww051', '10.1086/493411', '10.2307/588234', '10.1177/0022009405051556', '10.1002/9781118349229', '10.1017/CBO9780511778353', '10.1177/001789697103000102', '10.1080/13619462.2016.1206822', '10.1007/978-1-349-21168-5']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

The competition evaluated 59 verification systems and 17 validation systems from 34 teams from 12 countries. This yields a good overview of the state of the art in tools for software verification. The competition was executed on a benchmark set with 30 300 verification tasks for C programs and 587 . verification tasks for Java programs.

10.1111/nana.12650,NATIONS AND NATIONALISM,0603 World History; 0304 Ethnology; 0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,Nationalism in the 21st century: Neo-tribal or plural?,[],"AbstractNations are faced today with a new set of social and economic challenges: economic globalisation has intensified bringing with it a more intense phase of cultural interconnectedness and political interdependence. Nation‐states see their sovereign powers eroded and are transformed to post‐national states as the political space they govern is no longer congruent with the socio‐economic space which transcends the national borders. Nonetheless, the nation continues to be a powerful source of identity and legitimacy. We are actually witnessing in Europe and worldwide a comeback of nationalism oftentimes in an aggressive, nativist and populist guise. This paper seeks to offer a new analytical lens through which to make sense of this new tide of nationalism. It therefore reviews critically the ethnic vs civic and perennialist, primordialist, modernist and ethnosymbolist approaches to suggest that they are no longer fit for purpose in explaining where nations and nationalism come from and where they are headed to. The paper proposes a new analytical framework which distinguishes between plural and neo‐tribal nationalism, focusing on how nations interact with diversity and permeability in the 21st century context.","[('Anna Triandafyllidou', 'Ryerson University Faculty of Arts ‐ Sociology 350 Victoria street dept of Sociology, Faculty of Arts Toronto Toronto Ontario Canada')]","['10.1093/oso/9780195072334.001.0001', '10.1002/9780470997116.ch9', '10.1068/d1509', '10.1080/1070289X.2018.1494968', '10.1057/978-1-137-58987-3_11', '10.1111/spsr.12260', '10.1057/978-1-137-58987-3_12', '10.21104/CL.2016.1.03', '10.4324/9780203960899', '10.1080/15348431.2016.1179189', '10.1177/1463499616652513', '10.1080/01419870.2015.1058503', '10.1080/13608746.2011.605612', '10.1111/nana.12515', '10.1017/CBO9780511612107', '10.1057/978-1-137-58987-3_13', '10.1186/s40878-018-0082-6', '10.1080/15562948.2017.1317895', '10.1111/j.1751-9020.2011.00387.x', '10.1080/096922997347715', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00498.x', '10.1111/j.1467-923X.2003.00584.x', '10.1111/0162-895X.00337', '10.1515/9781503612846', '10.4324/9780203876558', '10.4324/9780203217511', '10.1515/9781400820849', '10.1080/1369183X.2016.1251013', '10.1080/014198798329784', '10.4324/9780203167496', '10.1057/9780230390898_7', '10.1080/07036337.2013.848206', '10.1007/978-1-137-56065-0', '10.1177/1468796813483287', '10.1515/9780748644537', '10.4324/9780203867549', '10.1515/9780804766036']",Wiley

Detrital zircon dating is a technique that is increasingly applied to sedimentary provenance studies. However, sand routing information using zircon analysis alone may be obscured by repeated sedimentary reworking cycles and mineral fertility variations. These biases are illustrated by two clear case studies from the Triassic–Jurassic of the Barents Shelf where the use of U–Pb geochronology on apatite and rutile and Pb–Pb isotopic data from K-feldspar is highly beneficial for provenance interpretations. In the first case study, U–Pb apatite ages from the (Induan – Norian) Havert, Kobbe and Snadd formations indicate an evolving provenance and identify possible episodes of storage within foreland basins prior to delivery onto the Barents Shelf. In the second case study, U–Pb rutile and Pb isotopic analyses of K-feldspar from the Norian–Pliensbachian Realgrunnen Subgroup provide a clear distinction between north Norwegian Caledonides and Fennoscandian Shield sources and suggest that a similar approach may be used to test competing models for sand dispersal for this Subgroup in regions farther north than this study.","[('Michael J.

In this paper we propose Qbricks, a formal verification environment for circuit-building quantum programs, featuring both parametric specifications and a high degree of proof automation. We propose a logical framework based on first-order logic, and develop the main tool we rely upon for achieving the automation of proofs of quantum specification: PPS, a parametric extension of the recently developed path sum semantics. To back-up our claims, we implement and verify parametric versions of several famous and non-trivial quantum algorithms, including the quantum parts of Shor’s integer factoring, quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Grover’s search.","[('Christophe Chareton', ''), ('Sébastien Bardin', ''), ('François Bobot', ''), ('Valentin Perrelle', ''), ('Benoît Valiron', '')]","['10.4204/EPTCS.287.1', '10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_1', '10.1038/s41586-019-1666-5', '10.26421/QIC3.2-8', '10.1109/ISMVL.2019.00026', '10.1038/nature23474', '10.1145/3385412.3386007', '10.4204/EPTCS.195.6', '10.4086/toc.2018.v014a011', '10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.3408', '10.1145/242223.242257', '10.1098/rspa.1998.0164', '10.1017/9781316219317', '10.4204/EPTCS.318.6', '10.4204/EPTCS.287.5', '10.1126/science.1057726', '10.1007/978-3-540-73368-3_21', '10.1007/s10703-016-0243-x', '10.1007/978-3-540-70545-1_51', '10.1103/RevModPhys.86.153', '10.1007/s00224-018-9872-3', '10.1145/2499370.2462177', '10.1145/237814.237866', '10.1109/TCAD.2019.2897703', '10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502', '10.1145/3434318', '10.1145/3307650.3322213', '10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_22', '10.1016/j.tcs.2009.07.045', '10.1145/3428218', '10.1007/978-3-030-25543-5_12', '10.1109/FOCS.2018.00033', '10.1145/3428198', '10.1007/s10817-019-09518-y', '10.1007/978-3-319-59936-6_7', '10.1145/3009837.3009894', '10.4204/EPTCS.287.17', '10.4204/EPTCS.266.8', '10.1017/S0960129506005238', '10.23919/DATE.2018.8341993', '10.22331/q-2018-01-31-49', '10.1145/3183895.3183901', '10.1109/MC.2016.293', '10.1145/2699415', '10.1145/2049706.2049708', '10.1007/s00165-018-0465-3', '10.1145/2629680', '10.1145/3009837.3009840']",Springer International Publishing
10.1017/S0020859019000774,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Women and Gender in the Mines: Challenging Masculinity Through History: An Introduction,[],"AbstractThe role of women as mineworkers and as household workers has been erased. Here, we challenge the masculinity associated with the mines, taking a longer-term and a global labour history perspective. We foreground the importance of women as mineworkers in different parts of the world since the early modern period and analyse the changes introduced in coal mining in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the masculinization and mechanization, and the growing importance of women in contemporary artisanal and small-scale mining. The effect of protective laws and the exclusion of women from underground tasks was to restrict women's work more to the household, which played a pivotal role in mining communities but is insufficiently recognized. This process of “de-labourization” of women's work was closely connected with the distinction between productive and unproductive labour. This introductory article therefore centres on the important work carried out in the household by women and children. Finally, we present the three articles in this Special Theme and discuss how each of them is in dialogue with the topics addressed here. Many thanks also to Marie-José Spreeuwenberg for her invaluable engagement.","[('Rossana Barragán Romano', ''), ('Leda Papastefanaki', '')]","['10.1017/S0147547906000093', '10.1353/crb.2015.0004', '10.1017/S0147547909000064', '10.17159/2413-3027/2017/v30n2a3', '10.2307/27516230', '10.3167/9781785339110', '10.14237/ebl.9.1.2018.1079', '10.1007/BF03376906', '10.36019/9780813563695', '10.1016/j.resourpol.2007.03.002', '10.1002/j.1834-4461.2006.tb03041.x', '10.1017/S0020859011000502', '10.1215/15476715-7323601', '10.2307/j.ctt1zxsmqx.6', '10.5406/jamerethnhist.30.4.0044', '10.1017/S0018246X09990100', '10.1057/fr.2008.5', '10.1080/09614520600562488', '10.1080/0966369X.2012.737770', '10.2307/42635925', '10.1080/0966369X.2011.572433', '10.3917/lms.249.0091', '10.1080/13552074.2015.1095560', '10.1017/S0020859008003453', '10.2752/174063109X380017', '10.1016/j.resourpol.2008.12.001', '10.1515/9781782041870', '10.1017/S0010417511000454', '10.14430/arctic4202', '10.3098/ah.2018.092.3.328', '10.1080/13552074.2017.1379780', '10.1080/13547860.2014.880287', '10.4000/bifea.8354', '10.3197/096734007780473500', '10.1111/wusa.12423', '10.1215/15476715-7323613', '10.1080/13552074.2017.1379775', '10.1080/1081602X.2014.933999', '10.1016/j.resourpol.2013.11.002', '10.1007/s11077-009-9091-5', '10.1007/978-1-349-73399-6_12', '10.22459/LMLP.10.2017.11', '10.2307/j.ctv6gqt3h.11', '10.1177/000203971404900201', '10.1017/S0008938914001939', '10.1007/978-1-349-73399-6', '10.1017/S0147547906000032', '10.1215/00182168-1902778', '10.1177/097152310801500204', '10.2307/j.ctt4cgrkb.5', '10.1177/0376983614544573', '10.1163/9789004360433_011', '10.1080/07075332.2017.1395761', '10.1177/004908570703700403', '10.1093/hwj/dbt012', '10.5117/9789462984363', '10.1016/j.exis.2014.08.004', '10.1086/651039', '10.1080/00020180701482701', '10.2307/j.ctt4cgn2r', '10.1007/s10761-011-0166-6', '10.1086/665962', '10.1080/19472498.2013.768846']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)
10.1007/s11698-021-00224-7,CLIOMETRICA,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,The significance of climate variability on early modern European grain prices,[],"AbstractGrain was the most important food source in early modern Europe (c. 1500–1800), and its price influenced the entire economy. The extent to which climate variability determined grain price variations remains contested, and claims of solar cycle influences on prices are disputed. We thoroughly reassess these questions, within a framework of comprehensive statistical analysis, by employing an unprecedentedly large grain price data set together with state-of-the-art palaeoclimate reconstructions and long meteorological series. A highly significant negative grain price–temperature relationship (i.e. colder = high prices and vice versa) is found across Europe. This association increases at larger spatial and temporal scales and reaches a correlation of$$-\,0.41$$-0.41considering the European grain price average and previous year June–August temperatures at annual resolution, and of$$-\,0.63$$-0.63at decadal timescales. This strong relationship is of episodic rather than periodic (cyclic) nature. Only weak and spatially inconsistent signals of hydroclimate (precipitation and drought), and no meaningful association with solar variations, are detected in the grain prices. The significant and persistent temperature effects on grain prices imply that this now rapidly changing climate element has been a more important factor in European economic history, even in southern Europe, than commonly acknowledged.","[('Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist', ''), ('Peter Thejll', ''), ('Bo Christiansen', ''), ('Andrea Seim', ''), ('Claudia Hartl', ''), ('Jan Esper', '')]","['10.1017/S1361491600000125', '10.1163/24523666-00401006', '10.1017/S002205070009865X', '10.2307/2342284', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00540.x', '10.4324/9781315655321', '10.1006/exeh.1996.0025', '10.1023/A:1005502518695', '10.1017/S1361491601000119', '10.1038/347164a0', '10.1017/S0022050719000524', '10.2307/2341183', '10.5194/cp-15-1-2019', '10.1016/j.palaeo.2011.10.014', '10.1002/joc.1836', '10.1016/j.eeh.2014.12.001', '10.3354/cr00848', '10.26530/OAPEN_587970', '10.18172/cig.3395', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00492.x', '10.1017/CBO9781139031110', '10.1007/s10584-016-1797-8', '10.1007/s10584-017-1931-2', '10.1086/596640', '10.1038/034100c0', '10.1016/j.eeh.2012.09.002', '10.1175/JCLI4107.1', '10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00814.1', '10.1002/2016RG000521', '10.1175/2008JCLI2301.1', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00564.x', '10.1177/095968369700700314', '10.1007/s12685-016-0152-3', '10.2307/203061', '10.1007/s10584-009-9724-x', '10.1126/science.192.4245.1189', '10.1080/03585520802631592', '10.1016/j.dendro.2012.11.002', '10.1007/s00445-013-0736-z', '10.3354/cr01449', '10.1017/S1361491610000146', '10.3354/cr032025', '10.1002/jqs.1302', '10.1029/2009RG000282', '10.1126/science.272.5264.981', '10.1098/rsta.2002.1111', '10.4159/harvard.9780674332157', '10.18261/ISSN1894-3195-2015-03-04', '10.1098/rstl.1801.0015', '10.1515/9780691187204', '10.1093/oso/9780195094138.001.0001', '10.1007/978-3-319-54337-6_3', '10.1016/j.jhg.2017.05.011', '10.1177/0959683616646188', '10.1038/019033d0', '10.1038/019588a0', '10.1007/978-1-4757-3365-5_4', '10.5194/gmd-10-4005-2017', '10.1214/14-AOAS753', '10.1162/JINH_a_00573', '10.1038/252002a0', '10.24894/978-3-7965-3447-8', '10.1023/A:1005590115970', '10.1016/j.jastp.2019.01.012', '10.1017/9781108355780.003', '10.1038/nature17418', '10.1016/j.jas.2018.08.006', '10.1088/1748-9326/ab2c7e', '10.1002/wcc.691', '10.1002/grl.50846', '10.1002/qj.49710042511', '10.1007/978-1-4757-3365-5_10', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0088(19970615)17:7<667::AID-JOC115>3.0.CO;2-J', '10.3197/096734011X13150366551652', '10.1038/s41550-018-0638-2', '10.1007/s00357-014-9161-z', '10.1017/S0022050700017903', '10.3390/agriculture6030029', '10.1029/2002JA009390', '10.1017/CBO9780511496820', '10.1023/A:1005585931899', '10.1002/2016JD025034', '10.1163/9789004615472', '10.2307/2979211', '10.1007/978-3-319-55953-7', '10.1103/PhysRevLett.73.951', '10.1007/s11207-004-5356-5', '10.1017/S0956793313000186', '10.1111/1468-0289.12012', '10.1016/S0167-2789(00)00043-9', '10.1038/276348a0', '10.1017/CBO9781139104234', '10.1007/s11207-015-0815-8', '10.1007/s00382-014-2331-1', '10.1162/JINH_a_01050', '10.1029/2000JD000148', '10.1163/ej.9789004194397.i-464', '10.1163/9789004476127', '10.1017/S136149169900009X', '10.1038/ngeo2962', '10.1080/01621459.1963.10500845', '10.1057/978-1-137-43020-5_27', '10.1017/CBO9780511599637.009']",Springer Science and Business Media LLC

It formed between the northern leading edge of the Taurides platform and the Kırşehir block since Late Cretaceous time. We have constructed five regional cross-sections supported by field data and 2D seismic to constrain the structure of the basin and its evolution. The area is divided into three tectonic domains from south to north: (1) a Maastrichtian to Eocene north-verging fold-and-thrust belt, which terminates by a regional Eocene evaporitic level; (2) an Oligo-Miocene salt domain which contains two generations of minibasins separated by a salt canopy, forming a salt-and-thrust belt; and (3) a late Miocene to present day foreland basin. The cross-sections show the along-strike variations and the increasing shortening in the fold-and-thrust belt from west ( c. 15 km) to east ( c. 25 km). The thick salt allows for the intracutaneous propagation of the fold-and-thrust belt below a domain of salt withdrawal minibasins, decoupled as the initial salt thickness increases. In that case, the salt domain is thrusted both frontward and backward. Efficient exhumation followed by erosion of the fold-and-thrust resulted in synorogenic salt tectonics in the foreland and thus increased the mechanical resistance between them.","[('Etienne Legeay', 'E2S UPPA CNRS/TOTAL/Univ Pau &amp; Pays Adour, Laboratoire Des Fluides Complexes Et Leurs Reservoirs-IPRA, UMR5150, Pau, France'), ('Etienne Legeay', 'Total SA, CSTJF, Pau, France'), ('Jean-Claude Ringenbach', 'Total SA, CSTJF, Pau, France'), ('Charlie Kergaravat', 'Total SA, CSTJF, Pau, France'), ('Alexandre Pichat', 'E2S UPPA CNRS/TOTAL/Univ Pau &amp; Pays Adour, Laboratoire Des Fluides Complexes Et Leurs Reservoirs-IPRA, UMR5150, Pau, France'), ('Alexandre Pichat', 'Total SA, CSTJF, Pau, France'), ('Geoffroy Mohn', 'Géosciences Environnement Cergy, Université de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France'), ('Jaume Vergés', 'Group of Dynamics of the Lithosphere, Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera, ICTJA-CSIC, Barcelona, Spain'), ('Kaan Sevki Kavak', 'Department of Geological Engineering, Sivas Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey'), ('Jean-Paul Callot', 'E2S UPPA CNRS/TOTAL/Univ Pau &amp; Pays Adour, Laboratoire Des Fluides Complexes Et Leurs Reservoirs-IPRA, UMR5150, Pau, France')]","['10.1007/s00531-005-0481-4', '10.1046/j.1365-2117.2003.00194.x', '10.1144/GSL.SP.1998.134.01.04', '10.1029/2002TC001458', '10.1016/j.jsg.2006.06.012', '10.1144/SP372.8', '10.1016/j.tecto.2014.05.039', '10.1016/j.tecto.2003.11.014', '10.1016/B978-0-12-444170-5.50013-0', '10.1007/978-3-540-69426-7_16', '10.1144/SP363.27', '10.2113/gssgfbull.185.1.33', '10.1306/03101614087', '10.1016/B978-0-12-809417-4.00019-7', '10.1016/j.lithos.2005.02.005', '10.1016/0040-1951(91)90142-F', '10.1086/314379', '10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2004.01.008', '10.1016/S0191-8141(01)00169-9', '10.1130/0016-7606(2000)112<351:MOTFAD>2.0.CO;2', '10.1016/S0191-8141(03)00004-X', '10.1029/JB089iB12p10087', '10.1029/2017TC004954', '10.1016/j.jsg.2016.05.009', '10.1029/JB088iB02p01153', '10.1016/0040-1951(85)90033-2', '10.1130/0016-7606(1999)111<1192:SAPOTO>2.3.CO;2', '10.1016/j.jsg.2017.02.002', '10.1016/j.jsg.2018.06.024', '10.1016/j.jsg.2015.03.002', '10.1016/j.jsg.2017.01.008', '10.1130/G33531.1', '10.1016/B978-0-12-809417-4.00020-3', '10.1111/j.1365-2117.2004.00236.x', '10.1306/06010403012', '10.1016/j.jsg.2018.07.022', '10.1007/BF01764576', '10.1016/0037-0738(86)90019-9', '10.1080/00206819809465241', '10.1016/j.crte.2008.01.005', '10.1016/j.tecto.2012.01.027', '10.1016/S0264-8172(02)00121-6', '10.1080/00206819709465371', '10.1016/j.jseaes.2004.08.002', '10.1002/2016TC004206', '10.5194/se-9-295-2018', '10.1046/j.1365-2117.1998.00073.x', '10.1111/bre.12037', '10.1029/2006JB004362', '10.1029/2017TC004928', '10.1130/G22798A.1', '10.1144/0070899', '10.1144/jgs.158.2.367', '10.1029/2008TC002418', '10.1144/SP340.18', '10.1002/2016TC004186', '10.1016/j.jsg.2017.07.007', '10.1016/S0040-1951(97)00176-5', '10.1007/978-3-540-69426-7_20', '10.1017/S0016756816000078', '10.2475/ajs.272.4.293', '10.1029/2018TC005114', '10.1080/17445647.2018.1514539', '10.1111/j.1365-2117.2011.00531.x', '10.35767/gscpgbull.44.2.001', '10.1130/G33591.1', '10.1038/ngeo1902', '10.1130/0091-7613(1997)025<0427:TGCBEA>2.3.CO;2', '10.1144/SP372.9', '10.1111/bre.12300', '10.1144/GSL.SP.1999.156.01.22', '10.1016/j.tecto.2008.08.006', '10.1016/0264-8172(96)00006-2', '10.1016/j.jog.2012.06.012', '10.1016/j.sedgeo.2016.03.025', '10.1111/ter.12306', '10.1016/j.tecto.2009.04.003', '10.1080/00206819709465366', '10.1007/s00531-015-1248-1', '10.1111/jmg.12034', '10.1007/s00531-015-1226-7', '10.1111/sed.12195', '10.1111/bre.12171', '10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2018.03.018', '10.3997/1365-2397.2013016', '10.1016/S0024-4937(02)00160-3', '10.1016/0031-0182(91)90140-M', '10.1144/petgeo2011-091', '10.1144/SP372.16', '10.1016/j.jsg.2011.12.012', '10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2006.08.003', '10.1306/01150302012', '10.1016/j.jsg.2015.04.002', '10.1016/0040-1951(81)90275-4', '10.1016/j.jsg.2005.05.010', '10.1029/2004TC001766', '10.4154/GC.2013.07', '10.1144/GSL.SP.1999.174.01.08', '10.1080/00206819709465374', '10.1002/gj.3350280304', '10.1002/2015TC004018', '10.1007/978-94-011-3066-0_23', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.11.003', '10.1016/0031-9201(86)90021-X', '10.1002/1099-1034(200004/06)35:2<53::AID-GJ837>3.0.CO;2-6', '10.1016/j.jseaes.2005.02.006', '10.1016/j.jseaes.2016.05.021']",Geological Society of London

For large messages, this capability is designed to achieve reduction bandwidths similar to those of point-to-point messages of the same size, and complements the latency-optimized low-latency aggregation reduction capabilities, aimed at small data reductions. MPI_Allreduce() bandwidth measured on an HDR InfiniBand based system achieves about 95% of network bandwidth. For medium and large data reduction this also improves the reduction bandwidth by a factor of 2–5 relative to host-based (e.g., software-based) reduction algorithms. Using this capability also increased DL-Poly and PyTorch application performance by as much as 4% and 18%, respectively. This paper describes SHARP Streaming-Aggregation hardware architecture and a set of synthetic and application benchmarks used to study this new reduction capability, and the range of data sizes for which Streaming-Aggregation performs better than the low-latency aggregation algorithm.","[('Richard L.

Land cover classification is essential basic information and key parameters for environmental change research, geographical and national monitoring, and sustainable development planning. Deep learning can automatically and multi-level extract the features of complex features, which has been proven to be an effective method for information extraction. However, one of the major challenges of deep learning is its poor interpret-ability, which makes it difficult to understand and explain the reasoning behind its classification results. This paper proposes a deep cross-modal coupling model (CMCM) for integrating semantic features and visual features. The representation of knowledge map is indicatively introduced into remote sensing image classification. Compared to previous studies, the proposed method provides accurate descriptions of the complex semantic objects within a complex land cover environment. The results showed that the integration of semantic knowledge improved the accuracy and interpret-ability of land cover classification.","[('J. Chen', ''), ('X. Du', ''), ('J. Zhang', ''), ('Y.

Paracosm allows users to programmatically describe complex driving situations with specific features, e.g., road layouts and environmental conditions, as well as reactive temporal behaviors of other cars and pedestrians. A systematic exploration of the state space, both for visual features and for reactive interactions with the environment is made possible. We define a notion of test coverage for parameter configurations based on combinatorial testing and low dispersion sequences. Using fuzzing on parameter configurations, our automatic test generator can maximize coverage of various behaviors and find problematic cases. Through empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the capabilities of Paracosm in programmatically modeling parameterized test environments, and in finding problematic scenarios.","[('Rupak Majumdar', ''), ('Aman Mathur', ''), ('Marcus Pirron', ''), ('Laura Stegner', ''), ('Damien Zufferey', '')]","['10.1145/3180155.3180160', '10.1007/978-3-642-19835-9_21', '10.1145/2970276.2970311', '10.1007/978-3-319-24953-7_35', '10.1007/s10703-017-0286-7', '10.1145/3126521', '10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_17', '10.1007/978-3-319-57288-8_26', '10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_1', '10.1145/3302504.3313351', '10.1109/ACC.2015.7171969', '10.1145/3314221.3314633', '10.1145/3338906.3338942', '10.1145/3293882.3330566', '10.1109/SP.2018.00058', '10.1109/ASE.2019.00013', '10.1007/978-3-319-11164-3_15', '10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1', '10.1007/978-3-540-44833-4_6', '10.1109/ICSE.2019.00108', '10.6028/NIST.SP.800-142', '10.1007/978-1-4302-3748-8', '10.1145/3238147.3238202', '10.1145/3158134', '10.1109/MODELS.2019.00-12', '10.1137/1.9781611970081', '10.1145/3052973.3053009', '10.1145/3132747.3132785', '10.14722/ndss.2017.23404', '10.1016/0895-7177(96)00036-2', '10.24963/ijcai.2018/368 10.24963/ijcai.2018/368', '10.1145/2483760.2483790', '10.1145/2185632.2185653', '10.1145/3180155.3180220', '10.1109/IVS.2018.8500421', '10.1145/3178126.3187004', '10.1145/349299.349331', '10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_22']",Springer International Publishing

We present new U–Pb laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ages of detrital and magmatic zircon from the Saghro, M'Gouna, and Ouarzazate Groups. The siliciclastic deposits of the Saghro Group were deposited in a back-arc setting developed on stretched continental crust of the West African margin. Collision with the Atlas–Meseta domain led to the closure of the back-arc basin before 600 Ma. Time of exhumation and surface exposure of the newly formed Pan-African basement is bracketed to c. 30 Ma owing to the maximum depositional age of 571 ± 4 Ma of the overlying M'Gouna Group. The U–Pb age of 567 ± 4 Ma for the lowermost ignimbrite of the Ouarzazate Group limits the time for the deposition of the M'Gouna Group to less than 4 Ma. The Pan-African orogeny was finished at c. 600 Ma whereas the onset of transtension related to Cadomian back-arc formation was very much younger from c. 570 Ma onwards.","[('Ezzoura Errami', 'Université Cadi Ayyad, Faculté Polydisciplinaire de Safi, B.P. 4162, 46 000 Safi, Morocco'), ('Ulf Linnemann', 'Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany'), ('Mandy Hofmann', 'Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany'), ('Andreas Gärtner', 'Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany'), ('Johannes Zieger', 'Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany'), ('Jessica Gärtner', 'Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany'), ('Katja Mende', 'Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany'), ('Jamal El Kabouri', 'Université Chouaïb Doukkali, Faculté des Sciences, EGGPG, B.P. 20, 24000 El Jadida, Morocco'), ('Dominique Gasquet', 'Laboratoire EDYTEM, Université Savoie Mont Blanc, CNRS-UMR5204, Campus scientifique, 73376, Le Bourget du Lac, France'), ('Nasser Ennih', 'Université Chouaïb Doukkali, Faculté des Sciences, EGGPG, B.P. 20, 24000 El Jadida, Morocco')]","['10.1016/j.precamres.2010.05.018', '10.1016/j.precamres.2012.06.005', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2020.103946', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2014.04.026', '10.1016/j.gr.2011.06.005', '10.1016/0899-5362(90)90105-N', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2016.08.016', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2018.10.008', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.07.044', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2016.08.002', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2014.04.021', '10.1016/j.gr.2020.03.011', '10.1007/s00126-002-0317-0', '10.1016/j.gr.2009.12.006', '10.1016/j.precamres.2006.02.003', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2007.02.003', '10.1016/j.lithos.2012.07.022', '10.1016/j.precamres.2010.06.011', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2019.103669', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2019.103669', '10.1016/j.precamres.2017.12.039', '10.1016/S0301-9268(01)00195-4', '10.1144/SP297.1', '10.1016/S0899-5362(02)00048-9', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2012.04.006', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2009.02.006', '10.2113/0530277', '10.1016/S0899-5362(03)00049-6', '10.1016/S0301-9268(00)00065-6', '10.1016/j.chemgeo.2008.07.025', '10.1016/j.precamres.2005.06.009', '10.1007/978-3-540-77076-3_2', '10.1130/L121.1', '10.1016/j.epsl.2006.06.039', '10.1016/S0040-1951(03)00023-4', '10.1016/S0301-9268(00)00078-4', '10.1016/S0301-9268(02)00109-2', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2014.03.007', '10.1016/j.gr.2020.05.014', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.07.041', '10.1016/j.chemgeo.2004.06.017', '10.1016/j.precamres.2015.03.003', '10.1086/319979', '10.1139/e80-012', '10.1016/0301-9268(94)90019-1', '10.1139/cjes-2017-0086', '10.1029/JB088iS02p0A887', '10.1144/GSL.SP.2000.179.01.10', '10.1007/s00531-004-0413-8', '10.1016/j.precamres.2013.08.007', '10.1007/s00531-017-1520-7', '10.1139/e05-062', '10.1016/j.epsl.2011.09.056', '10.1007/978-3-540-77076-3_1', '10.1016/j.crte.2017.01.001', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2017.11.030', '10.1016/j.precamres.2017.07.007', '10.1016/0899-5362(96)00002-4', '10.1016/j.gr.2012.03.010', '10.1016/j.precamres.2004.08.003', '10.1007/BF00310745', '10.1016/j.cageo.2003.09.006', '10.1016/j.chemgeo.2007.11.005', '10.1016/j.lithos.2013.04.003', '10.2113/174.1.83', '10.1016/j.crte.2018.07.002', '10.1016/0012-821X(75)90088-6', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2009.07.005', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.07.059', '10.1016/S0301-9268(02)00075-X', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.07.046', '10.1130/RF.L001.1', '10.1007/s00710-012-0245-3', '10.1016/j.jog.2015.07.004', '10.1016/j.precamres.2017.10.022', '10.1016/j.precamres.2020.105610', '10.3390/min8120592', '10.1016/0301-9268(94)90094-9', '10.1016/j.precamres.2012.06.010', '10.1007/BF00372872', '10.1016/j.precamres.2013.07.003']",Geological Society of London

Relying on the vocabulary of ‘neurotypical’ and ‘neurodivergent’ persons, the NDM promotes a more inclusive understanding of peoples’ states of mental health, consciousness, and, fundamentally, a way of being. We examine how the arguments of the NDM are reminiscent of other struggles within the broadly defined arena of disability activism, mad pride, and consumer-survivor movements and show how the NDM co-opts medical language to avoid the tradition developed by anti-psychiatrists who fundamentally reject psychiatry altogether.","[('Erika Dyck', ''), ('Ginny Russell', '')]",[],Springer International Publishing

Here we integrate gravity, bathymetry and 2D seismic datasets to investigate the structural and stratigraphic variation in the southern part of the Hikurangi subduction wedge, onshore and offshore North Island, New Zealand. Three morphostructural portions are recognized: The inner portion demonstrates reactivation of inherited structures, producing thick-skinned deformation. Pre-subduction rocks are represented by kilometres of acoustically chaotic seismofacies. Thick-skinned deformation and readily deformable substrate lead to the development of wide trench-slope sub-basins, infilled with &gt;5 km of syn-subduction sediments. The mid portion typically demonstrates thrust faults with connections to deeper structures, leading to the development of an imbricate system with asymmetrical sub-basins typically &lt;5 km thick developed on the back-limb of thrust related folds. An antiformal stack marks the transition from the thick-skinned interior of the basin to the thin-skinned accretionary prism. Beyond this, the relatively non-deformed outer portion demonstrates frontal folds, propagating thrusts and up to 3 km thickness of syn-subduction strata. Structural variation across the subduction wedge controls the generation of accommodation with implications for sediment distribution within fold and thrust belts and for petroleum system development.","[('A.

10.1093/pastj/gtz028,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,THE PATH TO PISTOIA: URBAN HYGIENE BEFORE THE BLACK DEATH,[],"Abstract When the Black Death struck Western Europe in late 1347, city dwellers across the region were already practising public health, in part by building, maintaining and monitoring infrastructures whose prophylactic value emerged from the experience of intensified urbanization. The demands of a new urban metabolism, evident from the twelfth century, prompted numerous cities, including Pistoia, to develop preventative health programmes in anticipation of and in response to diverse threats. The latter certainly included famine, floods, pestilence and war, but Pistoians and others were no less concerned by routine matters such as burials, food quality, travel and work safety, artisanal pollution and domestic waste disposal. All of these were recognized as impacting people’s health, based on the medical and natural-philosophical theories prevalent at the time, and their management took into consideration not only climactic conditions and multi-species behaviour, but also the smooth functioning of sites such as wells, canals, bridges and roads. The political value that municipalities and other stakeholders began to place on the upkeep of these sites exceeded their economic function and thus questions the seminal role that scholars tend to attribute to the second plague pandemic in public health history. It also demonstrates how a key aspect of Euro-American modernity continues to shape interpretations of urban and health histories and suggests a broader path for historicizing community prophylactics.","[('G Geltner', 'University of Amsterdam')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Falsification, given a desired temporal specification, tries to find an input of violation instead of a proof guarantee. The state-of-the-art falsification approaches often employ stochastic hill-climbing optimization that minimizes the degree of satisfaction of the temporal specification, given by its quantitativerobust semantics. However, it has been shown that the performance of falsification could be severely affected by the so-calledscale problem, related to the different scales of the signals used in the specification (e.g., rpm and speed): in the robustness computation, the contribution of a signal could bemaskedby another one. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle this problem. We first introduce a new robustness definition, calledQB-Robustness, which combines classical Boolean satisfaction and quantitative robustness. We prove that QB-Robustness can be used to judge the satisfaction of the specification and avoid the scale problem in its computation. QB-Robustness is exploited by a falsification approach based on Monte Carlo Tree Search over the structure of the formal specification. First, tree traversal identifies the sub-formulas for which it is needed to compute the quantitative robustness. Then, on the leaves, numerical hill-climbing optimization is performed, aiming to falsify such sub-formulas. Our in-depth evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates that our approach achieves better falsification results than the state-of-the-art falsification approaches guided by the classical quantitative robustness, and it is largely not affected by the scale problem.","[('Zhenya Zhang', ''), ('Deyun Lyu', ''), ('Paolo Arcaini', ''), ('Lei Ma', ''), ('Ichiro Hasuo', ''), ('Jianjun Zhao', '')]","['10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483411', '10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_24', '10.4204/EPTCS.257.2', '10.1007/978-3-642-19835-9_21', '10.1145/1985793.1985795', '10.1109/CEC.2005.1554902', '10.1109/TCIAIG.2012.2186810', '10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_18', '10.1007/978-3-319-24953-7_35', '10.1145/3126521', '10.1109/COASE.2017.8256286', '10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_17', '10.1007/978-3-642-15297-9_9', '10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_10', '10.1145/2883817.2883838', '10.1007/978-3-319-57288-8_26', '10.1016/j.tcs.2009.06.021', '10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_29', '10.1145/3302504.3311800', '10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_30', '10.1007/978-3-642-31424-7_34', '10.1145/2562059.2562140', '10.1109/MCS.2016.2602089', '10.1109/PRDC47002.2019.00054', '10.1007/11871842_29', '10.1007/978-3-319-10512-3_11', '10.1109/DASC.2015.7311613', '10.1007/978-3-030-02450-5_6', '10.1016/j.compstruc.2004.03.072', '10.1007/978-3-319-63588-0', '10.1145/2331147.2331165', '10.1038/nature16961', '10.1007/978-3-319-66845-1_1', '10.1007/978-3-319-95582-7_27', '10.1109/TCAD.2020.3013073', '10.1109/TCAD.2018.2858463', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_23', '10.1007/978-3-030-76384-8_24']",Springer International Publishing

It is therefore particularly suitable for the analysis of rifted margins and their associated ocean basins. Maps of crustal thickness and conjugate-margin stretching, derived from gravity anomaly inversion, are used to illustrate how the Equatorial Atlantic opened as a set of stepped rift-transform segments, rather than as a simple orthogonal rifted margin. The influence of the transform faults and associated oceanic fracture zones is particularly clear when the results of the gravity anomaly inversion are combined with a shaded-relief display of the free-air gravity anomaly. A set of crustal cross-sections has been extracted from the results of the gravity inversion along both equatorial margins. These illustrate the crustal structure of both rifted-margin segments and transform-margin segments. The maps and cross-sections are used to delineate crustal type on the margins as (1) inboard, entirely continental, (2) outboard, entirely oceanic and (3) the ocean–continent transition in between where mixed continental and magmatic crust is likely to be present. For a given parameterization of melt generation the amount of magmatic addition within the ocean–continent transition is predicted by the gravity inversion. One of the strengths of the gravity-inversion technique is that these predictions can be made in the absence of any other directly acquired data. On both margins anomalously thick crust is resolved close to a number of oceanic fracture zones. On the South American margin we believe that this thick crust is probably the result of post-break-up magmatism within what was originally normal-thickness oceanic crust. On the West African margin, however, three possible origins are discussed: (1) continental crust extended oceanwards along the fracture zones; (2) oceanic crust magmatically thickened at the fracture zones; and (3) oceanic crust thickened by transpression along the fracture zones. Gravity inversion alone cannot discriminate between these possibilities. The cross-sections also show that, while ‘normal thickness’ oceanic crust ( c. 7 km) predominates regionally, local areas of thinner ( c. 5 km) and thicker ( c. 10 km) oceanic crust are also present along both margins. Finally, using maps of crustal thickness and thinning factor as input to plate reconstructions, the regional palaeogeography of the Equatorial Atlantic during and after break-up is displayed at 10 Ma increments.","[('Nick J.

In this article, I discern five major historiographical directions in contemporary scholarship regarding the history of knowledge. The analytical framework that has so far attracted the most attention is the circulation of knowledge. As productive as it is, the very concept of circulation is in need of both elaboration and theorization. In order to achieve this, I focus on the public circulation of knowledge. This kind of circulation implies that knowledge should be studied as a broad, societal phenomenon. There are a number of possible methodological approaches to study the processes, situations, or contexts where knowledge has or gains public significance. Here I focus on and develop the concept of public arenas of knowledge, which might be virtual, physical, or hybrid spaces. Drawing on several new studies, I demonstrate how different public arenas of knowledge functioned during the postwar period and how they were part of a larger infrastructure of knowledge.","[('JOHAN ÖSTLING', 'Lund University')]",[],Wiley

We look at how violence erupts after revelation of queer sexuality of one of the participants of collective drinking. Discussions of homosexuality in Russia became especially heated after the adoption of the bill against the “propaganda of non‐traditional family values” in 2013. This law primarily marks information about homosexuality as inappropriate and dangerous to minors. We review court decisions on violence against gay men before and after the introduction of this law. The court cases we analyze are not cases of the “propaganda” law enforcement, but routine violent felonies. As we selected only those cases that involve alcohol consumption from a larger sample, we analyze the stories told in these court files focusing on interaction rituals during the practice of collective heavy drinking. We demonstrate how this ritual is centered around confirmation of masculinity, ceremonies of sharing, and exchange of respect. We also show that these ritualized practices are interrupted and confused by introduction of information about one of the participants' queer sexuality. This interruption evolves into violent reactions, including murder. Nevertheless, the ritual of drinking supports both a “conversation of souls” (sharing intimate secrets) and violent reactions to the information that challenges masculinity of the ritual's participants.","[('ALEXANDER SASHA KONDAKOV', ""Assistant Professor at the School of Sociology, University College Dublin, Ireland, and a researcher in the University of Helsinki's major research center in Russian and Eurasian studies, the Aleksanteri Institute, Finland.""), ('EVGENY SHTORN', 'Independent researcher from Dublin (Ireland).')]",[],Wiley

U.S. operations in these two countries became the second- and fourth-largest in the world, creating migration links that resulted in the emergence of American universities, such as the University of Houston, as immigration hubs for the highly selective, student-led South Asian migration stream starting in the 1950s. By the late twentieth century, Houston’s South Asian community had become one of the most prosperous in the metropolitan area and one of the largest in the country. Mining archives and using new oral histories, Uzma Quraishi traces this pioneering community from its midcentury roots to the early twenty-first century, arguing that South Asian immigrants appealed to class conformity and endorsed the model minority myth to navigate the complexities of a shifting Sunbelt South. By examining Indian and Pakistani immigration to a major city transitioning out of Jim Crow, Quraishi reframes our understanding of twentieth-century migration, the changing character of the South, and the tangled politics of race, class, and ethnicity in the United States","[('Uzma Quraishi', '')]",[],University of North Carolina Press

Examining modern astronomy at Mauna Kea, I argue the technoscientific promise of the Thirty Meter Telescope hinges on a temporality of lateness—late to show up and late in time—that contributes to the dehumanization, elimination, and dispossession of Kanaka Maoli, the Indigenous people of Hawai‘i.

Our semantics identifies false program dependencies that might be removed by compiler optimisation, and leaves in place just the dependencies necessary to rule out thin-air reads. We show that our dependency calculation can be used to rule out thin-air reads in any axiomatic concurrency model, in particular C++. We present a tool that automatically evaluates litmus tests, show that we can augment C++ to fix the thin-air problem, and we prove that our augmentation is compatible with the previously used compilation mappings over key processor architectures.

10.1017/S174002282000011X,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Into the bazaar: Indian Ocean vernaculars in the age of global capitalism,[],"AbstractDrawing on a far-flung, multilingual archive of contracts and financial instruments from around the western Indian Ocean, this article highlights how cross-cultural trade depended on the ability of groups to translate between one system and another, rendering one commercial lexicon legible to another so as to produce commensurability and allow for conversions to take place. Law constituted a foundational building block of this process: Indian Ocean merchants drew on a deep well of legal concepts and forms as they attempted to make their worlds legible to one another, mobilizing the grammars of law to bridge commercial systems. We situate these dynamics within the context of the Indian Ocean ‘bazaar’, establishing it as a site for thinking about the place of cross-cultural trade in world history, and the histories of global capitalism more broadly. We suggest that Euro-American capitalism’s very agents had to adapt their commerce to the idioms, logics, and contracts of their business partners around the Indian Ocean – a vernacular world of the bazaar that was itself already in motion.","[('Fahad Bishara', ''), ('Hollian Wint', '')]",[],Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Thus, it is imperative to combine the strengths of verification tools via combinations and cooperation. CoVeriTeam is a language and tool for on-demand composition of cooperative approaches. It provides a systematic and modular way to combine existing tools (without changing them) in order to leverage their full potential. The idea of cooperative verification is that different tools help each other to achieve the goal of correctly solving verification tasks.The language is based on verification artifacts (programs, specifications, witnesses) as basic objects and verification actors (verifiers, validators, testers) as basic operations. We define composition operators that make it possible to easily describe new compositions. Verification artifacts are the interface between the different verification actors. CoVeriTeam consists of a language for composition of verification actors, and its interpreter.As a result of viewing tools as components, we can now create powerful verification engines that are beyond the possibilities of single tools, avoiding to develop certain components repeatedly. We illustrate the abilities of CoVeriTeam on a few case studies. We expect that CoVeriTeam will help verification researchers and practitioners to easily experiment with new tools, and assist them in rapid prototyping of tool combinations.","[('Dirk Beyer', ''), ('Sudeep Kanav', '')]","['10.1007/978-3-540-24756-2_1', '10.1145/1965724.1965743', '10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21', '10.1007/978-3-030-45234-6_25', '10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20', '10.1145/2950290.2950351', '10.1145/3477579', '10.1145/2786805.2786867', '10.1007/978-3-319-92994-1_1', '10.1145/3510003.3510064', '10.1145/2393596.2393664', '10.1007/978-3-030-16722-6_23', '10.1145/3180155.3180259', '10.5281/zenodo.5644953', '10.1007/978-3-030-99429-7_3', '10.1007/978-3-030-31784-3_11', '10.1145/2491411.2491429', '10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y', '10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_10', '10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_8', '10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_1', '10.1109/69.43410', '10.1007/978-3-642-32759-9_13', '10.1007/10722167_15', '10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_3', '10.1145/567752.567778', '10.1007/978-3-642-35873-9_18', '10.1007/978-3-642-54624-2_13', '10.1007/978-3-662-46675-9_7', '10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2', '10.1126/science.275.5296.51', '10.1016/j.dam.2006.04.015', '10.1145/1138912.1138916', '10.1007/978-3-642-11486-1_14', '10.1016/S0065-2458(08)60520-3', '10.1007/978-3-642-30729-4_10', '10.1007/11576280_3', '10.1007/s100090050003']",Springer International Publishing

British rule in India was vulnerable to white ants because these insects consumed paper and wood, the key material foundations of the colonial state. The white ant problem also made the colonial state more resilient and intrusive. The sphere of strict governmental intervention was extended to include both animate and inanimate non-humans, while these insects were invoked as symbols to characterize colonized landscapes, peoples, and cultures. Nonetheless, encounters with white ants were not entirely within the control of the colonial state. Despite effective state intervention, white ants did not vanish altogether, and remained objects of everyday control until the final decade of colonial rule and after. Meanwhile, colonized and post-colonial South Asians used white ants to articulate their own distinct political agendas. Over time, white ants featured variously as metaphors for Islamic decadence, British colonial exploitation, communism, democratic socialism, and, more recently, the Indian National Congress. This article argues that co-constitutive encounters between the worlds of insects and politics have been an intrinsic feature of British colonialism and its legacies in South Asia.","[('ROHAN DEB ROY', '')]","['10.1111/j.0066-4812.2005.00501.x', '10.1093/pastj/gts026', '10.1177/0309132510362932', '10.2307/2842302', '10.1080/09505431.2013.776367', '10.1215/08992363-2007-008', '10.1353/book.3317', '10.7551/mitpress/10492.001.0001', '10.1111/j.1478-0542.2011.00824.x', '10.1080/09505430020025492', '10.7208/chicago/9780226164700.003.0006', '10.7208/chicago/9780226703299.001.0001', '10.1017/S0010417501003644', '10.1086/448839', '10.5962/bhl.title.153213', '10.1093/pastj/gtt026', '10.1017/S0018246X17000073', '10.4324/9780203762011', '10.1177/0096144212449145', '10.1038/026549f0', '10.1525/ah.2005.79.1.27', '10.1093/ahr/120.4.1218', '10.1111/hic3.12093', '10.1086/271693']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Questions are typically focused, concentrated on the meaning of particular constitutional clauses at the moment of their inception: the Commerce Clause in 1787, the Second Amendment in 1791, or the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. Given the prevalence of these investigations, theoretical and methodological debates over how to recover original constitutional meaning are concentrated on either the kind of meaning that should be targeted—original public meaning, original intended meaning, or original legal meaning—or how that meaning can be recovered—through conventional legal reasoning, corpus linguistics, or thick reconstruction of historical context. Regardless, virtually all originalist theories of meaning uncritically presuppose the nature of the object possessing that meaning: they take as given what the Constitution itself is and, by implication, what it has always been. Although it might not be clear what the Constitution originally meant, it is straightforward what the original Constitution originally was. It just is the Constitution.","[('Jonathan Gienapp', '')]","['10.4159/9780674989542', '10.1017/S0738248019000427', '10.4159/harvard.9780674726260.c7']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)
10.1017/S0018246X20000254,HISTORICAL JOURNAL,0603 World History,THE COSMOPOLITAN HISTORIOGRAPHY OF TWENTIETH-CENTURY FEDERALISM,[],"AbstractThis article examines the historiographical debate over federalism between the 1930s and 1960s. In their most sweeping iterations, revisionists have sought to unravel the history of the nation-state, by using the history of anti-colonial federalist demands for equal incorporation into imperial states as evidence against a teleology of nationalist independence. In perceiving the democratic potentialities embedded within imperial state forms, revisionists argue that anti-colonial federalists therefore belong within a cosmopolitan tradition of seeking democratic supra-national governance beyond empire and nation. Some iterations of ‘post-colonial cosmopolitanism’ have unfortunately channelled debate into an opposition between federalism and nationalism, while also generating methodological republicanism, the tendency to view proto-republics within imperial formations. This review challenges these interpretive shortcomings and argues instead that federalism ought to be understood as part of a contest about the state as such. By integrating scholarship on French and British imperial federalism with recent work on regional federalisms in European and African contexts, this essay centres a whole range of ideological variations of ‘cosmopolitanism’ that adapted federalism to their critiques of the state. Ultimately, this reframing of federalist historiography enables new insights into contests about, and not just over, twentieth-century states.","[('MERVE FEJZULA', '')]","['10.3917/ving.083.0161', '10.1111/1467-6443.00039', '10.1353/imp.2018.0060', '10.1080/03086539808583029', '10.1215/1089201X-2773815', '10.2307/2078466', '10.1093/pastj/gtn015', '10.1080/09592296.2013.762881', '10.1515/9781400827978', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199588558.001.0001', '10.1215/1089201x-4133001', '10.1093/ehr/118.476.380', '10.1017/CBO9781139681001', '10.1525/9780520938618', '10.1080/13621020601099807', '10.1353/imp.2018.0059', '10.7208/chicago/9780226235226.001.0001', '10.1017/S0018246X18000407', '10.1017/S0960777303001462', '10.1525/9780520959903', '10.1017/CBO9780511614743', '10.1080/0140238042000283300', '10.1057/9781137028310', '10.7208/chicago/9780226773858.001.0001', '10.1353/esp.2007.0026', '10.1080/03086530500412132', '10.1515/9781400829767', '10.1017/S0018246X18000158', '10.1017/S1479244312000194', '10.1017/CBO9780511790645', '10.1017/S0021853708003915', '10.1017/S0080440117000123', '10.7312/moyn16048-008', '10.1017/S0165115300024578', '10.1515/9781400834709', '10.1215/9780822391982', '10.4159/9780674919808', '10.5040/9781350989108', '10.1017/CBO9781316418024.013', '10.1017/S0021853720000043', '10.1215/9780822375791', '10.1093/ahr/117.5.1461', '10.1177/0090591707310084', '10.1017/CBO9781139583732']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

But instead of narrating a story of abstracted governmentality, this paper dives below the waves, braiding Tamil poetry with scientific material relating to the oyster and state sources concerning fishery administration. Taken together, these unearth a multi-species history of the human relationship to the seas. In the same way that pearl divers’ labour was a mode of knowing nature, so too, natural processes and marine creatures shaped, in turn, the economic, social and cultural worlds at the fishery. This nacreous, layered approach combines natural history, maritime labour and historical ecology to explore the fragile and interlocking balance below the waves which extended beyond humans to the molluscs, sharks, boring sponges and parasitic tapeworms of the Gulf of Mannar. The archive around the pearl fishery advances the animal and ecological histories of the Indian Ocean and also points towards ways of suturing the gulf between Indian and Sri Lankan scholarship.","[('Tamara Fernando', 'Jesus College, Cambridge')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

However, their usefulness is hampered by their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Recently, many methods for measuring and improving a network’s robustness to adversarial perturbations have been proposed, and this growing body of research has given rise to numerous explicit or implicit notions of robustness. Connections between these notions are often subtle, and a systematic comparison between them is missing in the literature. In this paper we begin addressing this gap, by setting up general principles for the empirical analysis and evaluation of a network’s robustness as a mathematical property—during the network’s training phase, its verification, and after its deployment. We then apply these principles and conduct a case study that showcases the practical benefits of our general approach.","[('Marco Casadio', ''), ('Ekaterina Komendantskaya', ''), ('Matthew L.

Forest dynamics are closely related to climate change, natural disasters, and ecological diversity. The accumulated Landsat archive provides an unprecedented opportunity for long-term forest dynamics monitoring globally. However, using Landsat time series to detect small-scale and low-intensity disturbance events is still challenging since the moderate spatial resolution of Landsat images and the mixed pixel problem. Towards improving the ability of vegetation index (VI) in characterizing sub-pixel forest dynamics, this paper introduced the spectral mixture analysis (SMA) to develop a novel Pure Forest Index (PFI). The Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm was used to detect forest disturbance based on the PFI time series. Cross-comparison shows that PFI is far superior to other conventional VI in indicating forest conditions since it can enhance the spectral signal of the forest and suppress noises from the background. Time series analysis further demonstrates the superiority of PFI in accurately characterizing forest dynamics.

However, little is known regarding the impact of this shift on internships. Moreover, much of the available literature studies on internships are focused largely on perceptions by students, less so by supervisors. This paper describes the impact of COVID-19 on public health (PH) internships and examines interns' and supervisors' perspectives on their experiences in internships before and during the pandemic.Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional study design was conducted on two cohorts of undergraduate students and their supervisors in Singapore. Participants were surveyed using questionnaires with both close-ended and open-ended questions about various aspects of the internship experience. Data were triangulated from these surveys and module evaluation reports, and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively.FindingsCOVID-19 disrupted internships significantly, with a reduction in the number of placements offered and necessary changes to the internship scope. Overall, the internship experience has been positive. Supervisors and e-interns reported high levels of satisfaction and documented learning gains such as the development of technical skills and soft skills unique to remote work.Originality/valueThe study findings fill current gaps in the literature on supervisor perceptions and internship experiences during COVID-19. Recommendations are proposed to optimize e-internships, a potentially authentic workplace in the post-COVID era.","[('Cecilia Woon Chien Teng', ''), ('Raymond Boon Tar Lim', ''), ('Dana Wai Shin Chow', ''), ('Suganthi Narayanasamy', ''), ('Chee Hsiang Liow', ''), ('Jeannette Jen-Mai Lee', '')]","['10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30226-7', '10.1177/1529100615593273', '10.1016/j.jpubeco.2020.104271', '10.1300/J001v05n04_04', '10.1108/ET-10-2016-0157', '10.1191/1478088706qp063oa', '10.37074/jalt.2020.3.1.7', '10.1177/2373379916684850', '10.48009/3_iis_2020_11-19', '10.1108/00242531211267572', '10.1037/0021-9010.92.6.1524', '10.1108/IntR-11-2012-0226', '10.1007/978-3-319-90500-6_17', '10.1108/JWAM-09-2019-0028', '10.3389/fpubh.2020.00182', '10.1080/10963758.2020.1726769', '10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02509.x', '10.5173/ceju.2020.0087', '10.1186/s41239-017-0077-7', '10.19173/irrodl.v17i4.2385', '10.1044/2020_PERSP-20-00153', '10.1080/03075079.2016.1144181', '10.1111/j.1468-2958.2012.01428.x', '10.1007/s10671-012-9131-3', '10.1111/apps.12290', '10.1080/02678379408259982', '10.1037/0022-0167.26.1.64', '10.3109/0142159X.2012.643264']",Emerald

Although folding of unlithified or ‘soft’ sediments is typically assumed to produce similar geometries to those in ‘hard rocks’, there has to date been little detailed analysis of such folds. The aim of this paper is therefore to investigate folds developed during soft-sediment deformation (SSD) by applying techniques established for the analysis of tectonic folds during hard-rock deformation (HRD). We use the Late Pleistocene Lisan Formation exposed around the Dead Sea as our case study, as the laminated lake sediments record intricacies of fold detail generated during seismically triggered slumping of mass transport deposits (MTDs) towards the depocentre of the basin. While it is frequently assumed that folds created during SSD are chaotic and form disharmonic structures, we provide analyses that show harmonic fold trains may form during slumping, although larger upright folds cannot be traced for significant distances and are more typically disharmonic. Our analysis also reveals a range of fold styles, with more competent detrital-rich layers displaying buckles (Class 1B), as well as upright Class 1A folds marked by thickened limbs. Class 1A buckle folds are generally considered to be created by flattening that overprints folds with an original Class 1B geometry. As thickened fold limbs are truncated by overlying erosive surfaces, the vertical flattening is considered to have occurred during the slump event. Different fold shapes may partially reflect variable flattening, depending on the original orientation of upright or recumbent folds, together with continued downslope-directed simple-shear deformation that modifies the fold geometry. Analysis of fold wavelength, amplitude and bed thickness allows us to plot strain contour maps, and indicates that beds defining slump folds display viscosity contrasts in the range of 50–250, which are similar to values estimated from folds created during HRD in metamorphic rocks. A range of refold patterns, similar to those established by John Ramsay in metamorphic rocks, are observed within slumps, and are truncated by the overlying sediments, indicating that they formed during a single progressive slump event rather than distinct ‘episodes’ of superimposed deformation. This study confirms that techniques developed for the analysis of folds created during HRD are equally applicable to those formed during SSD, and that resulting folds are generally indistinguishable from one another. Extreme caution should therefore be exercised when interpreting the origin of folds in the rock record where the palaeogeographical and tectonic contexts become increasingly uncertain, thereby leading to potential misidentification of folds created during SSD.","[('G.

Civil War–era African Americans recognized the urgency of a core political concern: how best to use the opportunity presented by this conflict over slavery to win abolition and secure enduring black rights, goals that had eluded earlier generations of black veterans. Some, like Frederick Douglass, urged immediate enlistment to support the cause of emancipation, hoping that a Northern victory would bring about the end of slavery. But others counseled patience and negotiation, drawing on a historical memory of unfulfilled promises for black military service in previous American wars and encouraging black men to leverage their position to demand abolition and equal citizenship. In doing this, they also began redefining what it meant to be a black man who fights for the United States. These debates over African Americans’ enlistment expose a formative moment in the development of American citizenship: black Northerners’ key demand was that military service earn full American citizenship, a term that had no precise definition prior to the Fourteenth Amendment. In articulating this demand, Taylor argues, black Northerners participated in the remaking of American citizenship itself—unquestionably one of the war’s most important results.","[('Brian Taylor', '')]",[],University of North Carolina Press

We document four alternating phases of inequality decline and growth. The Black Death (1347–1352) led to inequality decline, until about 1450. Thereafter, inequality rose steadily. The Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) and the 1627–1629 plague triggered a second phase of inequality reduction. This distinguishes Germany from other European areas where inequality grew monotonically. Inequality growth resumed from about 1700, well before the Industrial Revolution. Our findings offer new material to current debates on the determinants of inequality change in western societies, past and present.","[('Guido Alfani', ''), ('Victoria Gierok', ''), ('Felix Schaff', '')]","['10.1007/s11698-016-0152-7', '10.1017/S1744137420000508', '10.1086/498123', '10.1257/jel.20201640', '10.1257/jep.29.1.67', '10.4159/9780674969797', '10.1017/S0018246X00025875', '10.3886/E144241V1', '10.1017/S0022050719000378', '10.1017/CBO9780511665141', '10.1016/j.eeh.2018.09.002', '10.1017/S0025727300067703', '10.1017/CBO9780511496943', '10.1515/9781400831883', '10.1524/9783050060514', '10.25162/9783515124454', '10.1017/S0022050717000092', '10.1017/CBO9780511497230', '10.1093/gerhis/ghaa012', '10.1515/9781400829828', '10.7788/boehlau.9783412319441.151', '10.1111/ehr.12071', '10.1111/ehr.12122', '10.1007/s11698-016-0154-5', '10.1007/s11698-016-0151-8', '10.1017/S0022050715001539', '10.1017/S0022050721000358', '10.7788/boehlau.9783412218287', '10.1515/9781400884605', '10.1515/jbwg-2019-0009', '10.1017/S0022050701025086', '10.1007/978-1-137-07738-7', '10.1111/ehr.12576', '10.1162/jinh.2010.40.4.513', '10.1057/9781137289773', '10.1515/9781400880348', '10.1016/j.eeh.2016.07.003', '10.1093/ereh/het013', '10.1093/ereh/hev018', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198706083.003.0006', '10.1515/9783110506761', '10.1257/jel.20191449', '10.2307/2598128', '10.1093/ereh/heaa026', '10.1111/ehr.12471', '10.1080/00324720903448712', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199276561.001.0001', '10.1016/j.eeh.2010.09.004', '10.4324/9781315149271-2', '10.4159/9780674369542']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Where a trace property defines a set of traces, a hyperproperty defines a set of sets of traces. The temporal logics HyperLTL and HyperCTL* have been proposed to express hyperproperties. However, their semantics aresynchronousin the sense that all traces proceed at the same speed and are evaluated at the same position. This precludes the use of these logics to analyze systems whose traces can proceed at different speeds and allow that different traces take stuttering steps independently. To solve this problem in this paper, we propose anasynchronousvariant of HyperLTL. On the negative side, we show that the model-checking problem for this variant is undecidable. On the positive side, we identify a decidable fragment which covers a rich set of formulas with practical applications. We also propose two model-checking algorithms that reduce our problem to the HyperLTL model-checking problem in the synchronous semantics.","[('Jan Baumeister', ''), ('Norine Coenen', ''), ('Borzoo Bonakdarpour', ''), ('Bernd Finkbeiner', ''), ('César Sánchez', '')]","['10.1016/0020-0190(85)90056-0', '10.1007/978-3-540-88313-5_22', '10.1145/512644.512660', '10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_33', '10.1007/978-3-030-03421-4_2', '10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_5', '10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_15', '10.3233/JCS-2009-0393', '10.1109/LICS.2019.8785713', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_7', '10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_3', '10.1109/SP.1982.10014', '10.1145/3434319', '10.1145/78969.78972', '10.1007/978-3-030-72016-2_6', '10.1145/567446.567463', '10.1007/978-1-4612-4222-2', '10.1007/978-3-030-39322-9_1', '10.1109/SFCS.1977.32', '10.1007/BFb0054170', '10.1090/S0002-9904-1946-08555-9', '10.1023/A:1011553200337', '10.1145/3358232']",Springer International Publishing
10.1093/pastj/gtab012,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,Vernacular Discourses Of Gender Equality In The Post-War British Working Class*,[],"Abstract Why did women’s roles change so dramatically in the West in the period after 1945? These years saw major changes in those roles, and in dominant understandings of female selfhood, from a model based on self-abnegation to one based on self-fulfilment. The roots of this shift have often been located in the post-1968 feminist movement and in economic change. Examining this question through the lens of Great Britain, this article, however, centres working-class women as drivers of these changes, drawing on oral history interviews with over 100 women from coalfield communities. In the decades after 1950, these women constructed a new vernacular discourse of gender equality which had profound implications for the position of women in society. This vernacular discourse shared some similarities with post-1968 feminism, but rather than focusing on the division of domestic and paid labour, or sexual violence, it emphasized women’s autonomy, individuality and voice. In constructing it, working-class women drew on pervasive post-war ideas about equality and democracy, discourses of individualism and individual fulfilment, and discourses of ‘companionate’ marriage and ‘child-centred’ parenting in order to make claims for women’s rights. Through doing so, they constructed women not only as wives and mothers, but also as free and equal individuals.","[('Florence Sutcliffe-Braithwaite', 'University College London'), ('Natalie Thomlinson', 'University of Reading')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Point cloud data of indoor scenes is primarily composed of planar-dominant elements. Automatic shape segmentation is thus valuable to avoid labour intensive labelling. This paper provides a fully unsupervised region growing segmentation approach for efficient clustering of massive 3D point clouds. Our contribution targets a low-level grouping beneficial to object-based classification. We argue that the use of relevant segments for object-based classification has the potential to perform better in terms of recognition accuracy, computing time and lowers the manual labelling time needed. However, fully unsupervised approaches are rare due to a lack of proper generalisation of user-defined parameters. We propose a self-learning heuristic process to define optimal parameters, and we validate our method on a large and richly annotated dataset (S3DIS) yielding 88.1% average F1-score for object-based classification. It permits to automatically segment indoor point clouds with no prior knowledge at commercially viable performance and is the foundation for efficient indoor 3D modelling in cluttered point clouds.","[('F.

Despite the basic perception of mining being unsustainable, there has been a radical shift in thinking about mining and sustainable development in recent decades, led by the introduction of numerous guidelines, schemes and protocols to address specific issues and improve reporting and accountability by mines and mining companies – in simple terms, using certification-type schemes to justify a sustainable or responsible approach to mining based on more ethical underpinnings. This chapter presents a unique and concise synthesis of these complex issues and outlines how mining can be described as responsible, sustainable or perhaps ethical even – or not as the case may be.","[('Gavin M.

Gendering Contraception in Family Planning Advice Literature in State-Socialist Poland (1950s-1980s),[],"Summary This article examines popular medical discourses on contraception produced in state-socialist Poland following the legalisation of abortion in 1956, a time when the party state declared family planning to be a public health project. By analysing popular medical literature, I argue that the popularisation of family planning constructed and relied on gender norms that could ease anxieties about the mainstreaming of ideas relating to sexuality and contraception, as well as about gender equality in a state-socialist context. I show that the femininity constructed in Polish birth control advice was based in fertility and the physical attractiveness required to maintain a husband’s sexual interest. Although masculinity was represented as distant, egoistic and violent, experts broadcast mixed messages about the effectiveness and usefulness of popular male contraceptive methods, some of which were at times utterly demonised.","[('Agata Ignaciuk', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

A sustainability viewpoint on psychological capital and life well-being of management graduates,[],"PurposeWell-being and employability are considered important indicators of a sustainable career that must be incorporated into the system at the beginning of a job. Hence, it is essential to explore the role of positive personal resources to improve young managers' well-being. The unending ambivalence in the academic environment and the job market is detrimental to management graduates' well-being. The study aims to look into the possible intervening methods to enhance the well-being of management students during difficult times.Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional study was conducted among 212 management students from Kerala, India. Multi-stage random sampling was used to collect data. Structural equation modelling using IBM-AMOS was done to gain insights into the proposed relationships.FindingsThe results indicated that psychological capital had a significant impact on the well-being of management students. Both perceived employability and psychological capital are positively related to life well-being. And, perceived employability mediated the relationship between psychological capital and life well-being.Research limitations/implicationsThe theoretical contribution comes from the application of the broaden-and-build theory and resource caravans from the conservation of resource theory as a theoretical framework to understand the positive impact of developing psychological capital among university students. The practical contribution comes from identifying a need for universities to make their campus climate more supportive of the non-academic needs of students by supporting them to become more self-reliant and enhance their positive psychological resources. Developing psychological resources of perceived employability and psychological capital is quintessential to enhance life well-being and career sustainability of early careers talent.Originality/valueThis study is one of the first attempts to discern how psychological capital leads to an accumulation of psychological resources and life well-being in university students and graduates offering opportunities for career sustainability.","[('Nimmi P.

Due to the over-approximation, the computed region in the abstraction may be spurious in the sense that it does not contain any true counterexample. Our goal is to identify such spurious regions and use them to guide the abstraction refinement. The core idea is to make use of the obtained constraints of the abstraction to infer new bounds for the neurons. This is achieved by linear programming techniques. With the new bounds, we iteratively apply DeepPoly, aiming to eliminate spurious regions. We have implemented our approach in a prototypical tool DeepSRGR. Experimental results show that a large amount of regions can be identified as spurious, and as a result, the precision of DeepPoly can be significantly improved. As a side contribution, we show that our approach can be applied to verify quantitative robustness properties.","[('Pengfei Yang', ''), ('Renjue Li', ''), ('Jianlin Li', ''), ('Cheng-Chao Huang', ''), ('Jingyi Wang', ''), ('Jun Sun', ''), ('Bai Xue', ''), ('Lijun Zhang', '')]","['10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_5', '10.1007/10722167_15', '10.1145/512950.512973', '10.1007/978-3-319-77935-5_9', '10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19', '10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_3', '10.1109/SP.2018.00058', '10.1007/978-3-642-02658-4_47', '10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_22', '10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1', '10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26', '10.1109/5.726791', '10.1007/978-3-030-32304-2_15', '10.1109/CVPR.2019.01168', '10.24963/ijcai.2018/368', '10.1007/s10916-014-0110-5', '10.1038/nature16961', '10.1145/3290354', '10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_2', '10.1007/978-3-030-30942-8_39', '10.1109/ICSE.2019.00126', '10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_22']",Springer International Publishing

The health assessment of strategic infrastructures and bridges represents a critical variable for planning appropriate maintenance operations. The high costs and complexity of traditional periodical monitoring with elevating platforms have driven the search for more efficient and flexible methods. Indeed, recent years have seen the growing diffusion and adoption of non-invasive approaches consisting in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for applications that range from visual inspection with optical sensors to LiDAR technologies for rapid mapping of the territory. This study defines two different methodologies for bridge inspection. A first approach involving the integration of traditional topographic and GNSS techniques with TLS and photogrammetry with cameras mounted on UAV was compared with a UAV-LiDAR method based on the use of a DJI Matrice 300 equipped with a LiDAR DJI Zenmuse L1 sensor for a manual flight and an automatic one. While the first workflow resulted in a centimetric accurate but time-consuming model, the UAV-LiDAR resulting point cloud’s georeferencing accuracy resulted to be less accurate in the case of the manual flight under the bridge for GNSS signal obstruction. However, a photogrammetric model reconstruction phase made with Ground Control Points and photos taken by the L1-embedded camera improved the overall accuracy of the workflow, that could be employed for flexible low-cost mapping of bridges when medium level accuracy (5–10 cm) is accepted. In conclusion, a solution for integrating interactively final 3D products in a Bridge Management System environment is presented.","[('F. Gaspari', ''), ('F. Ioli', ''), ('F. Barbieri', ''), ('E.

10.1111/hith.12163,HISTORY AND THEORY,0603 World History,"HOW THE VISUAL IS SPATIAL: CONTEMPORARY SPATIAL HISTORY, NEO-MARXISM, AND THE GHOST OF BRAUDEL",[],"ABSTRACTThis essay has two objectives. First, it seeks to engage critically with contemporary scholarship on the origins of racism through the lens of an older debate centered around the history of ideas. Specifically, it argues that Quentin Skinner's influential critique of the history of ideas can help identify the pitfalls of our current fascination with the origins of racism—most particularly when such origins are traced back to antiquity and the European pre‐ and early modern periods. In pursuing its second objective, the essay turns from histories cataloguing ancient, medieval, and early modern racisms to objections leveled, in these same literatures, against scholarship defending the modernity of race. The defense of a premodern origin to race is, I argue, not just a historical argument but a contemporary politics embedded in a narrative of continuity that insists on the relevance of the medieval past to the racial configurations of our current moment. Rather than demonstrating continuity and sameness, this essay seeks to draw attention to alternative modes of historicizing that are more attentive to the alterity of the past.","[('VANITA SETH', 'University of California, Santa Cruz')]",[],Wiley

U–Pb zircon ages reveal three stages of plutonism including: (i) sparse 3.2 Ga granodiorite plutons intruding the TTG (tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite) basement away from the western boundary of the Nagamangala greenstone belt; (ii) 3.0 Ga monzogranite to quartz monzonite plutons adjoining the Nagamangala greenstone belt; and (iii) 2.6 Ga monzogranite plutons in the Pandavpura region. Elemental data of the 3.2 Ga granodiorite indicate their origin through the melting of mafic protoliths without any significant residual garnet. Moderate to poorly fractionated REE patterns of 3.0 Ga plutons with negative Eu anomalies and Nd isotope data with ε Nd (T) = 3.0 Ga ranging from −1.7 to +0.5 indicate the involvement of a major crustal source with minor mantle input. Melts derived from those two components interacted through mixing and mingling processes. Poorly fractionated REE patterns with negative Eu anomalies of 2.6 Ga plutons suggest plagioclase in residue. The presence of magmatic epidote in all of the plutons points to their rapid emplacement and crystallization at about 5 kbars. The 3.2 Ga intrusions could correspond to reworking associated with a major juvenile crust-forming episode, whilst 3.0 Ga potassic granites correspond to cratonization linked to melting of the deep crust. The 2.6 Ga Pandavpura granite could represent lower-crustal melting and final cratonization, as 2.5 Ga plutons are absent in the WDC.","[('M.

Both pavilions – Germany's, in Albert Speer's neo-classical tower bloc crowned with a giant swastika, and the Soviet Union's, housed in Boris Iofan's forward-thrusting structure topped by Vera Mukhina's monumental sculptural group – represented the outcome of a large-scale collaboration between political leaders and architects, artists, intellectuals and graphic and industrial designers seeking to present their country to foreign visitors in a manner designed to advance the country's interests in the international arena.

This groundbreaking book explores two forms of critical geography: first, archipelagos of empire, examining how the Vietnam War is linked to the US military buildup in Guam and unwavering support of Israel, and second, corresponding archipelagos of trans-Indigenous resistance, tracing how Chamorro decolonization efforts and Palestinian liberation struggles are connected through the Vietnamese refugee figure.

We implement and evaluate this algorithm and related heuristics in the Z3 theorem prover. A crucial insight that underpins our algorithm is that real-world regex and string formulas contain a wealth of information about upper and lower bounds on lengths of strings, and such information can be used very effectively to simplify operations on automata representing regular expressions. Additionally, we present a number of novel general heuristics, such as the prefix/suffix method, that can be used to make a variety of regex solving algorithms more efficient in practice.

10.1111/hith.12209,HISTORY AND THEORY,0603 World History,3. LAW AND THE TIME OF ANGELS: INTERNATIONAL LAW'S METHOD WARS AND THE AFFECTIVE LIFE OF DISCIPLINES,[],"ABSTRACTRecent method wars in international legal scholarship turn on the problem of law in time. Rejecting historians' focus on context and their “policing of anachronism,” prominent legal scholars like Anne Orford and Martti Koskenniemi have argued that the workings of modern law are not governed by the narrow strictures of sequential chronology and that legal scholars require alternate methods that reflect law's transfer of meaning through time. Contextualism, in this reckoning, represents a misguided methodological straightjacket that stifles critique by quarantining meaning and power in discrete historical silos; the embrace of anachronism, conversely, would foster a revitalized history of international law intimately connected with the political imperatives of the present. This essay uses the debate as an opening into a fuller exploration of law in history and in time. In considering the idiosyncratic way law frames time, sequence, and duration, it explores the connection between law's transtemporal transfers and its very mode of reproduction. To speak of law's capacity to escape context and travel through time is another way of describing its normativity: the laws of the past that survive to exert a normative force in the present are not, in their law‐ness, past—they are simply present law. The essay suggests some ways to make that temporality itself the object of analysis (rather than naturalizing and affirming it, as Orford has, or, conversely, dismissing it as bad history, as some historians have). It draws on the history of science to generate an account of law's temporal habitus as a disciplinary knowledge tool, a kind of epistemic virtue that is intimately involved in law's internal criteria for truth and falsity.","[('NATASHA WHEATLEY', 'Princeton University')]",[],Wiley

Having insights into returning graduates' employability in their home country has become critical given that a majority of international graduates return home after their overseas study. This study responds to this critical need by examining how foreign credentials are valued by employers in the field of accounting in China, based on in-depth interviews with employers, alumni and policymakers.Design/methodology/approachThis study draws on a qualitative approach involving literature review and in-depth interviews with 28 key stakeholders: employers, returning graduates and policymakers in China and India. The key research question of the study is how foreign credentials are valued by employers in the field of accounting in China and India. This article focuses on the Chinese context. In-depth interviews with employers and policymakers focused on eliciting nuanced socio-cultural understandings as to perceptions and decisions associated with desirable graduate attributes and the relative value of credentials. Interviews with returning graduates aimed to understand how different capitals were mobilised to gain employment in the Chinese labour market.FindingsThe empirical findings of the study show that Chinese returning graduates could be seen to lack the localised knowledge needed to work in Chinese companies and ability to adapt to the local environment. However the possible development of a dual local and international guanxi through overseas study can be regarded as a marker of distinction in the home labour market. The associated value of such a dual guanxi signals the importance for Chinese international students to develop transnational networks while simultaneously maintaining their kinship, social and business networks locally during their overseas education.Originality/valueThe study provides fresh insights into a marked shift in China, with less of a preference for Western credentials, as compared to 10 years ago when overseas credentials were often regarded more favourably. Even though overseas study generally provides Chinese graduates with an exposure to international practices and global perspectives, whether such an overseas exposure and foreign language competency would be an advantage also depends on the business needs and sometimes the business model of organisations.","[('Ly Thi Tran', ''), ('Jill Blackmore', ''), ('Mark Rahimi', '')]","['10.1177/1028315309348736', '10.1080/17508487.2015.1117505', '10.1080/00224545.1980.9924253', '10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.521', '10.1177/0002764215580586', '10.1007/s12134-018-0576-y', '10.1080/1360080X.2012.689181', '10.1177/0117196815621806', '10.1007/978-3-319-78492-2_11', '10.2457/srs.43.61', '10.1016/j.ijintrel.2016.05.004', '10.1177/1028315310365541', '10.1177/0268580912453729', '10.1080/14747731.2011.622458', '10.1080/09639280902888229', '10.1080/01425692.2015.1044070', '10.1080/03057925.2020.1837613', '10.1080/14767724.2020.1789449', '10.1177/2455133315612310', '10.1080/13639080.2010.534774', '10.1080/14767724.2015.1026249', '10.1057/s41307-020-00185-y']",Emerald

For (finite-state) hardware, temporal hyperproperties are supported by model checking algorithms, and tools for general temporal logics like HyperLTL exist. For (infinite-state) software, the analysis of temporal hyperproperties has, so far, been limited tok-safety properties, i.e., properties that stipulate the absence of a bad interaction between anyktraces. In this paper, we present an automated method for the verification of$$\forall ^k\exists ^l$$∀k∃l-safety properties in infinite-state systems. A$$\forall ^k\exists ^l$$∀k∃l-safety property stipulates that for anyktraces, thereexistltraces such that the resulting$$k+l$$k+ltraces do not interact badly. This combination of universal and existential quantification enables us to express many properties beyondk-safety, including, for example, generalized non-interference or program refinement. Our method is based on a strategy-based instantiation of existential trace quantification combined with a program reduction, both in the context of a fixed predicate abstraction. Notably, our framework allows for mutual dependence of strategy and reduction.","[('Raven Beutner', ''), ('Bernd Finkbeiner', '')]","['10.1016/0304-3975(91)90224-P', '10.1109/LICS.2004.1319611', '10.1007/978-3-540-74407-8_6', '10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_42', '10.1007/11513988_29', '10.1007/978-3-642-35722-0_3', '10.1017/S0960129511000193', '10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_33', '10.1145/964001.964003', '10.1051/ita:2002013', '10.1145/3531130.3533369', '10.4230/LIPIcs.CONCUR.2021.24', '10.1109/CSF54842.2022.9919658', '10.48550/arXiv.2206.03381', '10.1145/2535838.2535860', '10.1109/LICS52264.2021.9470583', '10.1109/TSE.2004.22', '10.1145/2240236.2240262', '10.1145/3314221.3314596', '10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_15', '10.1109/CSF.2008.7', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_7', '10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_3', '10.1145/3324783', '10.1145/3158149', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_11', '10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_3', '10.1007/s13389-016-0141-6', '10.1007/3-540-63166-6_10', '10.1145/3434319', '10.1145/503272.503279', '10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_15', '10.1145/361227.361234', '10.1109/SECPRI.1988.8110', '10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24', '10.1145/75277.75293', '10.1007/978-3-319-94111-0_8', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_9', '10.1145/2908080.2908092', '10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_35', '10.1109/FMCAD.2014.6987617']",Springer International Publishing

Nation-Building in Russia After 1991,[],"AbstractRussia’s post-1991 nation-building project has been torn between competing interpretations of national identity. Whereas the other former Soviet republics opted for nation-building centered on the titular nation, Russia’s approach to national identity was framed by the fact that the RSFSR had been definednotas a designated national homeland but as a multi-ethnic federation. This, coupled with Russia’s definition as the legal successor of the Soviet Union, suggesting continuity and a history of uninterrupted statehood, has enabled a range of rivaling understandings of how to define the “nation.” Focusing on top-down official nation-building, this article examines how, against a backdrop of shifting political contexts, structural constraints, and popular attitudes, the Kremlin has gradually revised its understanding of what constitutes the “Russian nation.” Four models for post-Soviet Russian nation-building are identified – the ethnic, the multi-national, the civic, and the imperial. Over time, the correlation of forces among these has shifted. The article concludes that, despite some claims of an ethno-nationalist turn after 2014, the Kremlin still employs nationalism instrumentally: National identity has undoubtedly become morerusskii-centered, but, at the same time, the Kremlin keeps the definition of “Russianness” intentionally vague, blurring the boundaries between “nation” and “civilization.”","[('Helge Blakkisrud', '')]","['10.1080/08913819608443417', '10.1017/nps.2019.125', '10.1016/j.euras.2010.04.001', '10.1080/1060586X.2015.1076959', '10.4324/9780429426773', '10.1515/9781474433877-014', '10.1080/1060586X.1997.10641441', '10.2753/PPC1075-8216610202', '10.1080/01419870120112049', '10.2753/RUP1061-1940500503', '10.1017/CBO9780511598876', '10.1080/00905992.2014.917075', '10.1080/10758216.2015.1113884', '10.1017/nps.2020.40', '10.1080/09668136.2011.547693', '10.2753/RUP1061-1940470202', '10.1057/9780230101234', '10.1080/21599165.2014.956925', '10.4324/9780203465660', '10.1017/CBO9780511550348', '10.1080/01419870600665409', '10.2747/1060-586X.26.4.314', '10.4324/9781003045977', '10.1080/23761199.2016.1183396', '10.1080/10758216.2020.1752732', '10.1177/0010414002035005003', '10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700', '10.1017/CBO9780511558764', '10.1177/03058298990280031101', '10.4324/9781003045977-2', '10.3200/DEMO.18.2.101-121', '10.1017/slr.2018.290', '10.1080/10758216.2016.1225264', '10.1080/09668139808412578', '10.1080/1060586X.2018.1547040', '10.1111/russ.12107', '10.1017/nps.2020.83', '10.1017/nps.2020.8', '10.1057/9780230604216', '10.1080/21599165.2015.1035779', '10.1111/nana.12366', '10.7829/j.ctvh8r0nq', '10.1016/j.postcomstud.2009.10.008', '10.1515/9781474433877-016', '10.1080/09668136.2014.988999', '10.1080/00905990500088578', '10.1177/0967010695026001005']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)
10.1111/hic3.12619,HISTORY COMPASS,0603 World History,Making sense of the ruins: The historiography of deindustrialisation and its continued relevance in neoliberal times,[],"AbstractThe political upheavals of recent years, including Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, have increased scholarly and public interest in the impact of deindustrialisation on working‐class communities. Building upon earlier literature reviews, this historiographical study examines the continued flowering of this interdisciplinary, transnational field of research. After briefly recounting the emergence of the field in response to the structural transformations of the 1970s and 80s, and its subsequent ‘cultural turn’, this review focuses on identifying the most promising strands of contemporary English‐language research. It notes the particularly innovative attempts to identify the ‘moral economy’ of deindustrialising societies, the growing study of the long‐term cultural legacies or ‘half‐life’ of deindustrialisation, and the renewed focus on the politics of memory and heritage preservation. Finally, it considers how scholars can constructively respond to the increasing public interest in deindustrialisation, challenge racialised and exclusionary definitions of the working‐class, and unpick the historical relationship between deindustrialisation and the social and political transformations of recent times.","[('Christopher Lawson', 'University of California Berkeley')]","['10.1080/13619462.2017.1401476', '10.1080/000368498326100', '10.2307/j.ctv1850gh6', '10.1017/CBO9780511791109', '10.1111/1468-4446.12317', '10.1080/0023656X.2019.1681643', '10.17848/9780880994774.ch8', '10.17848/9780880994774.ch10', '10.1017/S0960777319000298', '10.1080/13619462.2020.1716732', '10.1080/00076791.2014.977875', '10.1177/1750698017741931', '10.17848/9780880994774.ch3', '10.1017/CBO9780511522178', '10.1080/09639489.2011.610164', '10.1093/hwj/dbu041', '10.7591/9781501723568', '10.1080/13602365.2013.804855', '10.1057/978-1-137-46297-8_4', '10.4324/9780203505113', '10.1080/13619462.2017.1408542', '10.1016/j.jhg.2017.11.004', '10.1353/jsh.2006.0079', '10.1093/wentk/9780190861414.001.0001', '10.1017/eso.2017.25', '10.1179/2051453013Z.0000000008', '10.7312/hack19372', '10.3138/9781442620902', '10.1017/S0147547913000276', '10.1111/hic3.12099', '10.3138/9781442686229', '10.1093/hwj/dbz003', '10.4324/9781315735962', '10.7591/9780801464058', '10.1093/oso/9780195045086.001.0001', '10.1017/S0963926816000730', '10.1057/9780230353916_1', '10.3998/mpub.8432351', '10.1057/9781137283146', '10.1093/jeg/lbu015', '10.1080/00343404.2015.1136410', '10.1002/9780470773727', '10.1007/978-1-137-34117-4', '10.59962/9780774834957-003', '10.3917/vin.144.0098', '10.7208/chicago/9780226560144.001.0001', '10.1111/1468-4446.12329', '10.7765/9781526124890', '10.1111/1468-4446.12365', '10.9783/9780812292893', '10.2307/134710', '10.7591/9781501724695', '10.1017/S0147547913000252', '10.1080/13619462.2011.597550', '10.1017/S0147547913000264', '10.1093/tcbh/hwu067', '10.1093/tcbh/hwz005', '10.4159/9780674369542', '10.4159/9780674245075', '10.1080/13562576.2013.817513', '10.1017/S0147547913000343', '10.1080/1369183X.2018.1480999', '10.1093/tcbh/hwx006', '10.1007/s10887-015-9122-3', '10.17848/9780880994774.ch6', '10.1093/oso/9780198836407.001.0001', '10.1515/9781400844173', '10.2307/j.ctv5cg8m6', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199931460.001.0001', '10.1080/13619462.2017.1408532', '10.1111/soc4.12143', '10.1093/past/50.1.76', '10.1111/j.1468-2281.2010.00544.x', '10.1093/tcbh/hwv030', '10.1017/9781139381611', '10.1080/01419870.2017.1361544', '10.1057/9780230359192', '10.1111/amet.12473', '10.1017/S0026749X00009410', '10.1525/9780520967205', '10.1504/IJMCP.2014.063847']",Wiley

The development of increasingly powerful Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is progressing continuously, so that these systems equipped with high-resolution sensors can be used for a variety of different applications. With the Matrice 300 RTK, Da-Jiang Innovations Science and Technology Co. Ltd (DJI) has launched a system that can use the high-resolution camera Zenmuse P1 or the laser scanner Zenmuse L1 as a recording sensor, among other sensors. In order to investigate the geometric quality of these two sensors, HafenCity University Hamburg, in cooperation with LGV Hamburg, NLWKN in Norden and the German Archaeological Institute in Bonn, flew over the 3D test field in the Inselpark in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg on 5 August 2021 with the P1 camera and the L1 laser scanner. Using the Matrice 300 RTK as carrier platform, the test field was recorded in various configurations at altitudes between 50 m and 90 m above ground. Prior to the UAV flight campaign, 44 marked ground control points (GCP) were signalised in the test field, which had already been surveyed by LGV in 2020 using geodetic measurement methods to achieve a coordinate accuracy of ±5 mm for each GCP. The results of aerial triangulations as well as 3D point clouds generated from image data and laser scanning are compared with reference data in order to demonstrate the accuracy potential of these measurement systems in this paper.","[('T.

How fiscally extractive were they? What was their capacity to provide public goods and services? And did this change in the “developmentalist” era of colonialism? To answer these questions, we use archival sources to build a new dataset on colonial states of the second French colonial empire (1830–1962). French colonial states extracted a substantial amount of revenue, but they were under-administered because public expenditure entailed high wage costs. These costs remained a strong constraint in the “developmentalist” era of colonialism, despite a dramatic increase in fiscal capacity and large overseas subsidies.","[('Denis Cogneau', ''), ('Yannick Dupraz', ''), ('Sandrine Mesplé-Somps', '')]","['10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199661527.001.0001', '10.1017/S002185371400036X', '10.1017/S0022050715000637', '10.3406/cea.1973.2710', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a097197', '10.3886/E133361V1', '10.3406/tiers.1962.1090', '10.1080/20780389.2016.1261630', '10.1017/CBO9780511800290', '10.4159/harvard.9780674074637', '10.2307/j.ctt6wr2vx', '10.1017/CBO9780511523861', '10.3406/remmm.1993.2570', '10.1111/j.1467-9957.1954.tb00021.x', '10.4000/civilisations.1717', '10.1093/0195139690.001.0001', '10.1111/roiw.12037', '10.5089/9781616357825.001', '10.1017/S1740022810000227', '10.1016/j.eeh.2010.10.002', '10.1257/app.1.2.176', '10.1017/CBO9780511584091', '10.1017/S0022050719000299', '10.4159/9780674369306', '10.1787/9789264104143-en', '10.1111/ehr.12820', '10.1017/S0020859017000177', '10.4159/9780674986213', '10.1017/9781108665001', '10.3917/droz.saul.2016.01', '10.1017/S0022050714000011', '10.1017/CBO9781139004237', '10.1017/S002205071500114X', '10.1016/S0305-750X(97)00010-7', '10.1017/S0022050718000049']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

As much of daily life migrates online, broadband—high-speed internet connectivity—has become a necessity. The widespread lack of broadband in rural America has created a stark urban–rural digital divide. In Farm Fresh Broadband, Christopher Ali analyzes the promise and the failure of national rural broadband policy in the United States and proposes a new national broadband plan. He examines how broadband policies are enacted and implemented, explores business models for broadband providers, surveys the technologies of rural broadband, and offers case studies of broadband use in the rural Midwest. Ali argues that rural broadband policy is both broken and incomplete: broken because it lacks coordinated federal leadership and incomplete because it fails to recognize the important roles of communities, cooperatives, and local providers in broadband access. For example, existing policies favor large telecommunication companies, crowding out smaller, nimbler providers. Lack of competition drives prices up—rural broadband can cost 37 percent more than urban broadband. The federal government subsidizes rural broadband by approximately $6 billion. Where does the money go? Ali proposes democratizing policy architecture for rural broadband, modeling it after the wiring of rural America for electricity and telephony. Subsidies should be equalized, not just going to big companies. The result would be a multistakeholder system, guided by thoughtful public policy and funded by public and private support.","[('Christopher Ali', '')]",[],The MIT Press

If Ukraine stops fighting, there will be no Ukraine’ is the sentiment used by Ukrainian protesters mobilising against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Such a sentiment signifies the stakes of a war where Ukraine is a democratic nation‐state fighting for its right to exist against a Russian invasion. Meanwhile, Russia is fighting for a version of Ukraine that is subservient to Russia's idea of what Ukraine should be as a nation‐state: under a Russian hegemon geopolitically, where Ukraine's national idea and interpretation of history can be vetted and vetoed by the Russian state. While nationalism scholarship equips us to study Russia's war against Ukraine through the lens of Russian ethnic nationalism and Ukrainian civic nationalism, the ethnic/civic dichotomy falls short of unpacking the more pernicious logics that pervade Russia's intentions and actions towards Ukraine (demilitarisation and de‐Nazification). Instead, this article explores the logics of Russia's war and Ukraine's resistance through the concept of existential nationalism where existential nationalism is Russia's motivation to pursue war, whatever the costs, and Ukraine's motivation to fight with everything it has.","[('Eleanor Knott', 'Department of Methodology LSE  London United Kingdom')]","['10.1080/09668136.2022.2032606', '10.1111/j.1354-5078.1999.00281.x', '10.1515/9780228013044', '10.1111/nana.12707', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00493.x', '10.1080/1060586x.2018.1451232', '10.1111/nana.12782', '10.1111/j.1354-5078.1998.00187.x', '10.1111/nana.12032', '10.1111/j.1354-5078.1995.00297.x', '10.1080/1060586x.2018.1452247', '10.1080/0966813032000161437', '10.1111/j.1354-5078.1998.00301.x']",Wiley

But there may be also good reasons to distinguish between them. This article considers in detail one important attempt in that direction by the classicist Moses Finley. It argues that there is considerable strength in that approach, putting the stress as it does on the distinctiveness of the settler community. It is also valuable in suggesting that early-modern Western colonialism marked a new departure in an older history of imperialism, thus once again suggesting the need for a conceptual separation of the two. But the article concludes that ultimately more may be lost than gained by insisting on the distinction. In particular, it inhibits wide-ranging comparisons between ancient and modern, and Western and non-Western, empires, which can often suggest illuminating connections and parallels. The field of empire studies gains by drawing on the rich store of examples provided by the whole history of empire, from the earliest times to now. Western colonialism is part of that story; to separate it out is to impoverish the field.","[('Krishan Kumar', '')]","['10.1525/9780520938618', '10.1080/14649373.2020.1720394', '10.1525/9780520918085', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199297276.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9781139047777', '10.1177/0725513617701919', '10.1093/actrade/9780199340491.001.0001', '10.4324/9781315544816', '10.1080/07075332.1998.9640824', '10.1515/9781400831661', '10.4159/9780674056206', '10.1086/201248', '10.2307/3679077', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2010.00448.x', '10.2307/2170830', '10.1177/002200946900400101', '10.1515/9781400827978', '10.2307/j.ctvc77c6d', '10.4159/9780674042025', '10.1007/s11186-009-9102-8', '10.1017/S0165115300007567', '10.1080/07075332.1998.9640829', '10.1080/10275720032000069601', '10.1215/00161071-25-2-295', '10.1080/03086539808583023', '10.1057/9780230299191', '10.1093/actrade/9780192802231.001.0001', '10.4159/9780674915909', '10.1080/14623520601056240', '10.1093/oso/9780199249077.001.0001', '10.2307/2505147', '10.1080/13642529.2018.1451077']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

The logic is higher-order, concurrent, with higher-order store and network sockets, and is fully mechanized in the Coq proof assistant.

Despite blatant electoral fraud and procedural violations, the official results declared Aleksandr Lukashenka reelected for a sixth term. While in the past, even the most obviously fraudulent election results have been followed by an atmosphere of resigned acceptance, this time countless Belarusians took to the streets to contest the results. What made this election different? This analysis of current affairs looks at the 2020 events through the lens of authoritarian consolidation theory, suggesting the unprecedented political mobilization was enabled by erosion in the three pillars of authoritarian stability: repression, cooptation, and legitimation. A majority of the population had been accepting the political status quo out of fear, for social and monetary security provided in exchange for loyalty, or a general understanding that there were no alternatives. Lukashenka did not realize this had largely changed. Nine months later, the foundation of the authoritarian regime is in an even worse shape. The regime’s reliance on repression further counteracts the legitimacy of the system. As a result, it seems it will be difficult for the authorities to re-consolidate authoritarianism, at least in the near future, no matter how the ‘revolution’ unfolds.","[('Sofie Bedford', '')]","['10.2139/ssrn.2571905', '10.1177/0888325415599826', '10.1080/17513057.2019.1677934', '10.1007/s10272-020-0913-1', '10.30965/20526512-00801005', '10.1080/13510347.2013.738860', '10.1080/09668136.2018.1555796', '10.1177/2336825X20984340', '10.1007/978-3-319-66523-8_3', '10.4324/9780203737910', '10.1017/CBO9780511804939.012', '10.1016/j.euras.2009.11.004', '10.15388/Polit.2012.4.1142', '10.1080/13510347.2013.738862', '10.1080/0966813032000130675', '10.7829/9789639776685Bekus', '10.23865/noros.v35.2653']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Conventional or learning-based 3D reconstruction methods from images have clearly shown their potential for 3D heritage documentation. Nevertheless, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) approaches are recently revolutionising the way a scene can be rendered or reconstructed in 3D from a set of oriented images. Therefore the paper wants to review some of the last NeRF methods applied to various cultural heritage datasets collected with smartphone videos, touristic approaches or reflex cameras. Firstly several NeRF methods are evaluated. It turned out that Instant-NGP and Nerfacto methods achieved the best outcomes, outperforming all other methods significantly. Successively qualitative and quantitative analyses are performed on various datasets, revealing the good performances of NeRF methods, in particular for areas with uniform texture or shining surfaces, as well as for small datasets of lost artefacts. This is for sure opening new frontiers for 3D documentation, visualization and communication purposes of digital heritage.","[('G. Mazzacca', ''), ('A. Karami', ''), ('S. Rigon', ''), ('E. M.

The usefulness of such estimations hinges on the accuracy of the underlying simulation model. Data-Driven Simulation (DDS) methods leverage process mining techniques to learn process simulation models from event logs. Empirical studies have shown that, while DDS models adequately capture the observed sequences of activities and their frequencies, they fail to accurately capture the temporal dynamics of real-life processes. In contrast, generative Deep Learning (DL) models are better able to capture such temporal dynamics. The drawback of DL models is that users cannot alter them for what-if analysis due to their black-box nature. This paper presents a hybrid approach to learn process simulation models from event logs wherein a (stochastic) process model is extracted via DDS techniques, and then combined with a DL model to generate timestamped event sequences. An experimental evaluation shows that the resulting hybrid simulation models match the temporal accuracy of pure DL models, while partially retaining the what-if analysis capability of DDS approaches.","[('Manuel Camargo', ''), ('Marlon Dumas', ''), ('Oscar González-Rojas', '')]","['10.1007/978-3-662-56509-4_10', '10.1007/978-3-642-45100-3_15', '10.1007/s12599-015-0410-4', '10.1016/j.dss.2020.113284', '10.1016/j.datak.2021.101897', '10.1007/978-3-319-59536-8_30', '10.1016/j.dss.2017.04.003', '10.1007/978-3-030-26619-6_19', '10.7717/peerj-cs.577', '10.1016/j.is.2021.101724', '10.1007/978-3-540-78238-4_8', '10.1016/j.is.2008.09.002', '10.1016/j.procs.2014.05.029', '10.1007/978-3-030-53337-3_19', '10.1038/nature14539', '10.1137/1.9781611975673.14', '10.1007/s10270-020-00789-3', '10.1007/978-3-030-58666-9_14', '10.1007/s10115-018-1214-x', '10.1016/j.is.2020.101561', '10.1007/978-3-642-32885-5_12', '10.1080/00031305.2017.1380080', '10.1109/TSC.2021.3139807', '10.1201/9781315162119', '10.1016/j.dss.2008.07.002', '10.1002/nav.3800020109']",Springer International Publishing

The analysis is based on a new data set of prices from almost 600 markets. Unlike previous research, we find that convergence was a predominantly pre-modern phenomenon. It started in the late fifteenth century, advanced rapidly until the beginning of the seventeenth century when it temporarily stalled, resumed after the Thirty Years’ War, and accelerated after the Napoleonic Wars in response to trade liberalization. From the late 1840s, convergence petered out and turned into divergence after 1875 as policy decisions dominated technological change. Our results point to the ‘Little Divergence’ between North-Western Europe and the rest of the continent as starting about 1600. Long-term improvements in market efficiency began in the early sixteenth century, with advances over time being as uneven as in price convergence. We trace this to differential institutional change and the non-synchronous spread of modern media and systems of information transmission that affected the ability of merchants to react to news.","[('Giovanni Federico', ''), ('Max-Stephan Schulze', ''), ('Oliver Volckart', '')]","['10.1111/ehr.12536', '10.1017/CBO9780511800610', '10.5479/sil.274320.39088000388900', '10.1093/ereh/her004', '10.2307/202442', '10.1515/9781400827817', '10.1515/9781400831883', '10.1162/003465302317411604', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00540.x', '10.2307/2598017', '10.1080/03585522.2018.1457979', '10.1016/j.eeh.2013.10.003', '10.1017/S0022050700019537', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608133.001.0001', '10.1007/978-3-030-00181-0_68', '10.1080/03585522.2014.949840', '10.3406/hism.1991.1386', '10.1017/9780511816215', '10.1093/ereh/hew013', '10.1163/ej.9789004178229.i-428', '10.1016/j.eeh.2010.12.003', '10.1017/S0022050700006641', '10.1017/CBO9780511496943', '10.1017/S1361491610000146', '10.1017/CBO9781139104234', '10.1017/CBO9780511496820', '10.1017/S0022050711001914', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00608.x', '10.4324/9780203423387', '10.1257/0022051042177649', '10.1016/j.eeh.2005.02.001', '10.1257/jep.29.4.227', '10.1016/S0014-2921(97)00129-3', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2007.00415.x', '10.1016/j.eeh.2004.10.001', '10.1017/S0022050702001055', '10.1002/jae.659', '10.1257/000282803769206278', '10.1017/CBO9781107707603', '10.1162/003355397555398', '10.1006/exeh.2001.0775', '10.4324/9780203183281', '10.1016/j.eeh.2009.04.005', '10.1111/1468-0262.00199', '10.1016/j.eeh.2012.09.002', '10.4324/9780203596890']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Facilitation by coaches, extensive documentation, knowledge sharing, empathy and an alignment to shared goals mitigate these challenges to some extent. Facilitation also enables the participants to experience the true benefits of technology aided collaboration.Research limitations/implicationsThe participants in the program had an average work experience of two years, and a senior management view was not represented.Practical implicationsThe learning from the program would help in designing more such collaborative and immersive learning experiences.Social implicationsPrograms about virtualization and automation of work processes enable an appreciation of the inherent challenges and shortcomings and a fairer implementation of technologies at the workplace.Originality/valueThe program brought into the classroom an immersive experience of the evolving dynamics between employers, digital technologies and employees of contemporary workplaces.","[('Mita Brahma', ''), ('Shiv S.

Contourites include depositional features (separated, sheeted, plastered and confined drifts), erosional features (abraded surfaces, channels, furrows and moats) and mixed features (contourite terraces). Drifts generally show high- to moderate-amplitude reflectors, which are cyclically intercalated with transparent layers. Transparent layers may represent finer-grained deposits, which can serve as seal rocks. High-amplitude reflectors (HARs) are likely to represent sandier layers, which could form hydrocarbon reservoirs. HARs occur on erosive features (moats and channels), and are clearly developed on contourite terraces and overflow features. Most of the contourite features described here are influenced by Mediterranean water masses throughout their Pliocene and Quaternary history. They specifically record Mediterranean Outflow Water, following its exit through the Gibraltar Strait. This work gives a detailed report on the variation of modern contourite deposits, which can help inform ancient contourite reservoir interpretation. Further research correlating 2D and 3D seismic anomalies with core and well-logging data is needed to develop better diagnostic criteria for contourites. This can help to clarify the role of contourites in petroleum systems.","[('Estefanía Llave', 'Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), Rios Rosas 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain'), ('F.

A number of approaches have been proposed for how to reverse formal models of concurrent computation including process calculi such as CCS, languages like Erlang, prime event structures and occurrence nets. However it has not been settled what properties a reversible system should enjoy, nor how the various properties that have been suggested, such as the parabolic lemma and the causal-consistency property, are related. We contribute to a solution to these issues by using a generic labelled transition system equipped with a relation capturing whether transitions are independent to explore the implications between these properties. In particular, we show how they are derivable from a set of axioms. Our intention is that when establishing properties of some formalism it will be easier to verify the axioms rather than proving properties such as the parabolic lemma directly.

It goes beyond the informal/formal binary, instead proposing the concepts of ‘para‐formality’ to describe economic activity that exists in parallel to regulated and taxed spheres, and ‘quasi‐formality’ to describe processes of formalisation that are supported by underlying informal practices. When unregulated, clasificadores enjoyed parallel services in health, finance and social security, implying that benefits of ‘formalisation’ must be explored ethnographically rather than assumed. The persistence of ‘quasi‐formal’ activity within formalised recycling plants complicates simple narratives of informal to formal transitions and suggests that the concept can be useful for the study of labour policies in Latin America and beyond.","[(""PATRICK O'HARE"", 'University of Manchester  UK')]","['10.1111/jlca.12220', '10.4337/9781849809290.00039', '10.2148/benv.37.1.30', '10.1017/S0022278X00008089', '10.1093/0199204764.003.0002', '10.1515/9780804793155', '10.1111/j.1470-9856.2011.00659.x', '10.1111/j.1548-1417.2012.01073.x', '10.1215/9780822372073', '10.1111/j.0309-1317.2004.00557.x', '10.1080/01436597.2013.800751', '10.1111/j.1470-9856.2008.00262.x', '10.1016/0305-750X(87)90038-6', '10.56021/9780801837357', '10.2307/2938384', '10.1177/0263775815600058', '10.1177/0734242X15600050', '10.1016/j.geoforum.2013.04.029', '10.1111/j.1467-8330.2010.00791.x', '10.7202/1014742ar']",Wiley
10.1017/S0960777320000089,CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN HISTORY,0603 World History,The Transnational Consensus: Fascism and Nazism in Current Research,[],"Transnational History emerged in the 1990s as a methodological perspective aiming to transcend the nation state as a prevalent unit of analysis. Akin to comparative history, transnational history focuses on transfers between countries and nations, cross-border exchanges and circulation of people and ideas, thus changing our understanding of modern historical phenomena and contributing to the development of global history. Today there is probably no modern historical subfield that has not heeded the new transnational insights. This review article argues that the history of fascism and national socialism have benefitted considerably from this epistemological advancement, and that this renewal has revolutionised our understanding of these ideologies, movements and regimes. Previously historians believed that fascism had emerged as a solution to the interwar crisis in different European nation states; ‘native’, ‘home-grown’ fascist movements, unique ultranationalist revolutionaries, spontaneously reacted to endogenous national problems and attempted a counterrevolution or national rebirth with different degrees of success. After the transnational turn, historians instead see fascism as a single transnational and global phenomenon that violently expanded throughout Europe and beyond by processes of transfer, mutual inspiration, hybridisation, interaction, entanglement and cross-border exchange.","[('Ángel Alcalde', '')]","['10.1080/13507486.2018.1439885', '10.3917/hp.026.0191', '10.1017/9781108565714', '10.1080/21567689.2018.1449109', '10.1086/687475', '10.1163/22116257-00201002', '10.1057/9781137299833.0003', '10.1093/oso/9780198834595.001.0001', '10.2307/j.ctv5cgbd6', '10.2307/j.ctvw04hnr.5', '10.1093/ahr/rhy571', '10.1017/9781108182423', '10.1163/22116257-00602001', '10.1007/978-1-137-35175-3']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

10.1093/ahr/rhz1226,AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,The Racialization of International Law after the Haitian Revolution: The Holy See and National Sovereignty,[],"Abstract The Haitian state shaped international definitions of sovereignty and national legitimacy after the Declaration of Independence in 1804. Haiti’s nineteenth century was not a period of isolation and decline; its first six decades were globally connected because the country’s leaders challenged their postcolonial inequality with diplomacy and state formation. This strategy aimed to establish Haiti’s membership in the “family of nations,” a central metaphor in European and American diplomatic, legal, and religious decision-making. In doing so, the Haitian state forced the Atlantic powers to redefine the boundaries of international relations. Haiti’s decades-long negotiations with the Catholic Church were tied to the racialization of the global hierarchy. After its Declaration of Independence, the Haitian state began clearing a theoretical path toward recognized sovereignty based on the dominant narrative that a society must be considered “civilized” on the world stage. But, as it cultivated internal policies and practices that rejected the dominant racist assumptions, these discriminatory ideologies became increasingly more explicit in international law.","[('Julia Gaffield', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Through a reflection on work in environmental history and associated disciplines, this paper presents a case for the strength and versatility of oral history as a key source for environmental history, while reflecting on questions of its reliability and scope. We identify three major insights provided by environmental oral history: into environmental knowledge, practices and power. We argue that, rather than being a weakness, the (inter)subjective and experiential dimensions of oral accounts provide a rich source for situating and interrogating environmental practices, meanings, and power relations. Oral history, moreover, provides a counterweight to a reliance on colonial archives and top-down environmental accounts, and can facilitate a renewal - and deepening - of the radical roots of environmental history. Furthermore, as a research practice, oral history is a promising means of expanding the participatory and grassroots engagement of environmental history. By decentring environmental expertise and eroding the boundaries (both fictive and real) of environmental knowledge production, oral environmental histories can provide key interventions in pursuit of a more just, sustainable world.","[('Brian Williams', 'Department of Geography Dartmouth College Hanover, NH 03755, USA'), ('Mark Riley', 'Department of Geography and Planning University of Liverpool Liverpool L69 3GP, UK')]",[],Liverpool University Press
10.1093/pastj/gtz020,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,SLAVE HOUNDS AND ABOLITION IN THE AMERICAS,[],"Abstract The lash and shackles remain two primary symbols of material degradation fixed in the historical memory of slavery in the Americas. Yet as recounted by states, abolitionists, travellers, and most importantly slaves themselves, perhaps the most terrifying and effective tool for disciplining black bodies and dominating their space was the dog. This article draws upon archival research and the published materials of former slaves, novelists, slave owners, abolitionists, Atlantic travelers, and police reports to link the systems of slave hunting in Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, and the US South throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Slave hounds were skillfully honed biopower predicated upon scenting, hearing, sighting, outrunning, outlasting, signaling, attacking, and sometimes terminating, black runaways. These animals permeated slave societies throughout the Americas and bolstered European ambitions for colonial expansion, indigenous extirpation, economic extraction, and social domination in slave societies. as dogs were bred to track and hunt enslaved runaways, slave communities utilized resources from the natural environment to obfuscate the animal's heightened senses, which produced successful escapes on multiple occasions. This insistence of slaves' humanity, and the intensity of dog attacks against black resistance in the Caribbean and US South, both served as proof of slavery's inhumanity to abolitionists. Examining racialized canine attacks also contextualizes representations of anti-blackness and interspecies ideas of race. An Atlantic network of breeding, training and sales facilitated the use of slave hounds in each major American slave society to subdue human property, actualize legal categories of subjugation, and build efficient economic and state regimes. This integral process is often overlooked in histories of slavery, the African Diaspora, and colonialism. By violently enforcing slavery’s regimes of racism and profit, exposing the humanity of the enslaved and depravity of enslavers, and enraging transnational abolitionists, hounds were central to the rise and fall of slavery in the Americas.","[('Tyler D Parry', 'University of Nevada, Las Vegas'), ('Charlton W Yingling', 'University of Louisville')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

It proved a source of constant frustration for Abraham Lincoln, and its commander, George B. McClellan, even secured the Democratic nomination for president in 1864. This book uses untapped sources to recast our understanding of soldier ideology and presents the most comprehensive view yet of the army’s political story. It recounts the struggle between Republicans and Democrats for political allegiance among the army’s rank and file, in the process showing that the army’s captains, majors, and colonels spurred a pro-Republican political awakening among the enlisted men that burst onto the public stage through newspaper editorials, unit resolutions, and letters to home front politicians. The book traces the heated campaigning and voting activity on the front lines during critical elections such as the 1864 presidential contest, highlighting how an army that had once revered McClellan renounced him for consorting with the forces of peace activism and treason. Union soldiers asserted themselves as the guardians of civic virtue and used the power of political organization to set the terms in a heated debate over wartime loyalty.","[('Zachery A.

10.1017/jbr.2019.243,JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES,0603 World History,"Rehabilitating an Empire: Humanitarian Collusion with the Colonial State during the Kenyan Emergency, ca. 1954-1960",[],"AbstractDuring the Kenyan Emergency of 1952–1960, one of the most violent episodes in the history of the British Empire, humanitarian organizations colluded with the colonial state to shore up British power. This article examines how aid agencies that claimed to exemplify the progressive internationalism of the postwar period participated in colonial violence. Far from condemning the brutality of the imprisonment and torture during the Kenyan Emergency, aid organizations were deeply implicated in parallel projects for women and children that sought to achieve the same objectives: the remaking of Kikuyu hearts and minds and the weakening of anticolonial resistance. Far from acting as a check on colonial violence in an era of burgeoning rights discourses in 1950s Kenya, self-proclaimed “impartial” internationalist organizations, while claiming to uphold values of universal humanity, worked as auxiliaries to the colonial counterinsurgency. Taking their cue from military counterinsurgency in 1950s Malaya, humanitarians sought to win “hearts and minds” and undertook material provision for imprisoned anticolonial activists and their families on behalf of the colonial state. They did so by importing new humanitarian expertise developed in wartime Europe and adapting it to fit within racist, colonial norms. In providing this allegedly impartial expertise, humanitarian organizations lent credence to the myth that rehabilitation in Kenya was a progressive program enacted by a liberal empire to modernize its subjects, rather than a ruthless attempt to stymie anticolonial resistance by any means necessary. In this case, postwar humanitarian internationalism did not challenge colonial brutality but enabled it.","[('Emily Baughan', '')]","['10.1017/S1816383115000636', '10.1093/pastj/gtq053', '10.2307/219387', '10.1525/9780520936645', '10.2307/j.ctv29g2hs5', '10.1017/CBO9781139547314', '10.1017/S0021853700031157', '10.1515/9781400831661', '10.1017/CBO9780511585517', '10.1111/j.1468-2281.2012.00608.x', '10.2307/j.ctv224tw99.13', '10.1007/978-1-349-19547-3', '10.1017/S0021853705001660', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199570485.001.0001', '10.1525/9780520928251', '10.1093/pastj/gtw042', '10.1093/hwj/dbx035', '10.1017/S0018246X01002163', '10.1080/14788810.2014.959836', '10.4159/9780674089150', '10.4159/9780674425507-006', '10.1177/0021909608089258', '10.2307/219979', '10.2307/523724', '10.3917/mond.142.0045', '10.1093/pastj/gtx059', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199674169.001.0001', '10.1086/495100', '10.1017/jbr.2016.57']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Despite advances in technology, their powerful nature often damages expensive instruments placed in their path. These challenges mean that turbidity currents have only been measured in a few locations worldwide, in relatively shallow water depths (&lt;&lt;2 km). Here, we share lessons from recent field deployments about how to design the platforms on which instruments are deployed. First, we show how monitoring platforms have been affected by turbidity currents including instability, displacement, tumbling and damage. Second, we relate these issues to specifics of the platform design, such as exposure of large surface area instruments within a flow and inadequate anchoring or seafloor support. Third, we provide recommended modifications to improve design by simplifying mooring configurations, minimizing surface area and enhancing seafloor stability. Finally, we highlight novel multi-point moorings that avoid interaction between the instruments and the flow, and flow-resilient seafloor platforms with innovative engineering design features, such as feet and ballast that can be ejected. Our experience will provide guidance for future deployments, so that more detailed insights can be provided into turbidity current behaviour, in a wider range of settings.","[('Michael Clare', 'National Oceanography Centre, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, UK'), ('D.

However, this literature has tended to focus on specific regions, and has often sidestepped the larger question of how to conceptualise the relationship between print media and colonial rule. While some have used the term ‘colonial public sphere’ or ‘colonial publics,’ others have preferred to avoid these terms and instead thought in terms of multiple and overlapping publics. What this literature has shown is that a single analytic model for analysing public spaces of discourse is not usable. In this Introduction to our Special Issue we propose a new framework for studying the publics created through print media in the colonial world. We outline a set of four factors – addressivity, performativity, materiality and periodicity – that can be applied to specific historical case studies. We then explain how the issue as a whole models this methodology as a means to analyse how print media (as one medium within the public sphere) functioned in specific colonial and semi-colonial spaces around the world.","[('Emma Hunter', ''), ('Leslie James', '')]","['10.1093/ahr/123.3.846', '10.1353/book5205', '10.1057/9780230623248', '10.1163/9789004229969', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199265121.001.0001', '10.1215/9780822389996', '10.1080/1013929X.2006.9678252', '10.1515/9780822375241', '10.1177/0263276407080093', '10.1086/244442', '10.1080/03071021003795055', '10.1177/0263276407080090', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199568963.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9780511619656', '10.1080/02560054.2011.621298', '10.1017/CBO9781316563007', '10.1093/ahr/118.2.401', '10.1017/S0010417518000191', '10.2307/465279', '10.1215/08992363-14-1-49', '10.4159/harvard.9780674074743', '10.1057/9780230205147']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Originally, it was developed in the context of geosciences to increase the awareness of geoscientists to their cultural and social role, but over time expanded to define a way in which humans can rethink their relationship with the Earth system in the light of principles and values that can provide a healthy and safe life in respect for geo-ecosystems. The theoretical framework of geoethics has now consolidated, and it has become the proposal on which to base a global ethics for the new millennium. This chapter outlines the scientific and cultural reference framework in which geoethics developed; the theoretical foundations of geoethics and its main characteristics; global anthropogenic issues under a geoethical perspective; ethical and social aspects related to two potential human activities respectively to combat global warming (geoengineering); and to provide for the growing demand for georesources (deep-sea/ocean mining). The authors highlight the importance of sharing values and actions among planetary human communities to manage global changes and threats. One wonders if the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can suggest or confirm reflections on geoethical thinking. Finally, a charter for a responsible course of human development, articulated in nine principles and actions, is proposed.","[('Silvia Peppoloni', 'Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Rome, Italy'), ('Silvia Peppoloni', 'IAPG – International Association for Promoting Geoethics'), ('Giuseppe Di Capua', 'Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Rome, Italy'), ('Giuseppe Di Capua', 'IAPG – International Association for Promoting Geoethics')]","['10.1130/SPE501', '10.1080/09644010701211650', '10.1002/9781119067825.ch11', '10.1144/SP508-2019-213', '10.1007/978-3-030-12010-8_1', '10.1126/sciadv.1400253', '10.1073/pnas.1704949114', '10.1029/2019EO121687', '10.1007/3-540-26590-2_3', '10.1007/s10584-006-9101-y', '10.2190/1GU8-EQN8-02J6-2RXK', '10.5751/ES-11236-240416', '10.4401/ag-7553', '10.1029/2009EO490006', '10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107<0960:GRGAAI>2.3.CO;2', '10.1007/978-3-319-43766-8', '10.1007/s11948-005-0006-3', '10.5040/9781474236607', '10.2138/gselements.14.5.325', '10.1146/annurev.energy.25.1.245', '10.1007/s10584-006-9132-4', '10.2307/3857310', '10.1017/S0892679416000058', '10.1021/acs.est.9b02808', '10.1016/S0195-9255(98)00041-9', '10.2307/j.ctv2c3k261', '10.2138/gselements.14.5.301', '10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.017', '10.1111/j.1468-5930.1993.tb00078.x', '10.1144/SP508-2020-66', '10.1038/s43017-020-0024-3', '10.1002/9781119067825.ch13', '10.1353/book27397', '10.1080/13569775.2018.1452107', '10.1126/science.1103618', '10.1126/science.1172133', '10.1016/j.resourpol.2012.06.016', '10.1016/B978-0-12-799935-7.00001-0', '10.1130/2016.2520(03)', '10.1007/978-3-030-12010-8_2', '10.5751/ES-10558-230446', '10.1002/wcc.198', '10.1093/biosci/biz088', '10.1038/461472a', '10.2138/gselements.14.5.291', '10.1146/annurev-earth-050212-123944', '10.1007/978-3-319-73250-3_6', '10.3390/su10113836', '10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[614:TAAHNO]2.0.CO;2', '10.1007/s13280-011-0185-x', '10.1177/2053019614564785', '10.1126/science.1259855', '10.2138/gselements.14.5.298', '10.1007/978-3-642-23571-9', '10.1130/GSAT01802A.1', '10.3390/min7110203']",Geological Society of London

It finds while the concept of gastronationalismper sehas not been rigorously developed, scholarship of food and nationalism in general has been developing fast. A major development in the study of gastronationalism is the introduction of the everyday nationhood/banal nationalism perspective, which in turn diverts the focus away from the state’s intervention, a point emphasized by Michaela DeSoucey. The review of the field suggests that a renewed focus on the role of food in the interaction between state actors and international organizations would further refine the concept of gastronationalism. As for the study of food and nationalism, efforts to integrate findings from existing case studies to produce an overall understanding of society are needed.","[('Atsuko Ichijo', '')]","['10.1080/08941920.2017.1422062', '10.1177/0003122410372226', '10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7_13', '10.1215/00182168-2009-091', '10.25222/larr.75', '10.1177/1468796808088925', '10.1525/9780520965522', '10.1080/00856401.2013.833071', '10.25024/kj.2010.50.1.11', '10.1017/S0026749X11000850', '10.1080/14631369.2014.939332', '10.1017/S0010417500015024', '10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7_15', '10.1111/sena.12219', '10.1080/00905992.2018.1473353', '10.1080/14747731.2016.1150570', '10.1111/j.1944-8287.2005.tb00264.x', '10.5840/cultura201512117', '10.1057/9781137483133', '10.5040/9781350074163', '10.1080/07409710.2011.599778', '10.1177/1367549418786404', '10.1111/j.1468-0467.2010.00354.x', '10.1017/S0026749X09990072', '10.1080/10350330903566004', '10.1016/j.jrurstud.2013.08.001']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)
10.1017/S0963926819000221,URBAN HISTORY,0603 World History,De-industrialization: strengths and weaknesses as a key concept for understanding post-war British history,[],"AbstractThis article argues for a central role for the concept of de-industrialization in understanding the evolution of the economies of urban Britain in the years since 1945. Above all, it is suggested, this concept is crucial because it focuses attention on the consequences of the transition from an industrial to a service-dominated labour market. To make this argument requires a careful definition of the term, along with recognition of its potential weaknesses as well as strengths. Key issues are highlighted by drawing on three diverse urban areas, which help to show the ubiquity of the process, but also its diverse patterns, chronologies and impacts. These examples are a stereotypical ‘post-industrial city’ (Dundee); a major city where de-industrialization has played an under-regarded role in developments (London); and a medium-size town in the south of England (High Wycombe), where the decline of a core industry (furniture) was crucial to its recent history. The final sections analyse the relationship between de-industrialization and other key frameworks commonly deployed to shape understanding of the recent history of Britain: ‘decline’, ‘globalization’ and ‘the triumph of neo-liberalism’.","[('Jim Tomlinson', '')]","['10.1111/hic3.12099', '10.1017/S0963926813000448', '10.1179/174581808X324289', '10.1111/1467-9485.00104', '10.1093/tcbh/hwi053', '10.1093/tcbh/hwp019', '10.1080/00420989550012708', '10.1093/tcbh/hwv030', '10.1016/j.cities.2007.01.007', '10.2307/622738', '10.1017/CBO9780511521935', '10.1017/CBO9780511550027', '10.3366/scot.1995.0025', '10.1017/CHO9781139815024.013', '10.1111/j.1467-9485.1986.tb00272.x', '10.1017/S0963926816000730', '10.3366/edinburgh/9780748686148.003.0003', '10.1016/j.eeh.2011.06.004', '10.4159/9780674054264', '10.1093/tcbh/hwt005', '10.1017/S0147547913000264', '10.1007/978-1-349-18501-6', '10.1080/13563460903553723', '10.1080/13545700701716680', '10.2307/621814', '10.1080/00420986520080021', '10.4324/9780203414941', '10.1177/002795010017200107', '10.1080/13619462.2012.673714', '10.1007/s10887-015-9122-3', '10.1017/S1361491602000187', '10.1162/rest.89.1.118', '10.1093/oso/9780198786092.001.0001', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199589081.001.0001', '10.1007/978-0-230-39255-7', '10.1007/978-94-017-5586-3', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190676681.001.0001', '10.1093/oxrep/15.4.35', '10.3366/scot.2016.0137', '10.1017/S0020859002000767']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

In this scheme, six first-order megasequence boundaries have been defined, characterized by extensive and long-lasting erosional hiatuses and major coastal regressions: (1) Caledonian (or Base Devonian) Unconformity; (2) Variscan–Saalian (or Base Permian) Unconformity; (3) Mid Cimmerian (or Intra-Aalenian) Unconformity; (4) Late Cimmerian (or Base Cretaceous) Unconformity; (5) Atlantean (or Near-Base Tertiary) Unconformity; and (6) Eridanos (or Mid-Miocene) Unconformity. These surfaces have been linked to regional causal factors ranging from orogenesis-related compressional uplifts, in either active plate margin settings (1) or foreland basin settings (2), to intra-plate dynamically supported uplifts associated with the development of mantle plumes (3, 5 and 6) and the end-of-rifting and associated widespread erosion of tilted fault block crests (4). The aforementioned megasequence boundaries punctuate the geodynamic evolution of the North Sea area and facilitate the subdivision of the entire the North Sea sedimentary basin fill into six megasequences, named here A–F. All of the lithostratigraphic units of the North Sea (formations and members) have been described within the context of this first-order tectono-stratigraphic framework. The correlation powers of certain stratigraphic markers are also compared and contrasted, together with the potential cross-border equivalence of sedimentary units on different sides of the political median lines.","[('Stefano Patruno', 'Department of Engineering, University of Nicosia, 46 Makedonitissas Avenue, CY-2417, PO Box 24005, CY-1700, Nicosia, Cyprus'), ('Henk Kombrink', 'North Sea Core, 8 Dubford Terrace, Aberdeen AB23 8GE, UK'), ('Stuart G.

Saving energy is important for our living environment and to save cost in data centers. Yet, researchers compare the efficiency of algorithms still in terms of consumption of CPU time (or even wall time). Perhaps one reason for this is that measuring energy consumption of computational processes is not as convenient as measuring the consumed time and there is no sufficient tool support. To close this gap, we contribute CPU Energy Meter, a small tool that takes care of reading the energy values that Intel CPUs track inside the chip. In order to make energy measurements as easy as possible, we integrated CPU Energy Meter into BenchExec, a benchmarking tool that is already used by many researchers and competitions in the domain of formal methods. As evidence for usefulness, we explored the energy consumption of some state-of-the-art verifiers and report some interesting insights, for example, that energy consumption is not necessarily correlated with CPU time.","[('Dirk Beyer', ''), ('Philipp Wendler', '')]","['10.1007/s00450-010-0119-z', '10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_55', '10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_9', '10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y', '10.5281/zenodo.3679337', '10.1145/2989081.2989088', '10.1109/CGC.2012.113', '10.1109/TPDS.2009.76', '10.1109/ISPASS.2013.6557170', '10.1109/IPDPSW.2015.70', '10.1145/2425248.2425252', '10.7287/peerj.preprints.1470v2', '10.1109/IGCC.2015.7393710', '10.1007/s00450-016-0325-4', '10.1007/s00450-016-0327-2', '10.1109/IPDPSW.2013.243', '10.1109/ICPPW.2012.39']",Springer International Publishing

To do so, it employs the Foucauldian perspective on racism, understood as deployed in defence of one's own nation, which is imagined as ""race"". The article also contextualises this discourse by elaborating how three globally circulated racist themes (threat, unworthiness and otherness) are deployed to uphold three components of hegemonic Polish national self‐definition (vulnerability, deservingness and ‘Westernness’) against three aspects of the perceived liminality that destabilise this self‐definition (temporal, moral and spatial). The article concludes that in Poland, the ‘anti‐immigration’ discourse deploys racism as a device symbolically to ‘protect’ the imagined ethnically, religiously and culturally homogenous Polish nation from the belittlement and dilution of collective self‐definition under the conditions of globalisation.","[('Kinga Polynczuk‐Alenius', 'Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies University of Helsinki Helsinki Finland')]","['10.7765/9781526126610', '10.1080/01419870.2017.1392028', '10.1080/00313220903109235', '10.1080/01419870.1996.9993918', '10.1016/j.postcomstud.2009.10.006', '10.1080/01419870802208388', '10.1080/14791420.2014.977309', '10.1080/01419870902999233', '10.56583/fs.171', '10.1080/1070289X.2014.950974', '10.2307/2501049', '10.1111/amet.12259', '10.1177/0959354301114006', '10.2307/2492615', '10.14321/j.ctvj7wpdx.9', '10.4135/9780857020239', '10.14324/111.0954-6839.059', '10.30674/scripta.70069', '10.1177/0038038518757952', '10.1080/15562948.2017.1317897', '10.1191/0309132504ph498oa', '10.1007/978-3-319-78990-3_5', '10.4324/9780203871898', '10.1111/j.1354-5078.1995.00163.x', '10.1007/s10767-018-9287-9', '10.1177/0888325413502222', '10.2307/j.ctt1djmgbf.20', '10.1093/oso/9780195131468.001.0001', '10.4324/9781315712741', '10.1080/1369183X.2018.1451308', '10.1177/0888325416658950', '10.1177/0888325412448473', '10.1215/08992363-2010-018', '10.1111/j.1747-9991.2011.00443.x', '10.1075/ct.7.15dij', '10.1177/0888325400014001002', '10.1215/9780822399018', '10.7208/chicago/9780226993058.001.0001']",Wiley
10.1093/pastj/gtz069,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,A DIFFERENT STORY IN THE ANTHROPOCENE: BRAZIL'S POST-COLONIAL QUEST FOR OIL (1930-1975),[],"Abstract This article aims to identify new historical causes for the making of the Anthropocene (the rise of humans to a geological force) by addressing Brazil’s transformation into an oil producer and an oil-dependent country between 1930 and 1975. This example allows an escape from the essentialist explanation of the Anthropocene as the result of humans’ insatiable appetite for consumption, commonly rooted in an analysis of Western industrial society, and to focus instead on the notion of freedom in a former colony. Indeed, in the context of nation-building and modernization debates, petroleum appeared to many Brazilians as an opportunity to emancipate the country from its peripheral role as global raw material provider. The rise of petroleum gave a post-colonial sense to the nation-founding myth of Brazil’s exceptional nature, which served as romantic background for a movement towards resource sovereignty embedded into a global anti-imperialist context. In Brazil specifically, oil production became an opportunity for a process of ecological transformation that promised to rid the country of colonial landscapes of exploitation, and even appeared as a solution for stopping the unsustainable destruction of tropical forests. Ultimately, these petro-ideals of emancipation, by positively linking nature and the nation, also hindered fully detecting the scope of the pollution problems that oil was generating. As argued in the article’s conclusion, this example should rekindle the discussion about the unintended link between freedom and geological change in the analysis of Anthropocene causalities.","[('Antoine Acker', 'University of Zurich')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

During this time interval, the margin evolved from an active margin ( c. 750–500 Ma: the Reguibat–Avalonian–Cadomian arc) to the final collision with Laurussia in Devonian times to form Pangaea. In this context, one of the oldest recognized ophiolites is the Bou Azzer Ophiolite from the Anti-Atlas Mountains, dated at c. 697 Ma and containing two types of mafic rocks, the youngest of which has a boninitic composition. To the north, in the SW Iberian Massif, the Calzadilla Ophiolite contains mafic rocks also of boninitic composition dated at c. 598 Ma. Farther north, in the NW Iberian Massif, the Vila de Cruces Ophiolite is formed by a thick sequence of mafic rocks with an arc tholeiitic composition and minor alternations of tonalitic orthogneisses dated at c. 497 Ma. In the same region, the Bazar Ophiolite has a similar age of c. 495 Ma. Also in NW Iberia, there is a group of ophiolites with varied lithologies and dominant mafic rocks with arc tholeiitic composition (Careón, Purrido and Moeche ophiolites) dated at c. 395 Ma. The composition of all these peri-Gondwanan ophiolites is of supra-subduction zone type, showing no evidence of preserved mid-ocean ridge basalt type oceanic lithosphere. Consequently, these ophiolites were generated in the peri-Gondwanan realm during the opening of forearc or back-arc basins. Forearc oceanic lithosphere was promptly obducted or accreted to the volcanic arc, but the oceanic or transitional lithosphere generated in back-arc settings was preserved until the assembly of Pangaea. Based on the ages of the described ophiolites, the peri-Gondwanan realm has been a domain where the generation of oceanic or transitional lithosphere seems to have occurred at intervals of c. 100 myr. These regularly spaced time intervals may indicate cyclic events of mantle upwelling in the peri-Gondwanan mid-ocean ridges, with associated higher subduction rates at the peri-Gondwanan trenches and concomitant higher rates of partial melting in the mantle wedges involved. The origin of the apparent cyclicity for mantle upwelling in the peri-Gondwanan ocean ridges is unclear, but it could have possibly been related to episodic deep mantle convection. Cycles of more active deep mantle convection can explain episodic mantle upwelling, the transition from low- to fast-spreading type mid-ocean ridges and, finally, the dynamic context for the episodic generation of new supra-subduction zone type oceanic peri-Gondwanan lithosphere.","[('Ricardo Arenas', 'Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología and Instituto de Geociencias (UCM, CSIC), Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain'), ('Sonia Sánchez Martínez', 'Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología and Instituto de Geociencias (UCM, CSIC), Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain'), ('Richard Albert', 'Institut für Geowissenschaften, Goethe-University Frankfurt, 60438 Frankfurt, Germany'), ('Faouziya Haissen', 'LGAGE, Département de Géologie, Université Hassan-II de Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco'), ('Javier Fernández-Suárez', 'Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología and Instituto de Geociencias (UCM, CSIC), Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain'), ('Núria Pujol-Solà', 'Departament de Mineralogia, Petrologia i Geologia Aplicada, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain'), ('Pilar Andonaegui', 'Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología and Instituto de Geociencias (UCM, CSIC), Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain'), ('Rubén Díez Fernández', 'Departamento de Geodinámica, Estratigrafía y Paleontología, Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain'), ('Joaquín A.

Presenting the case studies of Fannie Fern Andrews, Mary Parker Follett and Florence Wilson, it shows that, in emerging professional and disciplinary contexts that have hitherto lain beyond the purview of historians of international thought, these women developed their thinking about the international. The insights they derived from their practical work in schools, immigrant communities and libraries led them to emphasize the mechanics of participation in international affairs and caused them to think across the scales of the individual, the local group and relations between nations. By moving beyond the history of organizations and networks and instead looking for the professional settings and audiences which enabled women to theorize, this article shifts both established understandings of what counts as international thought and traditional conceptions of who counts as an international thinker.","[('Valeska Huber', ''), ('Tamson Pietsch', ''), ('Katharina Rietzler', '')]","['10.1086/644347', '10.1080/17400201.2012.711755', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199577934.001.0001', '10.2307/1280162', '10.4324/9781315772394', '10.1080/14616742.2011.534660', '10.2307/369936', '10.1111/1467-856X.00053', '10.2307/j.ctt1j7x6pk', '10.1080/09612020802608140', '10.1057/9780230204300_11', '10.1086/603439', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199570485.003.0010', '10.12987/yale/9780300096217.001.0001', '10.23943/princeton/9780691121840.001.0001', '10.1177/000271622109600120', '10.1515/9781400836635', '10.1111/1600-0498.12018', '10.4324/9781315259031', '10.2307/2143093', '10.1080/00309230.2010.530278', '10.1017/heq.2017.30', '10.1093/ahr/123.2.393', '10.1353/jowh.2003.0058', '10.1177/000271621606600104', '10.1111/0149-0508.00141', '10.1017/CBO9781316286838', '10.1080/00309230.2012.678869', '10.1093/hwj/dbn025', '10.1057/9780230370210_8', '10.1007/978-3-319-65575-8', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190495954.001.0001', '10.1111/0020-8833.00091', '10.2307/j.ctt13x0h4w', '10.1353/jowh.2005.0025', '10.1179/1758348914Z.00000000068', '10.1057/9781137303523', '10.1353/jowh.2011.0013', '10.1111/j.1571-9979.1989.tb00519.x', '10.2307/1947133', '10.1007/978-3-319-77568-5', '10.5040/9780755625673', '10.1515/9781503623873', '10.1080/0046760X.2011.598469', '10.2307/3378349', '10.2307/2702343', '10.4159/9780674972711', '10.1017/CBO9780511490439', '10.1017/CBO9781139012140', '10.1108/IJOTB-07-03-2004-B003', '10.1093/oso/9780195061215.001.0001', '10.1093/isq/sqy027', '10.1080/09612025.2013.820603', '10.1017/CBO9780511612183', '10.1525/9780520928251', '10.2307/2163478', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199704)48:4<289::AID-ASI2>3.0.CO;2-S', '10.1002/9780470998595.ch14', '10.1017/CBO9781139096829', '10.1017/S0020818300033464', '10.1017/S026021051700050X', '10.2307/j.ctt1j1w0c3', '10.1007/978-1-349-16979-5_2', '10.1017/S1752971914000232', '10.1007/s11125-015-9348-z', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199845231.001.0001', '10.9783/9780812294774', '10.1086/213005', '10.4324/9781315772394']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

This article is the first to present a theoretical account of this variation applicable to modern typeset Standard Arabic. It is suggested that diacritics serve three basic functions: facilitation of reading comprehension; facilitation of prescriptively correct diction; and to evoke associations with other texts. Six modes of diacritization in modern typeset text are identified and related to data on rates of diacritization from a corpus of electronically published books. Further lines of research based on this framework are suggested.","[('Andreas Hallberg', 'Department of Languages & Literatures, University of Gothenburg Gothenburg Sweden')]","['10.4324/9781315029535', '10.1080/19404158.2013.852980', '10.1017/CBO9780511811975', '10.1023/A:1007906222227', '10.24297/jal.v5i2.2848', '10.1111/modl.12642', '10.1016/j.jksuci.2014.06.009', '10.1080/17586801.2017.1400493', '10.1080/00437956.1959.11659702', '10.1515/MULTI.2007.020', '10.4324/9781315512778', '10.1007/s11145-020-10040-6', '10.4324/9780203883280', '10.1007/s13369-020-05258-z', '10.4236/ce.2013.44036', '10.1037/0033-295X.108.1.204', '10.1017/CBO9780511811975', '10.2307/602899', '10.1080/00437956.1959.11659702', '10.1177/0022219417718198', '10.1007/978-3-031-02139-8', '10.1057/9780230107373', '10.1515/MULTI.2007.020', '10.1177/0022219417720460', '10.1007/s11145-020-10040-6', '10.1177/0022219417718198', '10.1515/9780748627240', '10.1016/0378-2166(83)90078-4', '10.4236/ce.2013.44036', '10.1016/j.jksuci.2014.06.009', '10.1163/15700585-12341405', '10.1080/17586801.2019.1697412', '10.1037/0033-295X.108.1.204', '10.1163/24519197-12340052', '10.1057/9780230107373', '10.1515/MULTI.2007.020', '10.1007/s11145-020-10040-6', '10.4324/9781315029535', '10.1016/0378-2166(83)90078-4', '10.1017/CBO9780511486975', '10.1177/0022219417720460', '10.1016/j.jksuci.2014.06.009', '10.1080/10888438.2016.1180526', '10.1163/24519197-12340052', '10.1037/0033-2909.134.4.584', '10.1177/0022219417718198', '10.1515/9780748627240', '10.1515/MULTI.2007.020', '10.1093/jss/41.1.99', '10.1080/17586801.2015.1114910', '10.1023/B:READ.0000013831.91795.ec', '10.1037/0033-2909.134.4.584', '10.1080/19436149.2012.658499', '10.1080/17586801.2015.1114910', '10.1080/17586801.2019.1697412']",Walter de Gruyter GmbH

Efficient usage and management of abundant data are crucial for organisations, especially in the light of a lack of in-depth IT knowledge. Digital twins (DTs) are particularly expected to assist organisational processes, as behaviours of physical components are realistically represented by them using data for individual use cases. Nevertheless, DTs are extremely reliant on their use cases, leading to an extensive DT catalogue. However, a conclusive list of use cases for this accumulation of feasible DT application areas does not exist. To address this issue, this paper documents the use cases of Urban Digital Twin (UDT) platforms and applications with a state-of-the-art review. The study focuses on district-scale UDT applications that model, manage and analyse—buildings, transportation, energy, water, utility, and infrastructures that form smart cities. In order to catalogue diverse use cases found in several sectors, theoretical reasoning is developed. Our study provides a classified inventory that can be helpful for stakeholders in companies, government agencies and academia—such as researchers, architects, facilities managers, developers, and city planners.","[('P.

10.1017/ssh.2019.46,SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY,0603 World History,The Great Migration and Residential Segregation in American Cities during the Twentieth Century,[],"ABSTRACTThe Great Migration from the South and the rise of racial residential segregation strongly shaped the twentieth-century experience of African Americans. Yet, little attention has been devoted to how the two phenomena were linked, especially with respect to the individual experiences of the migrants. We address this gap by using novel data that links individual records from the complete-count 1940 Census to those in the 2000 Census long form, in conjunction with information about the level of racial residential segregation in metropolitan areas in 1940 and 2000. We first consider whether migrants from the South and their children experienced higher or lower levels of segregation in 1940 relative to their counterparts who were born in the North or who remained in the South. Next, we extend our analysis to second-generation Great Migration migrants and their segregation outcomes by observing their location in 2000. Additionally, we assess whether second-generation migrants experience larger decreases in their exposure to segregation as their socioeconomic status increases relative to their southern and/or northern stayer counterparts.

The lateral and vertical distribution of calibrated seismic facies within this framework highlights the evolution through time of the carbonate system and bathymetry of the host lacustrine basin. Despite the simple, largely abiotic and microbial components, lacustrine carbonate accumulations formed complex geometries that closely resemble those observed from marine systems, suggesting that a downward-tapering carbonate production profile must have occurred. The complexity of the stratigraphic architecture reflects lateral variations in subsidence patterns combined with the interference of the basement topography, palaeowind directions and basinal filling patterns. Well-imaged clinoforms several hundred metres high attest to both the existence of significant lake-bottom topography, locally in excess of 800 m, and the occurrence of deep water at time of deposition. Platform margin trajectory and vertical and lateral architecture of clinoform packages through time reveal distinct sequence boundaries that can be correlated in detail only locally, demonstrating the impact of syndepositional tectonics, and possibly recurrent isolation of smaller lakes during lowstands. Depositional models from this study fill a gap in current understanding of lacustrine carbonate systems and offer a template for exploration and appraisal of the presalt play.","[('M.

Fogo Island in the southern Cape Verdes is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, making it both prone to collapse (as evidenced by the c. 73 ka Monte Amarelo volcanic flank collapse), and a source of widely distributed tephra and volcanic material. The offshore distribution of the Monte Amarelo debris avalanche deposits and the surrounding volcaniclastic apron were previously mapped using only medium-resolution bathymetric data. Here, using recently acquired, higher-resolution acoustic data, we revisit Fogo's flank collapse and find evidence suggesting that the deposition of hummocky volcanic debris originating from the failed eastern flank most likely triggered the contemporaneous, multi-phase failure of pre-existing seafloor sediments. Additionally, we identify, for the first time, multiple mass-transport deposits in the southern part of the volcaniclastic apron of Fogo and Santiago based on the presence of acoustically chaotic deposits in parametric echo sounder data and volcaniclastic turbiditic sands in recovered cores. These preliminary findings indicate a long and complex history of instability on the southern slopes of Fogo and suggest that Fogo may have experienced multiple flank collapses.","[('Rachel Barrett', 'Institute of Geosciences, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24118 Kiel, Germany'), ('Elodie Lebas', 'Institute of Geosciences, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24118 Kiel, Germany'), ('Ricardo Ramalho', 'Instituto Dom Luiz, Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa, 1749-016 Lisbon, Portugal'), ('Ricardo Ramalho', 'Departamento de Geologia, Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa, 1749-016 Lisbon, Portugal'), ('Ricardo Ramalho', 'School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1RL, UK'), ('Ricardo Ramalho', 'Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, New York, NY 10964, USA'), ('Ingo Klaucke', 'GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, 24148 Kiel, Germany'), ('Steffen Kutterolf', 'GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, 24148 Kiel, Germany'), ('Andreas Klügel', 'Department of Geosciences, University of Bremen, 28359 Bremen, Germany'), ('Katja Lindhorst', 'Institute of Geosciences, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24118 Kiel, Germany'), ('Felix Gross', 'Institute of Geosciences, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24118 Kiel, Germany'), ('Felix Gross', 'Center for Ocean and Society, Kiel Marine Science, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24118 Kiel, Germany'), ('Sebastian Krastel', 'Institute of Geosciences, Christian-Albrechts-University, 24118 Kiel, Germany')]","['10.1029/2011JC007646', '10.1038/356701a0', '10.1007/s10346-019-01275-8', '10.1002/2015GC006034', '10.1007/978-3-319-57852-1_17', '10.1016/j.geomorph.2010.10.026', '10.1007/s00445-015-0905-3', '10.1038/4151014a', '10.3389/feart.2018.00223', '10.1111/j.1365-246X.1978.tb04282.x', '10.1016/S0377-0273(99)00103-1', '10.1016/j.margeo.2015.09.006', '10.5194/nhess-14-485-2014', '10.1016/j.quageo.2008.07.002', '10.1016/j.margeo.2014.03.013', '10.1002/2015GL066003', '10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04440.x', '10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(1997)123:3(102)', '10.1038/s41598-019-48327-6', '10.1007/978-3-319-00972-8_27', '10.1007/s11069-013-0681-3', '10.1029/2007JB005339', '10.1002/2015JB012061', '10.1029/2000JB900413', '10.1016/j.epsl.2019.04.009', '10.1007/978-3-319-20979-1_27', '10.1007/978-3-319-00972-8_7', '10.1029/2010GC003451', '10.1002/2017JB014959', '10.1007/978-1-4020-6512-5_35', '10.1002/2014GC005652', '10.1016/j.margeo.2016.07.001', '10.1007/s00367-013-0338-y', '10.1007/978-3-319-00972-8_1', '10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2010.07.010', '10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2019.106686', '10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2018.04.028', '10.1016/S0012-8252(01)00069-1', '10.1029/2008GC001983', '10.1144/GSL.SP.1996.110.01.01', '10.1130/G20642.1', '10.1016/j.sedgeo.2019.01.002', '10.1126/science.226.4680.1312', '10.1144/GSL.SP.1996.110.01.08', '10.1016/j.sedgeo.2011.06.006', '10.1016/j.margeo.2017.10.004', '10.1038/ngeo982', '10.1144/SP477.34', '10.1016/0377-0273(84)90002-7', '10.1007/s004450100129', '10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2008.06.014', '10.1016/j.tecto.2014.09.014', '10.1029/2000JB900450', '10.1016/j.epsl.2011.11.032', '10.1016/j.margeo.2012.08.002', '10.1016/j.epsl.2019.04.024', '10.1007/s00531-015-1144-8']",Geological Society of London

We re‐examine the age heaping–numeracy link in the light of evidence from nineteenth‐century Italian censuses, in which education explains little of the variation in age heaping. We argue that in general age heaping is most plausibly interpreted as an indicator of cultural, economic, and institutional modernization rather than a straightforward measure of individual cognitive skills. We do not rule out the use of age heaping as a numeracy indicator, but this needs to be done with research designs that are alert to historical specificities of the context under investigation.","[(""Brian A'Hearn"", 'Pembroke College University of Oxford'), ('Alexia Delfino', 'IGIER and LEAP Bocconi University  Milan'), ('Alessandro Nuvolari', ""Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies  Pisa"")]","['10.1017/S0022050709001120', '10.1162/REST_a_00403', '10.1016/j.eeh.2009.09.003', '10.1080/03585522.2015.1032339', '10.1111/ehr.12333', '10.1111/ehr.12615', '10.1111/pirs.12217', '10.1093/ereh/hey014', '10.1016/j.eeh.2009.05.004', '10.1163/9789004236950', '10.1162/JINH_a_00049', '10.1515/9780773574618', '10.1017/9781108539913', '10.1017/S002205071100218X', '10.1093/ereh/heu018', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00582.x', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199936694.013.0010', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199944590.003.0007', '10.1080/03585522.2012.727763', '10.1017/CBO9780511790881', '10.1007/BF00273112', '10.1016/j.eeh.2012.12.002', '10.1017/S0010417500018727', '10.1086/688053', '10.1126/science.1238041', '10.1016/0014-4983(82)90008-0', '10.2307/1402833', '10.1017/CBO9780511523458', '10.3917/redp.301.0051', '10.1177/036319909001500123', '10.2307/1130503', '10.1086/217540', '10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.04.006', '10.1017/S0003055420000933', '10.1080/01615440.2017.1393359', '10.2307/3679153', '10.1093/past/38.1.56', '10.1007/978-3-642-40406-1_24', '10.1177/0265691414523549']",Wiley

The technique has been employed on metamorphic samples exceeding temperatures of 270°C, but recently has been shown to be effective at lower temperatures. Thermal maturation techniques commonly depend on sample size, have varying efficacies at different temperatures and in different conditions. The underlying processes are not well understood, thus data interpretation can be ambiguous. Here we show the efficacy of Raman as a low-temperature thermal marker in a thrust belt. The Bornes region, in a French Subalpine chain, provides an opportunity to test the technique against published vitrinite reflectance data and thermal modelling for the first time. In doing so we show that Raman is an effective thermal marker to temperatures as low as 75°C, has a small error and is consistent with previous work. The Raman data allow us to postulate the relative thickness of the sedimentary succession across the chain, the timing of thermal maturation and the timing and thickness variations of the over-thrust Prealpine nappe. The work establishes Raman as a low-temperature thermal marker for correlation with other techniques to ensure effective and robust interpretation, that can readily be applied to fold–thrust belts in hydrocarbon provinces.","[('D.

They are associated in space and time with ultrapotassic shoshonites and high-K calc-alkaline rocks. This magmatism is linked with the geodynamic evolution of the westernmost sector of the Alpine–Himalayan collisional margin, which followed the closure of the Tethys Ocean. Subduction-related lamproites, lamprophyres, shoshonites and high-K calc-alkaline suites were emplaced in the Mediterranean region in the form of shallow level intrusions (e.g. plugs, dykes and laccoliths) and small volume lava flows, with very subordinate pyroclastic rocks, starting from the Oligocene, in the Western Alps (northern Italy), through the Late Miocene in Corsica (southern France) and in Murcia-Almeria (southeastern Spain), to the Plio-Pleistocene in Southern Tuscany and Northern Latium (central Italy), in the Balkan peninsula (Serbia and Macedonia) and in the Western Anatolia (Turkey). The ultrapotassic rocks are mostly lamprophyric, but olivine latitic lavas with a clear lamproitic affinity are also found, as well as dacitic to trachytic differentiated products. Lamproite-like rocks range from slightly silica under-saturated to silica over-saturated composition, have relatively low Al 2 O 3 , CaO and Na 2 O contents, resulting in plagioclase-free parageneses, and consist of abundant K-feldspar, phlogopite, diopsidic clinopyroxene and highly forsteritic olivine. Leucite is generally absent, and it is rarely found only in the groundmasses of Spanish lamproites. Mediterranean lamproites and associated rocks share an extreme enrichment in many incompatible trace elements and depletion in High Field Strength Elements and high, and positively correlated Th/La and Sm/La ratios. They have radiogenic Sr and unradiogenic Nd isotope compositions, high 207 Pb over 206 Pb and high time-integrated 232 Th/ 238 U. Their composition requires an originally depleted lithospheric mantle source metasomatized by at least two different agents: (1) a high Th/La and Sm/La (i.e. SALATHO) component deriving from lawsonite-bearing, ancient crustal domains likely hosted in mélanges formed during the diachronous collision of the northward drifting continental slivers from Gondwana; (2) a K-rich component derived from a recent subduction and recycling of siliciclastic sediments. These metasomatic melts produced a lithospheric mantle source characterized by network of felsic and phlogopite-rich veins, respectively. Geothermal readjustment during post-collisional events induced progressive melting of the different types of veins and the surrounding peridotite generating the entire compositional spectrum of the observed magmas. In this complex scenario, orogenic Mediterranean lamproites represent rocks that characterize areas that were affected by multiple Wilson cycles, as observed in the Alpine–Himalayan Realm.","[('Martina Casalini', 'Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Via Giorgio La Pira, 4, I-50121, Firenze, Italy'), ('Riccardo Avanzinelli', 'Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Via Giorgio La Pira, 4, I-50121, Firenze, Italy'), ('Riccardo Avanzinelli', 'CNR – Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse, sede secondaria di Firenze, Via Giorgio La Pira, 4, I-50121, Firenze, Italy'), ('Simone Tommasini', 'Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Via Giorgio La Pira, 4, I-50121, Firenze, Italy'), ('Claudio Natali', 'Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Via Giorgio La Pira, 4, I-50121, Firenze, Italy'), ('Claudio Natali', 'CNR – Istituto di Geologia Ambientale e Geoingegneria, sede primaria di Montelibretti, Area della Ricerca di Roma-1, via Salaria km 29.600, I-00015, Monterotondo (RM), Italy'), ('Gianluca Bianchini', 'Dipartimento di Fisica e Scienze della Terra, Università degli Studi di Ferrara, Via Giuseppe Saragat, 1, I-44122, Ferrara, Italy'), ('Dejan Prelević', 'Institut für Geowissenschaften, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, J.-J.- Becher-Weg 21, D-55128, Mainz, Germany'), ('Dejan Prelević', 'Department of Petrology and Geochemistry, University of Belgrade, RS-11000, Belgrade, Serbia'), ('Massimo Mattei', 'Dipartimento di Scienze, Università degli Studi di Roma TRE, Largo S.

A new software tool (Rcrust) has been developed that allows the modelling of points in pressure–temperature–bulk composition space in which bulk compositional changes can be passed from point to point as the system evolves. This new methodology enables quantitative process-oriented investigation of the evolution of rocks. Procedures are outlined here for using this tool to model: (1) the control of the water content of a subsolidus system based on available pore space; (2) the triggering of melt loss events when a critical melt volume threshold is exceeded, while allowing a portion of melt retention; (3) the entrainment of crystals during segregation and ascent of granitic magmas from its source; (4) the modification of the composition of granite magmas owing to fractional crystallization; and (5) the progressive availability (through dissolution) of slow diffusing species and their control of the effective bulk composition of a system. These cases collectively illustrate thermodynamically constrained methods for modelling systems that involve mass transfer.","[('Matthew Jason Mayne', 'University of Stellenbosch, Department of Earth Sciences, Private Bag X1, 7602 Matieland, South Africa'), ('Matthew Jason Mayne', 'Université de Lyon, Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans, UJM-UCA-CNRS-IRD, 42023 Saint-Etienne, France'), ('Gary Stevens', 'University of Stellenbosch, Department of Earth Sciences, Private Bag X1, 7602 Matieland, South Africa'), ('Jean-François Moyen', 'Université de Lyon, Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans, UJM-UCA-CNRS-IRD, 42023 Saint-Etienne, France'), ('Tim Johnson', 'Curtin University, Department of Applied Geology, WA 6845 Perth, Australia')]","['10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019<0855:EFMMTA>2.3.CO;2', '10.1093/petrology/egh019', '10.1007/978-1-4419-0346-4_4', '10.1016/j.epsl.2005.04.033', '10.1029/2009GC002540', '10.1016/0364-5916(87)90018-6', '10.2138/am.2010.3354', '10.1002/2014JB011088', '10.1016/j.lithos.2016.09.028', '10.1016/j.lithos.2016.09.027', '10.1016/j.precamres.2017.12.026', '10.1007/BF00307281', '10.2138/am-1996-11-1215', '10.1007/s00410-003-0464-z', '10.1111/j.1525-1314.2010.00923.x', '10.1046/j.1440-0952.2001.00876.x', '10.1093/petrology/44.5.789', '10.1016/j.lithos.2010.08.009', '10.2475/ajs.297.8.767', '10.1111/j.1525-1314.2011.00954.x', '10.1515/9783110561890-004', '10.1111/jmg.12429', '10.1111/jmg.12199', '10.1016/j.oregeorev.2015.11.012', '10.1126/science.225.4661.504', '10.1016/j.gsf.2017.12.009', '10.1111/jmg.12265', '10.1111/j.1525-1314.1988.tb00415.x', '10.1111/j.1525-1314.1998.00157.x', '10.1111/j.1525-1314.2004.00527.x', '10.1111/j.1525-1314.2005.00555.x', '10.1016/j.chemgeo.2017.03.011', '10.1130/G22959A.1', '10.1007/s00410-006-0143-y', '10.1111/jmg.12087', '10.1046/j.1365-3121.2000.00299.x', '10.1130/G35718.1', '10.1111/jmg.12299', '10.1046/j.1525-1314.2002.00206_20_7.x', '10.1111/j.1525-1314.2010.00881.x', '10.1046/j.1525-1314.2000.00269.x', '10.1046/j.0263-4929.2001.00349.x', '10.1046/j.1525-1314.2003.00454.x', '10.1111/jmg.12071', '10.2138/am.2010.3371', '10.12789/geocanj.2017.44.114', '10.1144/jgs2013-039', '10.1111/jmg.12307', '10.2138/am.2005.1741']",Geological Society of London

Beyond drawing parallels between the cholera epidemics and the current crisis, the article argues for combining imperial and social histories in order to write richer and more grounded histories of internationalism. It explores this historiographical and methodological challenge by analysing the boardrooms of the international sanitary conferences, Middle Eastern quarantine stations catering for Mecca pilgrims, and ocean steamships aiming to move without delay during a worldwide health crisis.","[('Valeska Huber', '')]",[],Cambridge University Press (CUP)

They have been underexploited in studies of younger lake sediments, either ignored or only qualitatively observed, because many NPP are destroyed by standard processing techniques for pollen and embryophyte spores. The palaeoenvironmental potential of palynomorphs, with representatives from all eukaryotic kingdoms as well as cyanobacteria and from all trophic levels in various lacustrine environments, has been recognized by a few Quaternary palynologists in the past few decades. NPP have proven particularly valuable in archaeological and environmental monitoring studies of human impact on freshwater ecosystems, with spores of some fungi and eggs/egg cases of some flatworms and roundworms associated with faeces of humans and livestock, and the acid-resistant remains of various life stages of cyanobacteria, algae and their aquatic consumers responding to increased turbidity and nutrient influx associated with permanent human settlements, particularly those associated with agricultural activity. Descriptions of NPP commonly encountered in Quaternary lake sediments and case studies illustrating applications to various research questions should encourage more palynologists that ‘“Quaternary non-pollen palynomorphs” deserve our attention!’, to quote Prof. Bas van Geel (2006, Review of Paleobotany and Palynology , 141 , vii–viii, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2006.04.001 ), undisputed Father of NPP research.","[('Francine M.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF or NeRFs) are to date emerging as a novel method for synthesizing novel views of complex 3D scenes, leveraging an artificial neural network to optimize a volumetric scene function using a set of input views. We conduct a preliminary critical review of the scientific and technical literature on NeRFs, and we highlight possible applications of the latter in the Cultural Heritage domain, for the image-based reconstruction of 3D models of real, multi-scale objects, even in combination with the more well-established photogrammetric techniques. A comparison is made between NeRFs and photogrammetry in terms of operating procedures and outputs (volumetric renderings vs. point clouds or meshes). It is demonstrated that NeRFs could be conveniently used for rendering objects (sculptures, archaeological remains, sites, paintings etc.) that are challenging for photogrammetry, typically: i) metallic, translucent, and/or transparent surfaces; ii) objects that present homogeneous textures; iii) occlusions, vegetation, and elements of very fine detail.","[('V.

10.1111/ehr.12997,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Living standards and the life cycle: reconstructing household income and consumption in the early twentieth-century Netherlands†,[],"AbstractConventional methods of measuring historical household living standards are often criticized because of the omission of women's and children's wages and non‐wage income; the focus on urban centres; and the exclusion of life‐cycle changes in household composition, income, and consumption. This article presents a method that accounts for these issues and applies it to agricultural and textile households in the early‐twentieth century Netherlands. It uses total household income, as opposed to the husband's wage, as the enumerator for calculating alternative welfare ratios. The results show that welfare ratios were not only structurally higher than those based on the male‐breadwinner model, but also followed a different life‐cycle trajectory. Furthermore, household portfolios were diversified and depended on local labour market structures. Thus, the study concludes that analyses based on men's wages only reflect the rough outlines of how households functioned.","[('Corinne Boter', 'Utrecht University')]","['10.1006/exeh.2001.0775', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00515.x', '10.1016/j.eeh.2011.12.001', '10.1080/1081602X.2016.1163275', '10.1111/1468-0289.00200', '10.1017/S0022050712000630', '10.1111/ehr.12377', '10.1017/S0268416000002101', '10.1016/S1081-602X(03)00006-X', '10.1093/hwj/23.1.59', '10.1093/hwj/35.1.78', '10.2307/2597872', '10.1016/j.eeh.2007.12.001', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2012.00663.x', '10.1080/13545701.2012.746465', '10.1017/S0022050715000662', '10.2307/2234892', '10.1017/S0022050700075495', '10.1080/13545701.2012.738302', '10.1111/ehr.12424', '10.1080/1081602X.2014.955515', '10.2307/2551457', '10.1111/ehr.12733', '10.1080/13545701.2012.734630', '10.1016/j.eeh.2012.08.001', '10.1017/S136149169900009X', '10.1163/9789004299665', '10.1093/ereh/hev007']",Wiley

Design/methodology/approach A literature review was carried out on the theme of HE work-based and work-integrated learning during the pandemic, followed by minimally-structured interviews with UK university staff responsible for apprenticeship and other work-based programmes. Findings The pandemic has accelerated adoption of online and digital methods to support work-based and apprenticeship learning. There has been progress from emergency measures to more pedagogically consistent ones. A blended approach is becoming common, with the learning and logistical benefits from digital methods ensuring their continuing use. Progress is uneven and there is still a need for improved digital pedagogy and better integration of theoretical and practical learning. Practical implications More attention is needed to digital pedagogy and to effective use of online methods to support work-based learning with corresponding implications for staff development. There are institutional implications in terms of ensuring that systems and structures support what is, particularly for work-based learners, likely to be a permanent move towards digital, blended and online learning. Originality/value There has been limited research on the impact of the pandemic on work-based learning, with most of the literature focusing on placements and projects. This paper presents findings at a point when universities are considering how technologically-supported methods will be employed on a more permanent basis.","[('Stan Lester', 'Stan Lester Developments , Dulverton,'), ('Mandy Crawford–Lee', 'UVAC , Bolton,')]","['10.1007/s10639-021-10507-1', '10.1080/13678868.2020.1778999', '10.1108/HESWBL-03-2020-0035', '10.4018/978-1-5225-6977-0.ch003', '10.1108/HESWBL-11-2020-172', '10.1108/HESWBL-05-2019-123', '10.1080/03075079.2021.1894116', '10.3390/educsci10100291', '10.1108/HESWBL-04-2016-0023', '10.1108/HESWBL-06-2020-0134', '10.1108/JRIT-10-2020-0051', '10.1108/JWAM-01-2021-0010', '10.1108/HESWBL-05-2020-0104', '10.1080/03075070903216635', '10.1108/HESWBL-04-2020-0071', '10.1080/02615479.2020.1836145', '10.4018/978-1-7998-6440-0.ch008', '10.53761/1.18.5.2', '10.1080/10963758.2021.1907198', '10.5694/mja2.50765', '10.1108/EJTD-01-2021-0015', '10.1080/14739879.2020.1772123', '10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00621', '10.1108/HESWBL-02-2019-0022', '10.1108/HESWBL-05-2020-0105', '10.17645/si.v9i3.4125', '10.1108/JWAM-01-2021-0003']",Emerald

They originated from primary mantle-derived melts that intruded both cratons and off-craton regions, which were parts of former supercontinents – Columbia, Rodinia and Gondwana–Pangaea. Well known for hosting economic minerals and elements such as diamonds, base metals, platinum-group elements and Au, they are also significant for our understanding of deep-mantle processes, such as mantle metasomatism and mantle plume–lithosphere interactions, as well as large-scale geodynamic processes, including subduction-related tectonics and supercontinent amalgamation and break-up. This Special Publication presents an overview of the state of the art and recent advances as achieved by individual research groups from different parts of the world, and outlines future research directions. Mineralogical, geochemical, geochronological and isotope analyses are used to decipher the complex petrogenetic and metallogenetic evolution of these extraordinary rocks and unravel a complete history of tectonic events related to individual supercontinent cycles. The Special Publication including this introductory chapter also deals with some issues related to the classification of these rocks.","[('Lukáš Krmíček', 'Institute of Geology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Rozvojová 269, CZ-165 02, Praha 6, Czech Republic'), ('Lukáš Krmíček', 'Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Institute of Geotechnics, Veveří 95, CZ-602 00 Brno, Czech Republic'), ('N.

It outlines how an increasingly mature literature emerged around the domestic political and foreign policy drivers of kin-state politics as scholars drew from a number of perspectives, from the literature on irredentism to that on diaspora politics and transborder nationalism. The article then evaluates scholarship on the drivers and impacts of kin-state politics, with a focus on the consequences of kin-state politics for the cultural and political landscape of external kin communities and the impact on regional security and stability. While a rich and nuanced literature has helped to contextualize the tensions and complexities of the former, I argue that the latter needs to be developed further. Careful work needs to be done to more precisely establish the conditions under which kin-state politics constitute a security threat. Future scholarship should bring together a more ground level perspective of how kin-state policies are perceived, utilized, and/or instrumentalized by their intended subjects with a critical understanding of how the “game” of kin-state politics is played within the home state and the kin-state.","[('Myra A.

Cooling of high-latitudinal areas may have been caused by orogenic processes at the northern margin of the Tethys Ocean that reduced heat transport towards the polar regions. Warm phases correlate to periods of intensified volcanism. The Jenkyns Event occurred during the transition from a late Pliensbachian icehouse into an early Toarcian greenhouse. Parallel evolution of different environmental processes, including sea level, climate and carbon cycle, indicate a causal mechanism tied to astronomical forcing. Insolation-controlled variations in the extent of the cryosphere (ice caps and permafrost) facilitated orbitally paced sea-level cycles via waxing and waning of the polar ice caps, and negative carbon isotope excursions via the release of cryosphere-bound 12 C-enriched carbon. This review and synthesis of sedimentological, geochemical and palaeontological palaeoenvironment indicators, and of simulations from climate models, aims to reconstruction, in particular, the high-latitudinal environmental conditions of late Pliensbachian–early Toarcian times. Focus is laid on the extent of the regions that were potentially suitable for hosting a cryosphere. An environmental response to cryosphere dynamics is considered to have been a key component of the Jenkyns Event.","[('Wolfgang Ruebsam', 'Department of Organic and Isotope Geochemistry, Institute of

However, like their real-numbered counterpart, quantized networks are not immune to malicious misclassification caused by adversarial attacks. We investigate how quantization affects a network’s robustness to adversarial attacks, which is a formal verification question. We show that neither robustness nor non-robustness are monotonic with changing the number of bits for the representation and, also, neither are preserved by quantization from a real-numbered network. For this reason, we introduce a verification method for quantized neural networks which, using SMT solving over bit-vectors, accounts for their exact, bit-precise semantics. We built a tool and analyzed the effect of quantization on a classifier for the MNIST dataset. We demonstrate that, compared to our method, existing methods for the analysis of real-numbered networks often derive false conclusions about their quantizations, both when determining robustness and when detecting attacks, and that existing methods for quantized networks often miss attacks. Furthermore, we applied our method beyond robustness, showing how the number of bits in quantization enlarges the gender bias of a predictor for students’ grades.","[('Mirco Giacobbe', ''), ('Thomas A.

Since it requires a deep semantic and linguistic understanding of the question and the ability to associate it with various objects that are present in the image, it is an ambitious task and requires multi-modal reasoning from both computer vision and natural language processing. We propose Graphhopper, a novel method that approaches the task by integrating knowledge graph reasoning, computer vision, and natural language processing techniques. Concretely, our method is based on performing context-driven, sequential reasoning based on the scene entities and their semantic and spatial relationships. As a first step, we derive a scene graph that describes the objects in the image, as well as their attributes and their mutual relationships. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning agent is trained to autonomously navigate in a multi-hop manner over the extracted scene graph to generate reasoning paths, which are the basis for deriving answers. We conduct an experimental study on the challenging dataset GQA, based on both manually curated and automatically generated scene graphs. Our results show that we keep up with human performance on manually curated scene graphs. Moreover, we find that Graphhopper outperforms another state-of-the-art scene graph reasoning model on both manually curated and automatically generated scene graphs by a significant margin.","[('Rajat Koner', ''), ('Hang Li', ''), ('Marcel Hildebrandt', ''), ('Deepan Das', ''), ('Volker Tresp', ''), ('Stephan Günnemann', '')]","['10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.01006', '10.1109/CVPR.2018.00636', '10.1109/CVPR.2016.12', '10.1109/ICCV.2015.279', '10.1109/CVPR.2019.00209', '10.1109/ICCV.2019.00471', '10.1609/aaai.v34i04.6600', '10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735', '10.1109/ICCV.2017.93', '10.1109/CVPR.2019.00686', '10.1109/CVPR.2017.215', '10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298990', '10.1007/s11263-016-0981-7', '10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48', '10.1109/JPROC.2015.2483592', '10.3115/v1/D14-1162', '10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01008', '10.1109/CVPR.2019.00857', '10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00377', '10.1109/CVPR.2017.344', '10.18653/v1/D17-1060', '10.1109/CVPR.2016.10', '10.1109/ICCV.2017.202', '10.1109/ICCV.2017.145']",Springer International Publishing

Attending in particular to reproductive labor in all its forms, and to the centrality of gender relations to the transmission of property and status, enables greater understanding of Atlantic slavery as a critically important aspect of modern global history. Indeed, without attention to gender and specifically to reproductive work, the global history of Atlantic slavery will inevitably be partial and incomplete. The reproductive work of women in Africa, as well as in the Americas, should be understood as an integral part of the development of Atlantic slavery, and thus of racial capitalism.","[('Diana Paton', 'University of Edinburgh , UK')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Zircon populations from 10 stratigraphic horizons in the Yellow Cat Member yield youngest single-grain ages ranging from 142.5 ± 2.7 to 133.7 ± 2.7 Ma (Berriasian–late Valanginian); those from one mudstone palaeosol yield a robust Concordia Age of 136.3 ± 1.3 (Valanginian). Additionally, a new palynoflora – one of a few to be published from the Cedar Mountain Formation – is assigned to the middle Berriasian to early Hauterivian stages, based on the presence of Foraminisporis wonthaggiensis and Trilobosporites sp. cf. T. canadensis , and the absence of F . asymmetricus , Appendicisporites spp. and angiosperms. Furthermore, these chronostratigraphic data allow us to interpret part of the so-called ‘Weissert Event’ C-isotope excursion (Valanginian) in a new C-isotope profile through a palaeosol-bearing alluvial succession in the Yellow Cat Member. This research extends a firm understanding of the formation further back into the Early Cretaceous than was the case previously (except for ostracod biostratigraphy) and sets the stage for future advancements.","[('R.

Crucial for this enterprise was interpreting the Soviet past. Although the latter was used for political purposes by both Boris Yeltsin (who attempted to break with it) and Vladimir Putin (who established continuity with it), a politically usable interpretation of the Russian Revolutions was never found. Such is the consensus that emerged in 2017. Challenging this consensus, I argue that a specific interpretation of the Revolutions—nested within a narrative that covers Russia’s history from Kievan Rus to the contemporary Russian Federation—has been developed in Russia. Turning Russia’s politically problematic past into a politically usable one, this interpretation is (re)produced through the project Russia—My History. As Russia—My History (initially developed within the Russian Orthodox Church) is becoming a part of state-sponsored efforts to forge an “official” vision of Russian history, the interpretation of the Revolutions (re)produced through it is growing in influence in present-day Russia.","[('Ekaterina V.

Contrary to the conventional narrative about a “sectarian journey” torn between a flawed primordialist and instrumentalist approach in between which a new superior “third way” is needed, the article shows that both primordialism and instrumentalism are rare in the academic debate on sectarianism, quite similar to the broader ethnicity/nationalism debate. However, this has not resulted in a “new conventional wisdom” about how to proceed. Thus, the article identifies a cacophony of suggestions for how the much aspired‐to third way should look like. Against this background, the article suggests that it is time to go beyond the ritual calls to “get beyond primordialism and instrumentalism.” Instead, it is time to devote more attention to examining the multiple already existing suggestions for “third ways”. Rather than highlighting a single third way as superior, the article contributes to this move in two ways: it shows how the various third ways can be grouped into three “beyond strategies” (the New Saviour, the Baby and the Bathwater, and the LEGO eclectic strategies) and outlines a number of meta‐theoretical issues to consider in order to move the debate forward.","[('Morten Valbjørn', 'Department of Political Science Aarhus University  Aarhus Denmark')]","['10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190233143.001.0001', '10.1080/01419870902763878', '10.1093/dh/dhv034', '10.1177/1065912917717641', '10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-115916', '10.1163/9789047404279', '10.1080/00396338.2014.882157', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199893157.001.0001', '10.1080/23269995.2016.1259231', '10.1017/S0020743808081476', '10.1111/johs.12189', '10.1111/nana.12579', '10.3751/68.1.12', '10.1080/13698249.2019.1595881', '10.1017/S1049096519000143', '10.3751/71.3.12', '10.1111/nana.12578', '10.1111/johs.12190', '10.1111/nana.12582', '10.1080/01436597.2017.1282818', '10.1017/S0020818300027363', '10.1515/9780691219752', '10.1017/S0003975600004239', '10.1515/9780804787222', '10.1080/13530198408705383', '10.1080/01436597.2015.1015788', '10.1080/09592318.2018.1455328', '10.1080/00396339308442672', '10.3751/69.4.13', '10.2307/j.ctt183p3d5', '10.1080/13510347.2015.1010813', '10.2307/587365', '10.1007/978-1-137-01359-0', '10.4324/9780203876558', '10.1111/sena.12289', '10.1111/sena.12293', '10.1017/CBO9780511660054.009', '10.2307/j.ctvjf9zdr', '10.2307/1389517']",Wiley

Almost sure termination (AST) is concerned with the question whether a program terminates with probability one on all possible inputs. Positive almost sure termination (PAST) focuses on termination in a finite expected number of steps. This paper presents a fully automated approach to the termination analysis of probabilistic while-programs whose guards and expressions are polynomial expressions. As proving (positive) AST is undecidable in general, existing proof rules typically provide sufficient conditions. These conditions mostly involve constraints on supermartingales. We consider four proof rules from the literature and extend these with generalizations of existing proof rules for (P)AST. We automate the resulting set of proof rules by effectively computing asymptotic bounds on polynomials over the program variables. These bounds are used to decide the sufficient conditions – including the constraints on supermartingales – of a proof rule. Our software tool Amber can thus check AST, PAST, as well as their negations for a large class of polynomial probabilistic programs, while carrying out the termination reasoning fully with polynomial witnesses. Experimental results show the merits of our generalized proof rules and demonstrate that Amber can handle probabilistic programs that are out of reach for other state-of-the-art tools.","[('Marcel Moosbrugger', ''), ('Ezio Bartocci', ''), ('Joost-Pieter Katoen', ''), ('Laura Kovács', '')]","['10.1145/3158122', '10.1785/0120120107', '10.1016/j.scico.2019.102338', '10.1007/978-3-030-31784-3_15', '10.1007/978-3-030-64276-1_12', '10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5', '10.1080/08929882.2015.1039431', '10.1007/978-3-540-32033-3_24', '10.1007/b105073', '10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_34', '10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_1', '10.1145/3174800', '10.1145/3009837.3009873', '10.1145/3385412.3386002', '10.1007/11817963_37', '10.1145/1941487.1941509', '10.1145/3293605', '10.1007/978-3-642-31424-7_14', '10.1145/2676726.2677001', '10.1145/3314221.3314633', '10.1007/s10817-016-9388-y', '10.1007/978-3-030-29436-6_16', '10.3929/ETHZ-A-001631582', '10.29007/nxv1', '10.1145/3371105', '10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_30', '10.1145/363235.363259', '10.1007/978-3-030-02768-1_11', '10.1145/3360555', '10.1007/978-3-662-48057-1_24', '10.1145/3208102', '10.1007/978-3-7091-0445-3', '10.1007/978-1-4684-9455-6', '10.1016/0022-0000(81)90036-2', '10.1016/0022-0000(85)90012-1', '10.1007/978-3-662-54577-5_29', '10.1145/1059816.1059824', '10.1145/3158121', '10.1007/3-540-47764-0', '10.26226/morressier.604907f41a80aac83ca25d19', '10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3', '10.1145/3192366.3192394', '10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_28', '10.1007/978-3-319-08918-8_32']",Springer International Publishing

They are generated by partial melting of diverse crustal and mantle sources and subsequent differentiation of the primary magmas, and are formed through a variety of geodynamic processes. Granitoids, therefore, are important archives for early Earth lithospheric evolution. Peninsular India comprises five cratonic blocks bordered by mobile belts. The cratons that stabilized during the Paleoarchean–Mesoarchean (Singhbhum and Western Dharwar) recorded mostly diapirism or sagduction tectonics. Conversely, cratons that stabilized during the late Neoarchean (Eastern Dharwar, Bundelkhand, Bastar and Aravalli) show evidence consistent with terrane accretion–collision in a convergent setting. Thus, the Indian cratons provide testimony to a transition from a dominantly pre-plate tectonic regime in the Paleoarchean–Mesoarchean to a plate-tectonic-like regime in the late Neoarchean. Despite this diversity, all five cratons had a similar petrological evolution with a long period (250–850 myr) of episodic tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG) magmatism followed by a shorter period (30–100 myr) of granitoid diversification (sanukitoid, K-rich anatectic granite and A-type granite) with signatures of input from both mantle and crust. The contributions of this Special Publication cover diverse granitoid-related themes, highlighting the potential of Indian cratons in addressing global issues of Archean crustal evolution.","[('Sukanta Dey', 'Department of Earth Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Mohanpur, Nadia 741 246, West Bengal, India'), ('Jean-François Moyen', 'Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans, UJM-UCA-CNRS-IRD, Université de Lyon, 23 rue Dr Paul Michelon, 42023 Saint Etienne, France')]","['10.1144/SP489-2018-195', '10.18814/epiiugs/2020/020003', '10.1144/SP489-2019-315', '10.1016/0012-821X(95)00144-2', '10.1098/rsta.2017.0405', '10.1016/S0301-9268(99)00055-8', '10.1016/S0301-9268(97)00007-7', '10.1016/B978-0-444-63901-1.00021-6', '10.1029/2010GC003398', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103085', '10.1038/s41598-018-25494-6', '10.1016/j.precamres.2012.05.005', '10.1144/SP449.9', '10.1016/j.precamres.2017.06.009', '10.1016/B978-0-444-63901-1.00030-7', '10.1144/SP489-2019-202', '10.18814/epiiugs/2020/020005', '10.1016/j.precamres.2007.08.005', '10.1016/S1367-9120(03)00136-6', '10.2465/jmps.190824a', '10.1016/j.precamres.2017.09.016', '10.1144/SP449.10', '10.1016/j.lithos.2016.01.016', '10.1007/978-3-030-42845-7', '10.1016/j.gr.2019.09.005', '10.1007/978-3-030-15989-4_2', '10.1144/SP489-2018-125', '10.1144/SP449.8', '10.1016/j.precamres.2014.09.019', '10.1016/j.precamres.2016.06.005', '10.1016/j.precamres.2019.03.004', '10.1016/j.gr.2014.10.010', '10.1016/j.precamres.2016.01.009', '10.1144/SP489-2019-292', '10.1016/j.gr.2015.12.008', '10.1016/j.gr.2017.06.005', '10.1016/j.lithos.2004.04.048', '10.1086/698844', '10.1016/j.precamres.2019.105436', '10.1016/j.precamres.2013.12.017', '10.1144/SP489-2019-108', '10.1144/SP489-2019-311', '10.1144/SP489-2018-34', '10.1016/S0301-9268(03)00183-9', '10.18814/epiiugs/2020/020002', '10.1016/j.oregeorev.2015.05.020', '10.1016/S1342-937X(05)70757-7', '10.1098/rsta.2018.0103', '10.1016/j.precamres.2014.09.024', '10.1144/SP489-2018-88', '10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.02.040', '10.1144/SP489-2019-342', '10.1007/s00126-004-0441-0', '10.1016/j.precamres.2012.06.009', '10.1016/j.precamres.2013.03.009', '10.1144/0016-76492008-089', '10.1016/j.precamres.2020.105630', '10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116206', '10.1007/978-3-319-89698-4_22', '10.1029/2018GL078114', '10.1017/S0016756815000692', '10.1016/j.gr.2019.09.012', '10.1016/0301-9268(93)90097-L', '10.1017/CBO9781139196123', '10.1007/s12594-016-0519-1', '10.1144/SP489-2018-72', '10.1144/SP489-2019-287', '10.1016/j.gsf.2019.02.001', '10.1086/629023', '10.1016/j.jseaes.2015.05.023', '10.1016/S0301-9268(02)00212-7']",Geological Society of London
10.1093/pastj/gtab022,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,"Aliens in a Revolutionary World: Refugees, Migration Control and Subjecthood in the British Atlantic, 1790s-1820s*",[],"Abstract During the political and military upheavals between the 1770s and 1820s, societies and states across the Atlantic world grappled with intricate issues of political belonging and sovereignty. Along with the rise of new concepts of national citizenship, older concepts of monarchical or imperial subjecthood underwent fundamental changes. While scholars tend to ascribe these transformations to revolutionary innovation, the movement of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing revolutions and violent conflict was no less important in reshaping the terms of political membership. In response to these migrations, national and colonial governments passed legislation meant to control the mobility of foreign refugees. Based on the case of three men of colour, the sons of Haitian refugees, deported from Jamaica in 1823, this article explores the wider impact the regulation of alien status had. The 1823 incident set off a major legal battle and a sprawling debate about the terms of membership in the transforming British Empire. The affair raised fundamental questions about the status and rights of foreigners, the definition of who was a subject of the British Crown, and about how sovereignty was to be conceived in a period of continuous territorial transfers and military occupations.","[('Jan C Jansen', 'University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

On March 24, 1976, the Argentine military staged a coup d’état and established a dictatorship, perpetrating mass civilian murder until democratic transition in 1983. Drawing on state intelligence archive surveillance documents, the artist-activist intervention Campaña DESAPARECER, and travesti and transgender testimony, this article argues that the enduring social and political legacies of interwar fascism not only persisted into the years of dictatorship, but that they also continue to animate and mediate post-dictatorship transgender politics. That is, in democracy, the enduring afterlife of fascism creates conditions of possibility for activists to mobilize the language of anti-fascism and shared memories of fascist state violence in the service of contemporary transgender rights claims. Such rights claims reveal illiberal state violence’s deadly imbrications with the politics of sex and gender during dictatorship and, at the same time, challenge present-day liberal narratives that relegate state violence to a distant illiberal past.","[('Cole Rizki', '')]","['10.1177/0891243207306383', '10.1215/23289252-7090087', '10.1215/10642684-7551140', '10.5149/northcarolina/9781469627502.001.0001', '10.1215/23289252-7348510', '10.1080/0966369X.2015.1058756', '10.1353/aq.2014.0055', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199930241.001.0001', '10.1215/23289252-7348482', '10.5149/northcarolina/9781469611617.001.0001', '10.1017/S0022216X14000686', '10.1215/23289252-7348426', '10.1177/1470412920941905', '10.2307/j.ctv11smz1k.10']",Duke University Press

Here we share our analysis of a survey of 314 PDWs, conducted between April and May 2020, confirming that PDWs in Peru are highly unprotected, particularly during the COVID pandemic, in which there has been a lack of comprehensive social protection schemes.","[('Leda M.

In order to obtain a deeper understanding of historical urban space and spatial relationships, the contributors to this Special Issue deploy new techniques of spatial analysis using mapping tools to explore the density, frequency and proximity of various features of towns and cities. The contributors focus on case-studies at various urban scales – from major commercial centres (New York, Rome, Paris and London) – to smaller towns in the urban hierarchy. They also range across the tenth to the twentieth centuries and so challenge a common assumption that mapping the town is essentially an approach best suited to the modern period. Individually and collectively, the authors demonstrate how the urban morphology of the city developed and how durable that spatial patterning can be.","[('Richard Rodger', ''), ('Susanne Rau', '')]","['10.4324/9781315817064', '10.1007/978-3-319-00993-3', '10.1515/9783110494983', '10.1177/0309132507081495', '10.2307/j.ctv550dcj', '10.1177/0042098016634002', '10.1016/j.jhg.2007.06.003', '10.1177/0096144215579376', '10.4324/9781315610269', '10.1353/dss.2010.0020', '10.7788/9783412508517', '10.4000/books.pur.22717', '10.2307/j.ctt1zxxzr2', '10.1007/978-94-007-5009-8', '10.2307/j.ctv513drk', '10.1017/S0963926812000405', '10.1080/01615440.2010.517509', '10.1017/S0145553200011639', '10.1017/S0963926800016874', '10.1177/1538513210366964', '10.1017/S0963926818000585']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Drawing parallels between economic nationalisms in Central Europe and East Asia, it focuses on Poland and Hungary and asks why did these countries turn to economic nationalism. The article traces this turn to ideational foundations developed by right‐wing intellectuals over the last two decades, arguing that right‐wing intellectuals believed that liberalism has failed what they conceived of its most important (political) purpose, the need of a radical break with the communist past. Based on a study of the writings and careers of leading Polish and Hungarian right‐wing intellectuals, the article draws attention to the nature of the perceived threat to the nation. It contributes to the sociology of nationalism an analysis of how such a threat emerges and translates into a guiding idea of illiberal economic policies.","[('Mihai Varga', 'Institute for East‐European Studies Freie Universität Berlin  Berlin Germany')]","['10.1017/9781108381413', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190600389.001.0001', '10.1057/s41290-017-0045-7', '10.1146/annurev-soc-073018-022351', '10.1017/S157401961900035X', '10.1080/13563467.2019.1639146', '10.1017/CBO9781139087230', '10.1086/344411', '10.7591/9780801465666', '10.1080/01402382.2018.1511958', '10.1111/1468-4446.12325', '10.1177/0308275X7900401307', '10.1080/14782804.2018.1498771', '10.1177/0888325418791723', '10.1515/9781400850365', '10.1177/0032329211405440', '10.4324/9780203892084', '10.1080/01402389408425014', '10.1017/gov.2013.22', '10.1007/978-3-642-00560-2_11', '10.5195/jwsr.2016.626', '10.1017/CBO9780511613388', '10.1111/amet.12469', '10.1080/1356346042000190394', '10.2307/422246', '10.1080/09692290.2010.507132', '10.1111/1468-2478.00235', '10.1111/1467-9515.00157', '10.1080/09512748908718795', '10.1080/09692290.2014.919336', '10.1111/nana.12023', '10.1057/9781137075673', '10.1080/15562948.2017.1317897', '10.1080/01629778.2014.962555', '10.1332/030557309X435817', '10.1111/j.0012-155X.2005.00420.x', '10.1556/SocEc.29.2007.1.3', '10.4135/9781849209946', '10.1080/00220389508422370', '10.1016/j.polsoc.2016.10.001', '10.1353/jod.1993.0009', '10.1080/05775132.2015.1012402', '10.1111/nana.12126', '10.1353/jod.2018.0048', '10.2139/ssrn.2550496', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2007.00282.x', '10.3998/mpub.11540', '10.1093/pa/gsn048', '10.1111/1469-8219.00077', '10.1177/0958928704044623', '10.1111/j.1758-5899.2011.00146.x', '10.1080/09651560801987245', '10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131752', '10.4337/9781783476565.00012', '10.1007/978-3-319-70350-3_10', '10.1111/0020-8833.00164', '10.1177/0022185617705684', '10.1017/S0047279410000723', '10.1080/09512740802650971', '10.1177/0958928714545446', '10.1163/9789004234307', '10.1017/S0003055409990220', '10.1080/13563467.2019.1598960', '10.1215/01903659-2409703', '10.2307/3088399', '10.1080/14650045.2020.1734564', '10.1016/j.postcomstud.2018.01.008', '10.1080/13563460903287322', '10.1007/s11186-009-9092-6', '10.4324/9781315819006']",Wiley

Intellectual historians have meanwhile begun to historicize Rawls's use of contemporary philosophical resources and his engagement with economic theory. In this article I argue that what held together Rawls's evolving interest in postwar political economy and his commitment to philosophy as reconciliation was his understanding of the need for secular theodicy. In placing Rawls in the intellectual context of a postwar political economy of growth as well as in relation to the history of political thought, including his reading of that history, I defend two claims. First, I argue that Rawls's philosophical ambition is best understood as providing a secular reconciliatory theodicy. Second, I suggest that Rawls's theodicy was initially rendered plausible by the economic background conditions of economic growth that were fractured and fragmented just as Rawls's book was published in 1971. This divergence between text and context helps to account for Rawls's peculiar reception and his own subsequent attempt to insist on the applicability of his theory under radically altered circumstances.","[('Stefan Eich', '')]","['10.1017/S1479244316000159', '10.2307/j.ctvfb6z6f', '10.1080/1462317X.2016.1211287', '10.2307/1959094', '10.1515/9781400848515', '10.7208/chicago/9780226233741.001.0001', '10.2307/1597903', '10.1353/jhi.2019.0006', '10.1086/386242', '10.4159/9780674242944']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Its principal intention is to reflect on the origins, growth, and recent institutionalization of African American intellectual history while showing the relationship between those developments and broader trends within the US and, at times, European historical profession. This framework is meant as a corrective. African American intellectual history is a distinctive field with its own origins, objectives, and methods. Yet it also demands centering within US and global intellectual history.

10.1093/pastj/gtz055,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,THE DESERT AT THE END OF EMPIRE: AN ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE,[],"Abstract In the contentious historiography of the Armenian genocide, the desert has been acknowledged by almost everyone as the endpoint of the deportations of hundreds of thousands of Ottoman Armenian citizens in 1915 and the years that followed. Those who use the term ‘genocide’ suggest that this action was tantamount to a death sentence, while those who oppose the term claim that the desert exculpates the Ottoman state. This article unpacks the meaning of the Jazira region — one of the arid regions to which Armenians were sent — and suggests how Ottoman officials used the desert to kill and Armenians used it to survive, mostly as part of nomadic groups among whom they were somewhere between slaves and family members. The desert even came to shape the humanitarian rescue campaign in the wake of the genocide and World War I, as organizations worked to remove Armenian children from the desert and, subsequently, to transform the desert itself by establishing Armenian agricultural colonies. Yet some Armenians stayed, and remain to this day in the Jazira calling themselves Armenian Muslims in honor of their heritage. The desert not only shaped Armenian suffering and survival. The marginal environment also incubated a population of imperial survivors, whose existence did not fit comfortably with post-Ottoman national divisions, or the historiographies influenced by them.","[('Samuel Dolbee', 'Yale University')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

In the northern Apennines, where thrust systems are ramp-dominated and form an emergent imbricate fan, syn-kinematic sedimentation was abundant and accumulated ahead and above each thrust. In the southern Apennines, the far-travelled Lagronegro allochthon achieved its high displacements (&gt;65 km) while the foredeep basin received little sediment. The imbricate fan at the front of the main Himalayan arc developed within a foredeep that experienced high rates of syn-kinematic sedimentation. In contrast, further west, the Salt Range Thrust emerged into a distal, weakly developed foredeep with significantly reduced rates of sediment accumulation. Displacements were strongly localized onto this thrust (c. 25 km displacement) which activated an upper detachment along the syn-orogenic surface. It is an arrested thrust-allochthon. Lateral variations into the adjacent, ramp-dominated but still salt-detached, Jhelum fold-belt are marked by increases in syn-kinematic sedimentation. As sedimentation styles can vary in space and time, individual thrusts and thrust systems can evolve from being allochthon prone to imbricate dominated.","[('Robert W. H.

The purpose of this study is to explore whether global virtual team (GVT) projects raise students' understanding of cultural differences. In addition, it is interesting to know how internationally disruptive events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influence GVT projects.Design/methodology/approachThe research involved two parts: In the first part, a two-wave longitudinal study was conducted to investigate how intercultural sensitivity and intercultural communication competence coevolve within a group of international students enrolled in a virtual business professional project. In the second part, using word clouds and topic modelling on the participants' perceptions, the study investigated whether the sudden disruption caused by the pandemic show similar results in performance, focussing primarily on the resilience of virtual teams. Further, the study explored participants' perceptions towards online learning in higher education institutions as well as the attitude of corporate organizations towards remote working in the post-pandemic years.FindingsThe results confirmed that GVT projects, in fact, do raise students' understanding of cultural differences and the need to adjust their behaviour accordingly in order to engage with their culturally different counterparts effectively. Participants reported an increase in their cognitive, behavioural and affective attributes.Research limitations/implicationsAmong the limitations of this study is the relatively small number of student participants. Furthermore, the number of respondents from India dominated the sample. Since the Indian students were disproportionately affected by the shutdown, causing them to return often to rural areas with poor Internet connectivity, responses concerning the disruption caused by the pandemic may be overriding negative. The same could be said of responses from US-American students, who often rely heavily on-campus employment or whose parents became unemployed during the pandemic, and thus were faced with disproportionate economic insecurity.Practical implicationsThis paper provides insights to the educators and international organizations on how such projects provide the skills essential for reducing costs, accessing knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) across borders, maintaining flexible work schedules and arrangements, and taking advantage of multiple time zones to increase productivity.Originality/valueWhile highlighting the significance of cultural intelligence, this paper investigated how the sudden disruption caused by a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic impacts performance, focussing primarily on the resilience of virtual teams.","[('Stephanie Swartz', ''), ('Archana Shrivastava', '')]","['10.2307/249763', '10.1002/9781119221548.ch7', '10.1080/09585192.2018.1428722', '10.1080/00909889309365352', '10.5964/ijpr.v13i2.378', '10.2478/manment-2018-0032', '10.1016/0147-1767(86)90005-2', '10.1177/105256299902300302', '10.1177/2329490613514598', '10.1027/1866-5888/a000075', '10.1002/smj.4250141006', '10.1177/1028315306287002', '10.1016/j.psychsport.2012.04.007', '10.1177/1080569908325860', '10.1177/1046496406292337', '10.1016/0147-1767(77)90045-1', '10.1016/0147-1767(78)90036-6', '10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.02.014', '10.1163/9789087904753_004', '10.1016/j.hrmr.2005.01.002', '10.1108/13632541211279030', '10.15390/EB.2016.6195', '10.1111/jcc4.12029', '10.1111/1467-8624.00164', '10.5465/amp.2014.0120', '10.1287/orsc.1120.0739', '10.1037/0022-3514.59.1.38', '10.1177/105960117600100308', '10.1177/105960117700200408', '10.1016/j.appdev.2018.12.007', '10.25304/rlt.v26.2061', '10.1080/08975930.2019.1698390', '10.1080/01933922.2012.721482', '10.1177/1080569908330372', '10.1177/1050651910363266', '10.1177/1080569905285543', '10.21125/iceri.2020.0542', '10.1177/2329490619878834', '10.1007/s10608-011-9353-3', '10.1093/oso/9780190933692.003.0010', '10.5815/ijmecs.2015.06.01', '10.1177/1080569904273715', '10.1080/00909880009365581']",Emerald
10.1111/russ.12298,RUSSIAN REVIEW,0603 World History,Sexual Citizens in Exile: State-Sponsored Homophobia and Post-Soviet LGBTQI+ Migration,[],"This article presents a transnational ethnography of a Russian‐speaking LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning) community in New York City addressing the impact of state‐sponsored homophobia in Russia, particularly the 2013 “gay propaganda” ban on international queer migration. Drawing on the theorizations of Russian state‐sponsored homophobia from a perspective of sexual citizenship, the article suggests that emigration through political asylum becomes a new form of the post‐Soviet queer political subject's response to the exclusion from citizenship. Accompanied by the increase in physical and symbolic violence generated by the antigay legislation, the current configuration of sexual citizenship makes staying in Russia unbearable for some non‐heterosexual citizens prompting them to emigrate. In the United States, they attempt to find safety from systemic homophobia and access sexual citizenship rights by applying for political asylum, which is a precarious route in itself as it makes them vulnerable to the structural violence of the U.S. immigration regime. Their willingness to take this risk indicates the significance of both state‐sponsored homophobia and sexual citizenship to their lives. The article also considers another transnational effect of the “gay propaganda” law: the transformation of RUSA LBGT, a New‐York‐City‐based Russian‐speaking LGBTQ community, from a social to activist organization, due to the influx of new migrants seeking asylum in the United States. Thus, it suggests that state‐sponsored homophobia in Russia has de‐territorialized transnational effects such as stimulation of LGBTQ emigration and transformation and mobilization of diasporic communities.","[('ALEXANDRA NOVITSKAYA', ""Ph.D. candidate in Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Stony Brook University (SUNY)."")]",[],Wiley

However, the benefits of piped water can be limited in environments characterized by the inadequate storage and disposal of waste. This article studies the impact of waterworks and sewerage on mortality in German cities during the period 1877–1913. The results show that the supply of safe drinking water reduced the number of deaths, although to a lower extent than suggested previously. In the absence of efficient systems of sewage removal, contact with faeces and water contamination created a favourable environment for the spread of enteric ailments, offsetting some of the positive effects of waterworks. Moreover, the study shows that sanitary investments had important heterogeneous effects. First, their impact was markedly lower in municipalities with high levels of economic inequality and employment in the textile sector. Second, cities located in non‐Prussian territories experienced lower declines in mortality following the construction of sanitary infrastructures. The results in this article highlight the importance of analysing public health measures jointly as well as their interaction with local socioeconomic and institutional factors to understand historical progress against ill health and premature death.","[('Daniel Gallardo‐Albarrán', 'Wageningen University')]","['10.1086/700766', '10.1257/aer.p20161095', '10.1093/jeea/jvz052', '10.1017/S0022050716000413', '10.1162/003355304772839588', '10.1017/S0022050700004927', '10.1111/ehr.12573', '10.1111/ehr.12699', '10.1257/jel.53.3.503', '10.1353/dem.2005.0002', '10.2307/j.ctt3fgxbm', '10.3998/mpub.14163', '10.1017/S1361491699000131', '10.1257/jep.14.1.7', '10.1016/j.eeh.2007.06.001', '10.1016/S1473-3099(04)01253-8', '10.1017/CBO9780511975912', '10.1017/CBO9780511817649', '10.1257/app.20150431', '10.1080/01615440009598952', '10.1080/1081602X.2019.1605923', '10.1093/shm/11.1.49', '10.1017/S0268416099003550', '10.1017/S0022050700041620', '10.1016/j.jue.2016.03.001', '10.1177/036319908501000203', '10.2307/2061324', '10.1093/qje/qjq010', '10.1017/CBO9780511794841.007', '10.1111/1468-0289.00209', '10.1017/S0022050700024633', '10.1080/00324728.1975.10410201', '10.1111/1468-0297.00270', '10.7551/mitpress/7170.001.0001', '10.1093/shm/7.3.401', '10.1016/S1353-8292(99)00029-5', '10.4236/health.2013.512298']",Wiley

We have implemented a prototype verifier for a subset of Rust and confirmed the effectiveness of our method.","[('Yusuke Matsushita', ''), ('Takeshi Tsukada', ''), ('Naoki Kobayashi', '')]","['10.1016/0304-3975(91)90224-P', '10.1007/978-3-642-28717-6_7', '10.3929/ethz-b-000311092', '10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_32', '10.1145/1953122.1953145', '10.1007/978-3-319-23534-9_2', '10.1145/1040305.1040327', '10.1145/582419.582440', '10.1007/3-540-44898-5_4', '10.1007/11609773_28', '10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_20', '10.1007/978-3-030-02768-1_8', '10.1145/286936.286947', '10.1007/978-3-642-03359-9_2', '10.1145/321978.321991', '10.23919/FMCAD.2017.8102247', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_14', '10.1145/1232420.1232424', '10.1145/2254064.2254112', '10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_20', '10.1007/978-3-319-66706-5_8', '10.1145/2950290.2950330', '10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_15', '10.3929/ethz-a-010669150', '10.1145/3009837', '10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8603013', '10.2307/2268661', '10.1145/3158154', '10.1017/S0956796818000151', '10.1145/3371113', '10.1145/2676726.2676980', '10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_19', '10.14722/ndss.2018.23082', '10.1145/1993498.1993525', '10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_2', '10.1007/978-3-540-24622-0_22', '10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4', '10.1145/1065010.1065027', '10.1109/INDIN.2018.8471992', '10.1145/2663171.2663188', '10.26226/morressier.604907f41a80aac83ca25d55', '10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_26', '10.1007/978-3-662-49122-5_2', '10.1145/3294032.3294081', '10.1145/237721.237727', '10.1109/LICS.2001.932480', '10.1007/978-3-642-10672-9_11', '10.1145/1375581.1375583', '10.1109/ASE.2015.77']",Springer International Publishing

Four palaeogeographical proximal–distal transects are recognized and comprise: (i) the Cantabrian, West Asturian-Leonese, Central Iberian/Central Armorican and Ossa-Morena/North Armorican zones and domains of the Iberian and Armorican massifs, respectively; (ii) the South Armorican Domain and its lateral prolongation into the Thiviers-Payzac unit and the Occitan Domain, including the transect from the Axial, southern and northern Montagne Noire, and the Albigeois-southern Cévennes unit; (iii) the southern and northern sides of the Canigó Massif in the Eastern Pyrenees; and (iv) the External Zone and the External and Internal nappes of Sardinia. Two geodynamic scenarios are recognized controlled by the presence/absence of: (i) the Furongian–Early Ordovician (Toledanian or ‘lacaune normande’) break-up unconformity across the Ossa-Morena/North Armorican and Central Iberian/Central Armorican belts; (ii) the Early–Late Ordovician (Sardic) Phase across the Occitan and Pyrenean domains and SW Sardinia; and (iii) the migration of peaks in trilobite and cinctan (echinoderm) diversity. Other similar palaeogeographical shifts are recognized in zircon provenance patterns, the occurrence of climatically sensitive subtropical facies and mineral indicators across platform–basinal transects along the Gondwana margin. This multidisciplinary framework is proposed as a preliminary step in the quest to produce more tightly constrained Early Paleozoic reconstructions along southwestern Europe.","[('J.

Environmental Malgovernance under Bolsonaro and the Ambiguous Role of the Sustainable Development Goals",[],"Brazil has continuously been in the international spotlight, first as an emerging economy improving social inclusion and sustainable development, then suddenly as a global pariah on environmental governance. Using two case studies – the rising deforestation of the Amazon and the 2019 oil spill on Brazil's Northeast coast – we examine the Bolsonaro administration in the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, to reveal a combination of misgovernance and malgovernance, where transgressions are intentional. The article develops these analytical concepts, explores how environmental malgovernance in Brazil may be addressed and discusses how Bolsonaro's malpractices are internationally challenged, but also condoned.","[('Mairon G.

Although replicas eventually converge, they may diverge temporarily, for instance when the network fails. This makes it difficult for the developer to reason about the object’s properties, and in particular, to prove invariants over its state. For the subclass of state-based distributed systems, we propose a proof methodology for establishing that a given object maintains a given invariant, taking into account any concurrency control. Our approach allows reasoning about individual operations separately. We demonstrate that our rules are sound, and we illustrate their use with some representative examples. We automate the rule using Boogie, an SMT-based tool.","[('Sreeja S.

However, studies have shown inconsistent results with some personality traits better than the other in predicting students' performance in different academic majors. The purpose of this study is to examine the interrelation between personality traits, teamwork competencies and academic performance among first-year first semester engineering students in an Australian university located in the Sarawak state of Malaysia.Design/methodology/approachThe Individual and Team Performance (ITP) metrics were administered among 189 students to gauge their personality traits as well as self-rated and peer-rated teamwork competencies. The correlations between personality traits and teamwork competencies as well as correlations of both the variables to academic performance were subsequently analyzed.FindingsThis study shows no significant difference between the self-rated and peer-rated teamwork competencies. Adventurous trait appears to negatively correlate with teamwork competencies. This study also reveals teamwork competencies as better predictors of academic performance than personality traits. Commitment and focus show relatively larger effect on academic performance. It can be concluded that commitment is the most significant factor to excel in first-year engineering in the university. Therefore, interventions that promote commitment is crucial to academic performance of the first-year first semester engineering students.Practical implicationsThis study promulgates the development of team competencies which are more crucial to academic excellence than personalities. It is useful for the design of team learning activities which lead to the development of teamwork competencies while improving academic performance. It shows that team activities which reinforce commitment especially and focus secondarily, will have significant positive effect on academic performance of the first-year engineering students generally.Originality/valueWhile most studies in this area examine the correlation between personality traits and academic performance, this study is among the very few that looks into the aspect of teamwork competencies. This study also finds its value in its regional significance as such correlational studies are not prevalent in Malaysia.","[('Kuok Ho Daniel Tang', '')]","['10.3823/1781', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199861378.003.0012', '10.1037/a0016229', '10.1177/0308022617691539', '10.1006/ceps.2001.1094', '10.1080/03055698.2013.825577', '10.1016/j.lindif.2009.10.002', '10.1037/1040-3590.17.2.123', '10.1037/a0021212', '10.1111/j.1468-2389.2007.00371.x', '10.1002/jhrm.21233', '10.1097/ACM.0000000000001670', '10.1080/02699939208409696', '10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.257', '10.1097/PCC.0000000000001025', '10.1016/S0092-6566(03)00046-1', '10.2190/C0T7-YX50-F71V-00CW', '10.1016/B978-0-12-374946-8.10008-1', '10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.01.055', '10.1016/S0191-8869(98)00245-1', '10.1023/A:1007714801558', '10.1016/j.paid.2016.12.021', '10.1037/amp0000295', '10.1111/apps.12207', '10.1080/10511253.2012.679362', '10.1016/j.jrp.2013.06.003', '10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190127', '10.1080/02602938.2018.1526256', '10.1016/j.colegn.2014.05.001', '10.1037/0022-3514.84.4.890', '10.1037/0022-3514.81.3.524', '10.1037/0022-3514.82.4.469', '10.5465/amle.2014.0124', '10.1037/pspp0000089', '10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00047.x', '10.1037/amp0000298', '10.1016/j.paid.2007.01.006', '10.1016/j.lindif.2010.11.026', '10.1007/s11165-016-9602-2', '10.1108/IJSHE-08-2017-0139', '10.1002/job.680', '10.1037/0022-3514.84.1.165', '10.1016/j.paid.2015.12.011', '10.1037/a0017908', '10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00280.x', '10.1037/a0013314', '10.1016/j.jrp.2006.03.001', '10.1080/03075079.2015.1034258']",Emerald

10.1111/hith.12269,HISTORY AND THEORY,0603 World History,PREDICTIONS WITHOUT FUTURES,[],"ABSTRACTModernity held sacred the aspirational formula of the open future: a promise of human determination that doubles as an injunction to control. Today, the banner of this plannable future is borne by technology. Allegedly impersonal, neutral, and exempt from disillusionment with ideology, belief in technological change saturates the present horizon of historical futures. Yet I argue that this is exactly how today's technofutures enact a hegemony of closure and sameness. In particular, the growing emphasis on prediction as AI's skeleton key to all social problems constitutes what religious studies calls cosmograms: universalizing models that govern how facts and values relate to each other, providing a common and normative point of reference. In a predictive paradigm, social problems are made conceivable only as objects of calculative control—control that can never be fulfilled but that persists as an eternally deferred and recycled horizon. I show how this technofuture is maintained not so much by producing literally accurate predictions of future events but through ritualized demonstrations of predictive time.","[('Sun‐ha Hong', 'Simon Fraser University')]",[],Wiley

In Brazil, indigenous, Afro‐Brazilian quilombolas and other racialised communities have suffered disproportionately under Bolsonaro's hands‐off policy during the pandemic. We argue that, far from happenstance, this policy fits into a form of necropolitics towards forest peoples. Drawing from Achille Mbembe's seminal work, this article analyses how underlying (and sometimes overt) racism, cultural depredation, and government‐supported deforestation constitute an assault now catalysed by the pandemic. Understanding forest peoples' disproportionate deaths in perspective is critical for addressing their growing vulnerability and the broader politics currently at play.","[('Gabriela Russo Lopes', 'CEDLA University of Amsterdam  The Netherlands'), ('Mairon G Bastos Lima', 'Chalmers University of Technology  Sweden')]","['10.1007/s10729-020-09505-5', '10.1590/1809-4422asoc20200123vu2020l3id', '10.5209/geop.69349', '10.1017/S0376892919000213', '10.1215/08992363-15-1-11', '10.1215/9781478007227']",Wiley

Before the early 1990s, the diet of most Chileans was poor in animal proteins and calcium. Today, Chileans enjoy a diet characterized by high consumption of meat and dairy products. The rapid rise in consumption of these products can be attributed to various factors: Chile belatedly joining the international agribusiness revolution; government support from the 1930s to the 1960s; increasing GDP per capita; macro-economic stability; changes in consumption habits; trade liberalization; and the fall in food prices, as both meat and milk had high income elasticity. These revolutions in both production and consumption have greatly improved the nutrition of the Chilean population and partly explain the improvement in Chile’s biological well-being.","[('Manuel Llorca-Jaña', 'Universidad de Valparaíso'), ('Ricardo Nazer', 'Universidad de Valparaíso'), ('Daniel Morales', 'Universidad de Valparaíso'), ('Juan Navarrete-Montalvo', 'Universidad de Valparaíso')]","['10.1007/978-1-4615-0811-3_1', '10.1079/phn2001283', '10.7440/histcrit62.2016.06', '10.1093/ereh/heu003', '10.1353/tech.2001.0150', '10.1016/j.endeavour.2009.04.008', '10.37801/ajad2007.4.2.5', '10.3098/ah.2010.84.2.176', '10.1080/00076791.2016.1155558', '10.1111/joac.12291', '10.1111/ehr.12702', '10.3945/ajcn.114.084764', '10.1111/j.1467-9523.1989.tb00360.x', '10.4067/s0717-71942017000100003', '10.1006/jhge.1995.0018', '10.1080/07373938908916590', '10.20506/rst.16.2.1037', '10.4067/s0718-10432018005001602', '10.1016/j.ehb.2018.03.004', '10.1017/s0212610918000198', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729937.013.0021', '10.4067/s0717-71942018000200455', '10.4324/9780203444894', '10.2307/2938388', '10.1111/j.1753-4887.2004.tb00084.x', '10.2307/1349725', '10.1484/m.rurhe-eb.4.00169', '10.4067/s0718-16202014000300005', '10.1017/s1368980000000070', '10.1093/tcbh/hwr010', '10.18232/alhe.955']",Historia Agraria
10.1108/HESWBL-05-2020-0112,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,Investigating work-integrated learning and its relevance to skills development in degree apprenticeships,[],"PurposePrevious research suggests that higher education provision, the government's knowledge-based economic agenda and the attributes employers look for in graduates are not always aligned, leading to a skill shortage and the production of graduates who are not “work ready”. Degree apprenticeships (DAs) are well placed to address this gap because employers are involved in both the design and delivery of higher education and work with higher education institutions (HEIs) to develop the skills both parties believe graduates need through work-integrated learning (WIL). This paper will address how DAs can be utilised to that purpose.Design/methodology/approachThis paper draws on data collected from students, ranging from their first to final years, enrolled in the Chartered Manager Degree Apprenticeship (CMDA) programme at a higher education provider in London, UK. The national context of the UK is crucial both because of how DAs have been introduced by the government; how the pedagogical implications defer from other national contexts and work based provision and also because there are clear contrasts in how the private and public sector in the UK are “using” degree apprentices. The authors adopted an exploratory research design using semi-structured interviews and focus groups.FindingsThe authors argue that a reflective approach in assessed coursework, in conjunction with an explicit focus on the skill development of students, can enhance the experience of degree apprentices completing WIL modules. The authors highlight the potential of WIL modules in advancing the ability of degree apprentices to reflect on their practice while they are working and studying, a process which can have long- term benefits to their professional identity. The authors draw attention to the affordances given to apprentices to develop their professional identity drawing comparisons between the public and private sector in the UK.Originality/valueThis paper adds to the work on DAs and WIL currently being undertaken in the UK. By exploring the case study of a cohort of DAs engaging in productive reflection with regards to the skills they develop at the workplace and in the classroom, the authors point to a way in which module development can integrate such reflective elements.","[('Iro Konstantinou', ''), ('Elizabeth Miller', '')]","['10.1080/02602938.2019.1639613', '10.1177/1028315307303542', '10.1080/02602930600679050', '10.1108/HESWBL-06-2016-0038', '10.1108/ET-10-2015-0091', '10.1080/03098260600927575', '10.1080/13636820.2016.1143866', '10.1080/03054980701782098', '10.1002/berj.3218', '10.1080/13639080600776870', '10.1080/0309877X.2012.699516', '10.1080/14681369900200057', '10.1177/1077800407301175', '10.1080/13636829800200043', '10.1093/oep/gpq002', '10.1080/13583883.2000.9967007', '10.1108/JWAM-10-2015-003', '10.1177/0891241604266988', '10.1177/1468794106058866', '10.1093/oep/gpv070', '10.1177/1609406917733847', '10.1080/02680930500108718', '10.3138/9781442686410-016', '10.1162/0011526054622015', '10.1002/berj.3222']",Emerald

In deeply buried reservoirs, chlorite coats on sand grains prevent the growth of quartz cements and lead to anomalously good reservoir quality. By contrast, an excess of chlorite – for example, in clay-rich siltstone and sandstone – leads to blocked pore throats and very low permeability. Determining which compositional type is present, how it occurs spatially, and quantifying the many and varied habits of chlorite that are of commercial importance remains a challenge. With the advent of automated techniques based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM), it is possible to provide instant phase identification and mapping of entire thin sections of rock. The resulting quantitative mineralogy and rock fabric data can be compared with well logs and core analysis data. We present here a completely novel Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by SCANning electron microscopy (QEMSCAN®) SEM–energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) methodology to differentiate, quantify and image 11 different compositional types of chlorite based on Fe : Mg ratios using thin sections of rocks and grain mounts of cuttings or loose sediment. No other analytical technique, or combination of techniques, is capable of easily quantifying and imaging different compositional types of chlorite. Here we present examples of chlorite from seven different geological settings analysed using QEMSCAN® SEM–EDS. By illustrating the reliability of identification under automated analysis, and the ability to capture realistic textures in a fully digital format, we can clearly visualize the various forms of chlorite. This new approach has led to the creation of a digital chlorite library, in which we have co-registered optical and SEM-based images, and validated the mineral identification with complimentary techniques such as X-ray diffraction. This new methodology will be of interest and use to all those concerned with the identification and formation of chlorite in sandstones and the effects that diagenetic chlorite growth may have had on reservoir quality. The same approach may be adopted for other minerals (e.g. carbonates) with major element compositional variability that may influence the porosity and permeability of sandstone reservoirs.","[('R. H.

Extensional fault-propagation folding, rotation and uplift produced gravitationally driven scarp collapse of the incompetent and mudstone-dominated uppermost Mungaroo Formation. Scarp degradation occurred along the entire extent of the footwalls of three major faults within the research area. Individual segments display listric fault surfaces in cross-section and scoop-shaped scars in three dimensions. The listric collapse faults dip towards the erosional scarp and sole out at different levels within the upper Triassic Mungaroo Formation. Footwall crestal collapse formed coalesced, scoop-shaped degradation scarps with Mungaroo Formation debris deposited as wedges within the adjacent hanging-wall synclines. Maximum scarp degradation occurred at the fault centres and decreased towards the fault tips.

Over the last decades, these spores have become increasingly important as a proxy to study the Pleistocene and Holocene megafauna. Although the number of types used in palaeoecology is relatively small, there is a wide range of coprophilous fungal taxa whose utility in palaeoenvironmental reconstruction remains under-researched. However, environmental and taphonomic factors influencing preservation and recovery of these spores are still poorly understood. Furthermore, our understanding of whether and how spores are transported across the landscape is limited. Dung fungal spore presence appears to correlate well with megaherbivore presence. However, depending on the site, some limitations can remain to quantitative reconstructions of megaherbivore abundance from dung fungal spore records. The presence of dung fungal spores is often more significant than their absence and variation in abundance with time should be interpreted with caution. Correlation with other proxies may provide a promising way forward. The majority of studies using dung fungal spores as an indicator for large herbivore abundance are of records of Late Pleistocene and Holocene age, with a focus on Late Quaternary megafaunal extinction. However, more research could potentially extend records further back in time.","[('Eline N. van Asperen', 'School of History, Classics and Archaeology, Newcastle University, UK'), ('Angelina

10.1017/S0021853721000566,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN HISTORY,0603 World History,"Another World? East Africa, Decolonisation, and the Global History of the Mid-Twentieth Century",[],"AbstractThis article proposes that there is a gap in our current understanding of the globalising and deglobalising dynamics of mid-twentieth-century East Africa, one that might be addressed by consolidating and taking forward recent developments in the historiography of decolonisation. Recent work by international historians has recovered the connected world of the 1940s to 1960s: the era of new postcolonial states, the ‘Bandung moment’, pan-African cooperation, and the early Cold War. Yet East Africa is less prominent in these histories than we might expect, despite the vibrancy of current work on this period in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. Bringing these two fields into dialogue, through an explicitly regional East African framework and with a particular focus on individual lives, expands our understanding not only of the ‘globalisation of decolonisation’ but also of the deglobalising dynamics of the following decades that are frequently reduced to a history of global economic crisis.","[('Ismay Milford', ''), ('Gerard McCann', ''), ('Emma Hunter', ''), ('Daniel Branch', '')]","['10.1215/00267929-2920051', '10.1080/09592290108406215', '10.1080/17531055.2012.755314', '10.1017/S1740022817000262', '10.56279/TZA20210922', '10.1111/nana.12448', '10.1017/S0021853712000230', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199899142.001.0001', '10.1017/9781316659083', '10.2307/j.ctt6wpmb1', '10.1017/S0018246X18000407', '10.2307/2168387', '10.2979/transition.106a.12', '10.1080/14662047208447155', '10.5040/9781350051829', '10.1093/ahr/123.3.728', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198713197.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9781316221679', '10.2307/j.ctv224txv2', '10.1093/jsh/shz101', '10.1017/9781316946350', '10.1017/S0020859000113859', '10.1215/9780822372325', '10.1017/S0018246X19000712', '10.1080/13696815.2019.1635437', '10.1017/CBO9781139032544', '10.2307/j.ctv21ptt61', '10.1080/17531055.2015.1091639', '10.2307/3097615', '10.1017/CBO9781316104620', '10.1017/S0021853708003915', '10.1353/mod.2006.0061', '10.1017/9781139028769', '10.1080/09555803.2019.1646785', '10.1093/jsh/shz098', '10.1093/ahr/rhy577', '10.2307/j.ctv224tszp']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)
10.1108/HESWBL-02-2022-0031,HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING,0603 World History; 0401 Education,A bibliometric review of research on employability: dataset from Scopus between 1972 and 2019,[],"PurposeEmployability has long been a concern of scholars because of its complicated nature and changes in the requirements in labor markets to meet the new requirements of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and globalization. However, there has not yet been much systematic investigation of the existing literature tracing the trends, changes and developments in employability research. This paper aims to fill this void by analyzing data obtained from the Scopus dataset from 1972 to 2019.Design/methodology/approachA total of 1,703 Scopus-indexed articles were filtered from 7,885 documents. The results reflect a rapidly emerging literature on employability, given the worldwide interest in this topic. Using descriptive statistics and bibliometric analyses, the review identified trends in employability research, whose impact has been sustained for several decades.FindingsWith science mapping, the conceptual structure of scientific disciplines was visualized, highlighting three main schools of thought including employers’ requirements and higher education institutions’ preparation; the antecedents of employability; and the role of work-integrated learning in enhancing employability.Originality/valueThe paper calls for more integrative research focusing on personal agency with the development of career paths inside organizations as well as for a more focus on a multilevel perspective exploring both individuals' and organizations’ perceptions.","[('Ngoan Thi Dinh', ''), ('Luong Dinh Hai', ''), ('Hiep-Hung Pham', '')]","['10.3390/SU12155900', '10.1111/apps.12082', '10.4102/sajip.v44i0.1503', '10.1504/IJEBR.2019.096582', '10.1080/15623599.2021.1995807', '10.1108/CDI-08-2016-0135', '10.1080/01425692.2013.838415', '10.1007/s10551-019-04140-9', '10.1108/ET-06-2016-0100', '10.3390/educsci12040255', '10.1108/IJEM-05-2016-0122', '10.1016/j.jvb.2019.02.013', '10.1177/1059601115617086', '10.1108/CDI-12-2014-0162', '10.1080/07294360802444347', '10.21153/jtlge2019vol10no1art785', '10.1016/j.ijme.2015.07.002', '10.1108/ET-06-2016-0111', '10.1177/1469787415574050', '10.1007/s10734-014-9760-y', '10.1016/j.jvb.2011.05.010', '10.1177/0894845314533420', '10.1002/job.1996', '10.1016/j.bar.2006.08.003', '10.1002/job.214', '10.1080/03075079.2015.1101754', '10.1016/j.jvb.2015.04.007', '10.1111/1748-8583.12206', '10.1080/02680939.2016.1268271', '10.1007/s12186-015-9131-6', '10.1080/09585192.2014.971846', '10.1108/CDI-06-2017-0098', '10.1108/HESWBL-12-2017-0102', '10.1007/s10775-015-9288-4', '10.3390/su11082401', '10.3102/0034654319830380', '10.3390/su12051947', '10.21153/jtlge2019vol10no2art827', '10.1108/HESWBL-04-2015-0015', '10.1039/C8RP00105G', '10.1080/00221341.2015.1085588', '10.1016/j.econedurev.2015.07.001', '10.1108/ET-08-2014-0093', '10.1080/03075079.2013.842221', '10.1080/07294360.2016.1139551', '10.1007/s10734-016-0080-2', '10.1007/s10734-017-0216-z', '10.1080/13562517.2015.1136281', '10.1080/07294360.2016.1229270', '10.1080/03075079.2013.842210', '10.1057/s41262-018-0117-1', '10.1007/s10798-015-9319-y', '10.1016/j.brq.2016.02.001', '10.1108/CDI-04-2015-0056', '10.24191/ajue.v15i3.7803', '10.1007/978-3-319-66954-0', '10.11591/ijere.v11i1.22145', '10.1177/0950422216663719', '10.1177/1477878515598060', '10.1108/ET-02-2014-0017', '10.22452/mojem/vol8no1.1', '10.5267/j.msl.2019.10.005', '10.7326/0003-4819-151-4-200908180-00135', '10.1007/s11192-015-1765-5', '10.1007/s10734-019-00372-w', '10.17015/ejbe.2021.028.03', '10.1080/07294360.2018.1446415', '10.1108/HESWBL-04-2018-0049', '10.1080/08832323.2018.1545629', '10.1007/s11192-021-03965-4', '10.1080/02673843.2016.1234401', '10.1016/j.jvb.2017.01.005', '10.1080/1360080X.2015.1126896', '10.1108/00400910710754435', '10.1016/j.jvb.2015.01.001', '10.1007/s12186-011-9072-7', '10.1177/00220574211016444', '10.1108/HESWBL-02-2015-0005', '10.1057/978-1-137-57168-7_2', '10.1016/j.jvb.2007.12.001', '10.1007/s10734-015-9903-9', '10.1080/03075079.2014.977859', '10.36253/978-88-5518-155-6.09', '10.2991/assehr.k.200813.009', '10.1108/ET-07-2018-0154', '10.1057/hep.2011.26', '10.1108/ET-05-2016-0090', '10.1080/13639080.2014.900167', '10.1080/00071005.2015.1128526', '10.1080/13562517.2016.1198761', '10.1080/03075079.2019.1602757', '10.1080/13594320344000237', '10.1080/1359432X.2015.1007130', '10.1007/978-3-319-10377-8_13', '10.1108/ET-03-2017-0037', '10.1108/PR-05-2014-0100', '10.1080/13639080.2015.1102210', '10.1177/1094428114562629']",Emerald

This often limits the application of verification techniques, as writing formal specifications is an error-prone and time-consuming manual task. To facilitate this, we present , a framework for applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive formal specifications (in temporal logics) from unstructured natural language. In particular, we introduce a new methodology to detect and resolve the inherent ambiguity of system requirements in natural language: we utilize LLMs to map subformulas of the formalization back to the corresponding natural language fragments of the input. Users iteratively add, delete, and edit these sub-translations to amend erroneous formalizations, which is easier than manually redrafting the entire formalization.

It examines the interaction between labour demand and supply to gauge their relative importance in determining female labour force participation rates (LFPRs). Three main findings emerge from the current article. First, there is an unmistakable link between labour demand and female LFPRs. High levels of female labour force participation are found in areas where there were industries with ample demand for female labour. Second, supply‐side factors also had clear effects on female LFPRs. However, they can only operate within the limit imposed by the demand‐side conditions. Third, female migration did not fundamentally change the spatial patterns of female LFPRs. Overall, this article argues that the demand side of the female labour market was the most important factor in determining female LFPRs in nineteenth‐century England and Wales.","[('Xuesheng You', 'Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure University of Cambridge')]","['10.1093/oso/9780198805830.001.0001', '10.1080/13545701.2012.725942', '10.1093/past/143.1.167', '10.1017/S1361491697000099', '10.1111/1468-0289.00075', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2004.00292.x', '10.1017/CBO9780511495779', '10.1111/j.1467-9957.1949.tb00900.x', '10.1016/j.eeh.2018.09.003', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198204008.001.0001', '10.1086/451941', '10.2307/2172821', '10.1017/S0268416000003908', '10.1016/0014-4983(79)90010-X', '10.12987/yale/9780300151800.001.0001', '10.1093/hwj/23.1.59', '10.2307/2598131', '10.1093/hwj/dbw001', '10.2307/2597872', '10.1017/S0020859000114786', '10.1017/CBO9780511780455', '10.1080/13545701.2012.746465', '10.1017/CBO9780511522659', '10.1017/S0022050705050011', '10.1080/1081602X.2014.968181', '10.4324/9780203401958', '10.1177/036319909702200402', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2008.00459.x', '10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02221.x', '10.1080/03071028808567710', '10.4324/9780203167991', '10.1093/oso/9780195039573.001.0001', '10.1080/03071028608567640', '10.2307/2598407', '10.1017/CBO9780511599446', '10.2307/2598447', '10.1515/9781846151507', '10.1017/CBO9780511818196', '10.1515/9781782040071', '10.3366/hac.1998.10.1-3.17']",Wiley

In this paper, I establish that ethnonationalism—a set of beliefs concerning what it means to be a “true” American—was also a significant factor in the estimations of White Americans when casting their vote for president in 2016. Data from a nationally representative sample of White Americans show that ethnonationalism was a robust predictor of vote choice for Trump even after controlling for predictors known to shape vote choice, including economic assessments, sexist attitudes, racial resentment, status threat, and sociodemographic indicators. These results indicate that ethnonationalism, although correlated with some of these factors, operated primarily as an independent factor that shaped White vote choice. The findings have important implications concerning the electoral activation of White majorities concerned about the perceived threat that demographic change poses to American national identity.","[('Jack Thompson', 'Doctoral School Nottingham Trent University Nottingham UK')]","['10.1177/0002716218811309', '10.2307/2131064', '10.2307/2111651', '10.2307/2669291', '10.1111/1468-4446.12325', '10.1007/s11109-018-9446-8', '10.2307/2131685', '10.1093/oso/9780195137422.003.0004', '10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001', '10.2307/2580627', '10.1037/a0035403', '10.1111/j.1468-5906.2008.00423.x', '10.1111/0162-895X.00281', '10.1017/S1049096518000367', '10.1002/9781118900772.etrds0155', '10.1016/j.electstud.2009.05.021', '10.1017/9781108645157', '10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00564.x', '10.1017/S0021875899006180', '10.1111/ssqu.12547', '10.1177/1368430216677304', '10.15195/v5.a10', '10.1073/pnas.1718155115', '10.1017/9781108595841', '10.1177/1368430217741203', '10.1002/polq.12737', '10.1353/jod.2017.0022', '10.4324/9780203876558', '10.2979/chiricu.1.2.27', '10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00577.x', '10.7208/chicago/9780226353159.001.0001', '10.1093/poq/nfy003', '10.1093/socrel/srx070']",Wiley

We show that nationalism is crucial to both, the interpretation of Weber’s Protestant Ethic and empirical tests thereof. For late nineteenth-century century Prussia we reject Weber’s suggestion that Protestantism mattered due to an “ascetic compulsion to save.” Moreover, we find that income levels, savings, and literacy rates differed between Germans and Poles, not between Protestants and Catholics, using pooled OLS and IV regressions. We suggest that this result is due to anti-Polish discrimination.","[('Felix Kersting', ''), ('Iris Wohnsiedler', ''), ('Nikolaus Wolf', '')]","['10.1162/REST_a_00139', '10.1353/sof.2001.0096', '10.1016/j.jebo.2017.01.011', '10.2307/1387685', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199276561.001.0001', '10.1080/01615440.2013.852370', '10.1017/S0022050719000378', '10.1093/qje/qjr002', '10.1080/13668250500488827', '10.1007/978-3-642-86088-1', '10.1111/j.1468-0297.2012.02495.x', '10.29173/cjs6385', '10.1093/jeea/jvx052', '10.1086/701682', '10.2307/1519761', '10.13109/9783666370304', '10.1093/oso/9780195056112.001.0001', '10.1162/REST_a_00368', '10.1162/qjec.2008.123.2.747', '10.1016/j.eeh.2016.07.007', '10.1111/jeea.12123', '10.1177/1536867X20953572', '10.1177/14687950122232495', '10.1111/ajps.12328', '10.1162/qjec.2008.123.3.905', '10.2139/ssrn.3449578', '10.1017/S0022050707000125', '10.1162/qjec.2009.124.2.531', '10.1111/jeea.12117', '10.1016/j.jdeveco.2019.102429', '10.1093/qje/qjy011', '10.17433/978-3-17-023206-8', '10.1257/aer.96.5.1652', '10.1017/S0022050701028042', '10.1086/421167', '10.1017/S0022050709001144']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Monitoring cracks opening on concrete bridges is a key aspect for structural health assessment. Digital image processing, combined with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and photogrammetry, allows for non-contact 3D reconstruction of cracks, reducing costs and potential unsafe factors involved in manual inspections. This paper presents a flexible procedure based on UAV photogrammetry for accurate evaluation of cracks geometry, that can be implemented for periodic structural monitoring. Stereo-pair of images, acquired with UAVs close to the cracked surface, are used to build a scaled photogrammetric model through Structure-from-Motion. Cracks are detected on images by image binarization and digital image processing techniques. Thereafter, one single image is used to reconstruct crack 3D geometry, by back-projecting crack image coordinates on a 3D model of the object. This can be built from the current stereo-pair of images, or based on an existing photogrammetric model, in the case of a periodic monitoring set-up. Crack width is accurately estimated in 3D world. The procedure is tested and evaluated in a case study, obtaining millimetric accurate results, which is in line with the average ground sample distance of the images employed. Results highlight the potentials of UAVs and photogrammetry not only for bridge inspections and damages localization, but also for accurately evaluating cracks geometry and helping structural engineers to assess structure health conditions.","[('F.

Pelagic sediments from the Cretaceous greenhouse climate phase provide a valuable archive for sea-level change. Although sea-level variations are of negligible amplitude compared with depositional water-depths, direct physical proxy data are based on higher and coarser siliciclastic input during sea-level lowstand and regressions, and include coarser grain size and grain-size parameters as well as the heavy mineral and clay content. Chemical proxies that relate to siliciclastics are manganese, titanium and zirconium, often normalized v. aluminium. Further proxies provide the ratios of strontium v. calcium, controlled by shelf carbonate erosion, and partly redox-sensitive elements like uranium and thorium. From a mineralogical point of view, the total amount of siliciclastics and their diversity relating to heavy minerals provides sea-level information in hemipelagites, as well as the phyllosilicate content v. biogenic pelagic background deposition of carbonate and siliceous microfossils in pelagites. In addition, measurements of gamma ray emission, linked to U, Th, K content and magnetic susceptibility may relate to sea-level cycles and various other more climate-dependent proxies like oxygen isotopes of fossil calcite and compositional maturity of hemipelagic sediments.","[('Michael Wagreich', ''), ('Veronika Koukal', '')]","['10.1144/jgs2013-015', '10.2110/sedred.2018.4.4', '10.1016/j.epsl.2011.06.029', '10.1126/science.1148777', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.09.003', '10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.03.004', '10.1016/0025-3227(93)90150-T', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.09.017', '10.1002/2013EF000188', '10.1007/978-3-642-85916-8', '10.1016/j.jseaes.2013.04.017', '10.18814/epiiugs/2013/v36i3/002', '10.1130/G31081.1', '10.5194/cp-10-1001-2014', '10.1016/j.gr.2015.02.022', '10.1016/j.epsl.2013.12.024', '10.1016/j.cretres.2015.11.009', '10.1016/j.cretres.2015.04.010', '10.1146/annurev.ea.14.050186.002031', '10.1016/j.epsl.2011.04.024', '10.1016/j.cretres.2011.12.005', '10.1130/G32701.1', '10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.01.003', '10.1086/607150', '10.1002/9781444304015.ch6', '10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.12.007', '10.1126/science.235.4793.1156', '10.5194/cp-8-1323-2012', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.09.008', '10.1007/s00531-018-1670-2', '10.1126/science.194.4270.1121', '10.1016/B978-0-444-53000-4.00005-6', '10.1130/B30934.1', '10.1016/bs.sats.2018.08.004', '10.1016/B978-0-444-59425-9.00004-4', '10.29041/strat.04.2.17', '10.1016/j.cretres.2004.11.011', '10.1016/j.palaeo.2005.10.003', '10.1016/bs.sats.2018.08.005', '10.1016/B978-0-444-53000-4.00004-4', '10.1016/j.epsl.2010.06.027', '10.1038/ncomms15532', '10.1144/jgs.158.4.685', '10.1002/dep2.6', '10.2475/ajs.301.2.112', '10.1073/pnas.1800891115', '10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.05.036', '10.1130/G131A.1', '10.1016/0037-0738(95)00052-6', '10.1144/jgs.157.2.447', '10.1038/s41467-018-03454-y', '10.1016/j.epsl.2008.03.021', '10.1038/nature21402', '10.1130/G34510.1', '10.1016/bs.sats.2018.08.002', '10.1016/B978-0-444-59425-9.00007-X', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.11.015', '10.1029/2012PA002286', '10.1029/90JB02015', '10.1130/0091-7613(2003)031<0585:LCCOLR>2.0.CO;2', '10.1126/science.1116412', '10.5670/oceanog.2011.26', '10.1111/sed.12437', '10.2110/sepmsp.091.199', '10.1016/j.chemgeo.2015.11.023', '10.2110/sepmsp.091.137', '10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.06.018', '10.1038/ngeo1875', '10.1016/j.epsl.2005.03.015', '10.1016/j.jspi.2015.10.006', '10.1029/93RG03257', '10.1016/0037-0738(95)00060-7', '10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.08.026', '10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.10.045', '10.2110/jsr.2013.77', '10.2110/csp.05.08', '10.12789/geocanj.2015.42.070', '10.1038/215015a0', '10.1007/978-1-4899-5016-1_22', '10.1016/0277-3791(87)90003-5', '10.1038/35038000', '10.1073/pnas.1810141115', '10.1144/GSL.SP.1998.129.01.19', '10.1016/j.gca.2004.02.018', '10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.03.033', '10.1016/j.gr.2016.11.002', '10.1127/0078-0421/2012/0016', '10.2110/sepmsp.091.073', '10.1016/j.cretres.2012.04.006', '10.1016/j.sedgeo.2010.06.025', '10.1126/science.aad2622', '10.1016/B978-0-444-53000-4.00011-1', '10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.08.029', '10.1127/0078-0421/2014/0038', '10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.08.014', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2010.02.001', '10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.12.048', '10.1016/j.quaint.2017.12.038', '10.1146/annurev-earth-042711-105521']",Geological Society of London

The data was analysed using Partial Least Squares regression.FindingsEducation and employed teaching methods, in particular, positively affect students' attitudes towards entrepreneurship, their perceived capability to start a business and indirectly influence entrepreneurial intentions. However, attendance of entrepreneurship-related courses itself does not enhance perceived control and has no significant effect on personal attitudes. The study also shows that cultural context has a positive influence on students' attitudes towards entrepreneurship and, therefore, indirectly impacts their intentions to become entrepreneurs.Research limitations/implicationsFirstly, the students participating in the study were from one country. And secondly, the paper deals with pre-educational entrepreneurial intentions.Practical implicationsThe study suggests that a practice-based approach to entrepreneurship education is a key to raising entrepreneurial awareness of young people in countries whose national cultures are built on collectivist values.Originality/valueThe results of the study are of value for teaching staff, who can actually influence students' entrepreneurial self-awareness, and for university management in the context of contemporary education reforms and the latest requirements to education process.","[('Olena Mykolenko', ''), ('Inna Ippolitova', ''), ('Hanna Doroshenko', ''), ('Svitlana Strapchuk', '')]","['10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T', '10.1080/08870446.2011.613995', '10.1080/14632440110094632', '10.1057/jibs.2013.15', '10.1108/00400911211244678', '10.1016/j.jbusres.2006.12.016', '10.1080/19186444.2018.1507877', '10.1111/jsbm.12065', '10.1108/00400910210449231', '10.1007/s11747-014-0403-8', '10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00396.x', '10.1177/1465750316648576', '10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00033-0', '10.1007/s11365-005-6674-2', '10.1080/08985620903233929', '10.1111/1467-9310.00288', '10.1111/j.1540-6520.2009.00304.x', '10.1016/j.iedeen.2017.01.001', '10.1787/d7e3878d-en', '10.1016/j.euroecorev.2009.08.002', '10.1007/s10843-010-0071-9', '10.1111/jsbm.12025', '10.5465/amle.9.2.zqr169', '10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.240', '10.7814/jeen5v5p3wd', '10.1007/s11365-012-0246-z']",Emerald
10.1093/ehr/ceab166,ENGLISH HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,"The Nationalisation of British History: Historians, Nationalism and the Myths of 1940",[],"Abstract Neither the idea that Britain ‘stood alone’ in 1940, nor that the British war was a ‘people’s war’, were at all common during the Second World War. If anything was thought to be ‘alone’, it was the empire, though the more common view was that the empire always had allies. ‘People’s war’ was a rare synonym for ‘total war’ and was sometimes used in an internationalist sense of a war of many peoples, and as the sort of war Britain should be, but was not, fighting. However, from 1945 a national ‘alone’ came into usage, for example by Churchill; but only from the 1960s was it a commonplace in history books. ‘People’s war’ became more widely used in histories written in the 1960s, which defined it in a national progressive sense, although the term did not become common until the 1990s. Both ideas were essentially the creations of historians, who nationalised the history of what was an imperial and internationalist war, often turning it into a radically different domestic story focused on a national Home Front (ignoring the many imperial home fronts), a story which marginalised the military, foreign and political history of the war, and indeed the social history of the military as well. Historians later assumed that ‘alone’ and ‘people’s war’ represented wartime nationalist ideologies, and wrote about them critically. Yet until recently they did not recognise that it was the very particular nature of the histories written in the 1960s which had generated these terms, and which embodied very particular analyses of British history and of the Second World War. The paper ends by arguing that much greater understanding is needed of the core assumptions which lie beneath the historiography of twentieth-century Britain.","[('David Edgerton', 'King’s College London, UK')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

We employ a robust methodology to estimate the value of in-kind compensation, and show it to constitute a central part of the labor contract, far exceeding subsistence requirements. Patient admissions records are used to measure nurse productivity, which did not differ across genders. Female compensation varied between 70 percent and 100 percent of male levels, with fluctuations clearly linked to relative labor scarcity. Contrary to common assumptions in the literature, we show that markets played an important role in setting female compensation in early modern Castile. The sources of the gender disparity are, therefore, likely to be found in the broader social and cultural context.","[('Mauricio Drelichman', ''), ('David González Agudo', '')]","['10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00500.x', '10.1016/j.eeh.2014.08.001', '10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00665.x', '10.3886/E117426V2', '10.1257/aer.104.4.1091', '10.1006/exeh.2001.0775', '10.1017/ssh.2019.2', '10.1080/13545701.2012.746465', '10.19053/978-958-660-293-8', '10.4159/harvard.9780674332157', '10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115329', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2012.00663.x', '10.1017/CBO9780511818196', '10.1017/CBO9780511495779', '10.1111/1468-0262.00377', '10.1007/978-3-319-96962-6', '10.1017/S0022050715000662', '10.2307/2598255', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00642.x', '10.1017/S0022050700079195', '10.1111/ehr.12491', '10.1017/S1361491609002408', '10.1017/CBO9780511897979', '10.1111/1468-0289.00054', '10.1017/S0212610915000282']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

These systems shall be formally guaranteed to be trustworthy when applied to safety-critical domains, which is typically achieved by formal verification performed after training. This train-then-verify process has two limits: (i) trained systems are difficult to formally verify due to their continuous and infinite state space and inexplicable AI components (i.e., deep neural networks), and (ii) the ex post facto detection of bugs increases both the time- and money-wise cost of training and deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel verification-in-the-loop training framework called Trainify for developing safe DRL systems driven by counterexample-guided abstraction and refinement. Specifically, Trainify trains a DRL system on a finite set of coarsely abstracted but efficiently verifiable state spaces. When verification fails, we refine the abstraction based on returned counterexamples and train again on the finer abstract states. The process is iterated until all predefined properties are verified against the trained system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on six classic control systems. The experimental results show that our framework yields more reliable DRL systems with provable guarantees without sacrificing system performance such as cumulative reward and robustness than conventional DRL approaches.","[('Peng Jin', ''), ('Jiaxu Tian', ''), ('Dapeng Zhi', ''), ('Xuejun Wen', ''), ('Min Zhang', '')]","['10.24963/ijcai.2021/297', '10.1007/978-3-030-57628-8_14', '10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013387', '10.1142/S012905410300190X', '10.1007/10722167_15', '10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8', '10.1145/234528.234740', '10.1145/3302504.3311807', '10.1145/4904.4999', '10.1016/S0019-9958(84)80047-9', '10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_30', '10.1109/JAS.2014.7004690', '10.1609/aaai.v32i1.12107', '10.1109/DSAA.2018.00018', '10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7459105', '10.1145/971697.602266', '10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11694', '10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_11', '10.1007/3-540-58555-9_113', '10.1109/87.491203', '10.29007/9xgv', '10.1145/3341216.3342218', '10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_47', '10.1038/nature14236', '10.1109/TCST.2015.2501351', '10.1109/TIV.2016.2571067', '10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575328', '10.1145/3393691.3394176', '10.1145/3366703', '10.1145/3290354', '10.1109/QRS54544.2021.00037', '10.1145/3358230', '10.1038/s41592-019-0686-2', '10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2808470', '10.1142/S2705078520500150', '10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_22', '10.1145/3314221.3314638']",Springer International Publishing

Europe has numerous historic buildings that need to become more energy-efficient, which need permanent maintenance and refurbishment to fulfill sustainability and use requirements. Asset owners and asset managers need to adopt new strategies to protect listed buildings while optimizing costs and benefits during their life cycle. In this sense, the digital transition proves to be a moment to seize for opening new scenarios. The Digital Twin paradigm promises to be valuable for enabling the sustainable knowledge, conservation, restoration, and management of built assets and solving the dilemma about protecting the architectural identity of these buildings while adapting them to the functional and performance requirements dictated by the regulatory framework. This study proposes a workflow that integrates Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM) and Building Performance Simulation (BPS) tools for data-driving the energy improvement of Italian listed modern buildings built between the 1920s and 1960s. After acquiring information about the building, the HBIM model and the Building Energy Model (BEM) are realized based on the International Foundation Classes (IFC) standard. Energy intervention measures are defined, construction costs are computed, and benefits during the intervention life cycle are predicted in thermal demand. Finally, an expeditious multi-criteria analysis allows for comparing different intervention combinations and indicating the optimal solution for the energy improvement of the building concerning energy, economic, and financial issues. These outcomes represent the first step towards realizing a dynamic, accessible, and sharable Digital Twin.","[('A. Massafra', ''), ('G. Predari', ''), ('R. Gulli', '')]",[],Copernicus GmbH

Specifically, given a non-termination threshold $$p \in [0, 1],$$ p ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] , we aim for certificates proving that the program terminates with probability at least $$1-p$$ 1 - p . The basic idea of our approach is to find a terminating stochastic invariant, i.e. a subset $$ SI $$ SI of program states such that (i) the probability of the program ever leaving $$ SI $$ SI is no more than p, and (ii) almost-surely, the program either leaves $$ SI $$ SI or terminates.While stochastic invariants are already well-known, we provide the first proof that the idea above is not only sound, but also complete for quantitative termination analysis. We then introduce a novel sound and complete characterization of stochastic invariants that enables template-based approaches for easy synthesis of quantitative termination certificates, especially in affine or polynomial forms. Finally, by combining this idea with the existing martingale-based methods that are relatively complete for qualitative termination analysis, we obtain the first automated, sound, and relatively complete algorithm for quantitative termination analysis. Notably, our completeness guarantees for quantitative termination analysis are as strong as the best-known methods for the qualitative variant.Our prototype implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach on various probabilistic programs. We also demonstrate that our algorithm certifies lower bounds on termination probability for probabilistic programs that are beyond the reach of previous methods.","[('Krishnendu Chatterjee', ''), ('Amir Kafshdar Goharshady', ''), ('Tobias Meggendorfer', ''), ('Đorđe Žikelić', '')]","['10.1145/3158122', '10.1145/3453483.3454076', '10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_3', '10.1145/2933575.2934554', '10.1145/3453483.3454111', '10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_34', '10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_15', '10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_1', '10.1145/3385412.3385969', '10.1145/3174800', '10.1007/978-3-031-13185-1_4', '10.1007/978-3-030-90870-6_33', '10.1145/3009837.3009873', '10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_7', '10.1007/978-3-540-45069-6_39', '10.1515/crll.1902.124.1', '10.1016/S0019-9958(84)80039-X', '10.1145/800070.802191', '10.1007/978-3-662-49498-1_12', '10.1007/978-3-030-11245-5_22', '10.1038/nature14541', '10.1145/3371105', '10.1007/978-3-030-02768-1_11', '10.1145/3360555', '10.1145/3208102', '10.1007/978-3-642-15769-1_24', '10.1016/0022-0000(81)90036-2', '10.23638/LMCS-16(4:3)2020', '10.1007/b138392', '10.1145/3158121', '10.7717/peerj-cs.103', '10.1007/3-540-47764-0_7', '10.1007/978-3-030-72019-3_18', '10.1145/3192366.3192394', '10.1145/2933575.2935317', '10.1512/iumj.1993.42.42045', '10.1145/3450967', '10.1609/aimag.v21i4.1534', '10.1145/3453483.3454102', '10.1145/3314221.3314581']",Springer International Publishing

The construction of new land was a key component of the nation's celebrated rise from 'third world' to 'first world' in the postcolonial period. But the economic benefits of remaking Singapore's coastline came at significant ecological and social costs. Nearly all of the original shore, and its attendant mangrove forests and natural beaches, were lost. So too were two-thirds of Singapore's coral reefs. While carrying out this reclamation, the state also erased a number of sites at which people made a living from the sea, including indigenous communities on the outer islands, age-old fishing villages, kelongs (large, traditional offshore fishing platforms) and prawn farms. The history of land construction in Singapore offers a number of important insights concerning the relationship between humans and our environments. First, it reveals how the tensions between an ideal situation (a city or state's relationship to other places) and a less than optimum site (its physical environment), when combined with a forceful, proactive government, can bring about immense environmental transformations. Related to that, this case sheds light on the ways in which governments - especially in developing nations - can use transformation of terrestrial and marine environments, in the name of progress, as a means of expanding and legitimating their authority. This history also reveals a perhaps unforeseen consequence of bulldozing and burying sites at which humans derived their livelihood from living oceanic resources: the loss of a cultural connection to the sea, based on knowing nature through work. Finally, this history raises the question of how environmental advocates can pursue conservation in a setting like Singapore's shores, which we can no longer consider pristine or natural. That is to say, the ongoing efforts of environmentalists to protect flora and fauna in Singapore's waters speak to the necessity of, and challenges presented by, preserving hybrid (neither entirely natural nor entirely artificial) marine environments.","[('Miles Alexander Powell', 'School of Humanities Nanyang Technological University 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 639798')]",[],Liverpool University Press

We also provide an evaluation on the test set that validates the semantics and shows the novelty of the approach compared to other Solidity-level contract analysis tools.","[('Ákos Hajdu', ''), ('Dejan Jovanović', '')]","['10.1007/978-3-030-03427-6_28', '10.1145/3167084', '10.1007/978-3-662-54455-6_8', '10.1007/11804192_17', '10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_14', '10.3233/SAT190028', '10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_11', '10.1007/978-3-030-31500-9_15', '10.1145/2993600.2993611', '10.1007/11609773_28', '10.1007/978-3-030-43725-1_11', '10.1109/FMCAD.2009.5351142', '10.1007/978-1-4842-3081-7_6', '10.1007/978-3-642-37036-6_8', '10.1007/978-3-319-89722-6_10', '10.1007/978-3-030-41600-3_11', '10.1109/CSF.2018.00022', '10.1007/978-3-319-70278-0_33', '10.1007/978-3-642-17511-4_20', '10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24', '10.1007/978-3-030-03592-1_13']",Springer International Publishing

However, quantum noise is a major obstacle to the practical implementation of quantum machine learning. In this work, we define a formal framework for the robustness verification and analysis of quantum machine learning algorithms against noises. A robust bound is derived and an algorithm is developed to check whether or not a quantum machine learning algorithm is robust with respect to quantum training data. In particular, this algorithm can find adversarial examples during checking. Our approach is implemented on Google’s TensorFlow Quantum and can verify the robustness of quantum machine learning algorithms with respect to a small disturbance of noises, derived from the surrounding environment. The effectiveness of our robust bound and algorithm is confirmed by the experimental results, including quantum bits classification as the “Hello World” example, quantum phase recognition and cluster excitation detection from real world intractable physical problems, and the classification of MNIST from the classical world.","[('Ji Guan', ''), ('Wang Fang', ''), ('Mingsheng Ying', '')]","['10.1126/science.aag2302', '10.1017/CBO9780511976667', '10.1038/nature23474', '10.1088/1361-6633/aab406', '10.1038/s41567-019-0648-8', '10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.190505', '10.1145/2046684.2046692', '10.1145/3128572.3140444', '10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_2', '10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_3', '10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_6', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_25', '10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_1', '10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033212', '10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.023153', '10.1103/PhysRevA.101.062331', '10.1038/s41534-021-00410-5', '10.1016/S0019-9958(67)90302-6', '10.1109/CVPRW.2018.00211', '10.1038/s41534-020-00339-1', '10.1103/PhysRevA.83.053420', '10.1109/ICTC49870.2020.9289439', '10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.200502', '10.1103/PhysRevA.81.040302', '10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_7', '10.24963/ijcai.2019/824', '10.1109/CDC.2018.8619478', '10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5', '10.1088/1751-8113/41/23/235303']",Springer International Publishing

We argue for jettisoning this concept’s Huntingtonian baggage, which has led scholarship into a dead end, and developing a new body of theory on a different foundation, one grounded strongly in recent nonprimordial theories of identity and micro-level research into how ordinary people actually understand the civilizational appeals made by their elites. In what we believe to be the first systematic survey-based study of individual-level civilizational identification, we establish proof-of-concept by asking a question: What influences individuals’ primary identification of their own country with particular civilizational alternatives offered up by their elites? Pooling survey data gathered in Russia from 2013–2014, we confirm that civilizational identity reflects the influence of situational considerations and social construction processes. Whether individuals see Russia as part of purported “European,” “Eurasian,” or “Asian” civilizations depends heavily on gendered and nongendered socialization during the USSR period and factors as contingent as perceived economic performance. Results also confirm our expectation that Huntingtonian concepts fit poorly with real-world patterns of civilizational identification.","[('Henry E.

The nutrient delivery to shallow basins supported productivity and, because of O 2 consumption by organic-matter respiration, anoxia development. However, several studies have shown that calcareous nannoplankton experienced a decrease during the T-OAE. Nannofossil fluxes measured in the Llanbedr (Mochras Farm) borehole, Wales, UK, were the highest prior to the negative C-isotope excursion, along with high amounts of taxa indicative of nutrient-rich environments (Biscutaceae). Such conditions attest to high productivity. Fluxes show the lowest values in the core of the event, along with a size decrease of Schizosphaerella and a peak in Calyculaceae. The recovery of nannofossil fluxes and Schizosphaerella size occurred concomitant with the return of C-isotopes to more positive values. Concomitantly, deep dwellers ( Crepidolithus crassus ) dominated, indicating a recovery of the photic-zone productivity. These observations demonstrate that the cascade of environmental responses to the initial perturbation was more complex than previously considered. In spite of elevated nutrient delivery to epicontinental basins in the early Toarcian, carbonate and primary productions of nannoplankton were depressed in the core the T-OAE, probably because of prolonged thermohaline seawater stratification.","[('Alessandro Menini', 'Université de Lyon, UCBL, ENSL, UJM, CNRS, LGL-TPE, F-69622, Villeurbanne, France'), ('Emanuela Mattioli', 'Université de Lyon, UCBL, ENSL, UJM, CNRS, LGL-TPE, F-69622, Villeurbanne, France'), ('Emanuela Mattioli', 'Institut Universitaire de France'), ('Stephen P.

Thus, we have the conceptualization of intellectual imperialism, academic dependency, academic extractivism and academic capitalism. This essay focuses on two of these phenomenon, that is, intellectual imperialism and academic dependency, suggesting that they refer to different, yet related, problems in global knowledge production. While intellectual imperialism is a crucial starting point for the understanding of knowledge production in the Third World/Periphery/South, it interacts with academic dependency to maintain the underdevelopment of academia in many communities worldwide.","[('Syed Farid Alatas', 'Department of Sociology National University of Singapore  Singapore Singapore'), ('Syed Farid Alatas', 'Department of Anthropology\xa0&amp; Sociology University of Malaya  Kuala Lumpur Malaysia')]","['10.1177/00113921030516003', '10.1057/978-1-137-41134-1', '10.1163/030382400X00154', '10.1177/0011392106058831', '10.17763/haer.45.2.f2p87v8h618322m2', '10.1177/016146817707900201', '10.1080/19460171.2017.1403342']",Wiley
10.1093/pastj/gtz054,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,ON THE TRANSNATIONAL DESTRUCTION OF CITIES: WHAT JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES LEARNED FROM THE BOMBING OF BRITAIN AND GERMANY IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR,[],"Abstract How did it become ‘normal’ to bomb civilians? Focusing on the aerial bombardment of China, Germany, Britain, and Japan in 1937-45, this essay spotlights the role of transnational learning in the construction and destruction of ‘home fronts’. Belligerents vigorously studied each other's strategies to destroy the enemy's cities and ‘morale’, while investigating efforts to defend one's own home front by means of ‘civilian defence’. The inclusion of Japan, as bomber and bombed, contributes to a more global, connected history of the Second World War. Japan's sustained bombardment of Chinese cities not only reflected emerging transnational ideas of strategic bombing and total war, but also imparted new ‘lessons’ to Western air forces. Moreover, the devastating US firebombing of Japanese cities in 1945 challenges widely accepted judgments that bombing was generally ineffective, serving only to stiffen civilian morale. Why Japanese cities were bombed, and how they were bombed, was not an exceptional story, but was intimately connected to what the Allies had learned from bombing European urban areas.","[('Sheldon Garon', 'Princeton University')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

We disentangle this relationship by examining how populist attitudes relate to two distinct conceptions of nationhood: civic and ethnic national identity. We argue that a civic conception of nationhood is negatively related to populism, while an ethnic conception of nationhood is positively related. Additionally, we expect these relationships to be moderated by socio‐economic status. Using data from the German Longitudinal Election Study from 2017, our analyses show that, on average, both civic and ethnic conceptions of nationhood relate positively to populist attitudes. This finding, however, changes substantially once we account for socio‐economic status: For respondents with higher levels of education and/or a more positive evaluation of the state of the economy, the relationship between civic national identity and populism turns negative, which is more in line with our expectations. We find no moderation for an ethnic national identity.","[('Maximilian Filsinger', 'Institute of Political Science University of Bern  Bern Switzerland'), ('Steffen Wamsler', 'Institute of Political Science University of Bern  Bern Switzerland'), ('Julian Erhardt', 'Institute of Political Science University of Bern  Bern Switzerland'), ('Markus Freitag', 'Institute of Political Science University of Bern  Bern Switzerland')]","['10.1177/0003122420905127', '10.1177/0010414013512600', '10.1111/spsr.12275', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00532.x', '10.1080/01402382.2015.1004230', '10.1080/15705854.2010.524403', '10.1111/spsr.12326', '10.1111/0162-895X.00329', '10.1146/annurev-soc-081715-074412', '10.4159/9780674028944', '10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7', '10.1177/1065912919833176', '10.1111/0162-895X.00330', '10.1093/pan/mpn014', '10.1080/1369183X.2018.1550152', '10.5964/jspp.v7i1.557', '10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02029.x', '10.1111/spsr.12049', '10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02030.x', '10.2307/j.ctt7snkj.10', '10.1177/0020715218810331', '10.1017/S0003055409990372', '10.1111/ajps.12138', '10.4324/9781315196923', '10.1111/spsr.12281', '10.4324/9781315196923-1', '10.1111/nana.12235', '10.1016/j.jesp.2010.05.005', '10.1177/1368430208101058', '10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x', '10.1177/000312240907400404', '10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141107', '10.1111/nana.12345', '10.1080/00344893.2019.1643772', '10.1111/nana.12517', '10.1177/0090591700028001003', '10.1017/S0007123411000251', '10.1177/1354068819868908', '10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x', '10.1017/CBO9780511492037', '10.1177/0010414018789490', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2010.00446.x', '10.1057/s41269-017-0068-7', '10.1177/0267323117737952', '10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00050.x', '10.1111/0162-895X.00140', '10.1177/0020715218816242', '10.1017/S0003055409090194', '10.1177/0010414002035005003', '10.4324/9780203167960', '10.1093/ijpor/edk007', '10.1177/1065912916639138', '10.1146/annurev-polisci-022018-024059', '10.1177/0263395719859306', '10.1111/1475-6765.12216', '10.1080/00224545.2016.1184125', '10.1086/522803', '10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00843.x', '10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00885.x', '10.1017/S0003055419000807', '10.1111/1469-8219.00081']",Wiley

Following social anthropologists Gingrich and Banks, the term neonationalism will be applied and linked with the concept “mythomoteur” of John Armstrong and Anthony D. Smith, emphasizing the role of preexisting ethno-symbolic resources or mythomoteurs in the resurgence of nationalism. Special attention will be given to elites who play a major role in constructing new discourses of the nation and seek to control collective memories, taking their diverse intentions, agendas, and strategies specifically into consideration. This “view from above” will be complemented with a “view from below” by investigating the meanings that audiences give to and the uses they make of these memories. Thus, the analysis has three dimensions: it starts with the analysis of symbols, topics, and arguments applied by public Trianon discourses; it continues with the analysis of everyday perceptions, memory, and identity concerns; and finally ends with an anthropological interpretation of memory politics regarding a new form of nationalism arising in the context of propelling and mainstreaming populist right-wing politics. The main argument of this article is that although the Hungarian Trianon cult, identified as national mythomoteur, invokes a historical trauma, it rather speaks to current feelings of loss and disenfranchisement, offering symbolic compensation through the transference of historical glory, pride, and self-esteem within a mythological framework. This article is part of a larger effort to understand the cultural logic and social support of new forms of nationalism in Hungary propelled by the populist far right.","[('Margit Feischmidt', '')]","['10.3167/9780857452030', '10.7208/chicago/9780226993058.001.0001', '10.1111/1469-8676.12420', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00491.x', '10.1093/oso/9780198295341.003.0011', '10.1007/s11133-010-9184-7', '10.1017/S0010417502000336', '10.1177/1468796808088925', '10.2307/j.ctt9qd8t4', '10.1080/09637499008431450', '10.3167/9781845451899', '10.1017/S0010417517000202', '10.1111/nana.12264', '10.1525/ae.1991.18.3.02a00020', '10.1515/9786155225468-005', '10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.105']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

The princely states were ruled by indigenous rulers and were not considered to be British territory, but remained subject to British “influence;” as a result, there were numerous controversies over their legal status. During the course of jurisdictional disputes, a variety of interested players - British politicians, colonial officials, international lawyers, rulers and advisors of princely states - engaged in debates over the idea of sovereignty to resolve questions of legal status, the extent of rights and powers, and to construct a political order that supported their interests and aspirations. I focus on legal texts written by British international lawyers and colonial officials as well as material relating to two jurisdictional disputes (one between the state of Travancore and the British Government and another between the state of Baroda and the British Government) to trace two versions of sovereignty that were articulated in late nineteenth century South Asia - unitary and divisible. In doing so, I argue that international law, and the doctrine of sovereignty in particular, became the shared language for participants to debate political problems and a key forum for the negotiation of political power.","[('Priyasha Saksena', '')]","['10.1017/CBO9780511973574', '10.1017/CBO9780511494277', '10.1177/001946460804600101', '10.1111/j.1747-4469.2007.00087.x', '10.4159/9780674972780', '10.1353/imp.2018.0060', '10.1093/he/9780198737445.003.0004', '10.3917/mond1.151.0095', '10.1017/CBO9781316118665.008', '10.1093/bybil/75.1.9', '10.1017/S0922156599000023', '10.1017/CBO9781139015424', '10.4159/harvard.9780674067356', '10.2307/3102572', '10.1017/CBO9780511583292', '10.1525/9780520933330', '10.1017/CBO9780511730252', '10.1017/CBO9781139096744.015', '10.1515/9780691207223', '10.2307/2547846', '10.1017/CBO9780511494222.003', '10.1515/9781400835072', '10.1353/imp.2018.0059', '10.7228/manchester/9780719079092.003.0003', '10.1017/S073824801000074X', '10.1017/S0026749X17000257', '10.2307/3053874', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190648664.001.0001', '10.1017/S0026749X17000981', '10.1093/lril/lrt005', '10.1017/S0018246X14000259', '10.7312/chen17374', '10.1017/S0738248000002583', '10.1016/j.jhg.2015.06.015', '10.1017/CBO9780511614262', '10.1017/9781316414880', '10.1017/CBO9780511490439', '10.4159/9780674986275', '10.1016/j.jhg.2013.03.002', '10.1017/S0738248016000195', '10.1163/15718050-12340100', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198766070.001.0001', '10.1515/9781400876648', '10.1017/S0738248015000115', '10.1163/ej.9789004154810.i-255.20', '10.1017/S0026749X12000728', '10.1163/9789004644793', '10.1017/S084182090000360X', '10.1515/9781400842605', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199792054.001.0001', '10.1057/9780230289604', '10.1215/1089201X-2826037']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Its main argument is that, contrary to wide held assumptions in the historiography, what characterized Late Antiquity was not simply the exacerbation of violence or its tighter control, but the crisis of aristocratic hegemony and the expansion of opportunities for popular intervention in city life. What has been perceived as the product fanaticism, irrationality and deprivation of the masses, of the manipulation of bishops and aristocrats or of the failure of the mechanisms of coercion was actually the result of a dramatic social change that, on the one hand, involved a new dynamic of power and, on the other, a shift in the way the people understood their role and power in local communities.","[('Julio Cesar Magalhães de Oliveira', 'University of São Paulo')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

In this era of intensive commemoration of the events that unfolded between 1912 and 1923, this special issue serves to remind us that the history of the revolution should not be confined to the island of Ireland.

10.1111/ehr.12971,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Infant and child mortality by socio-economic status in early nineteenth-century England †,[],"AbstractHistorical relationships between socio‐economic status and mortality remain poorly understood. This is particularly the case in England, due to a lack of status indicators in available sources especially beforec. 1850. This study uses the paternal occupational descriptors routinely recorded in Anglican baptism registers from 1813–37 to compare infant and early childhood mortality by social status. The sample consists of eight of the Cambridge Group family reconstitution parishes, which make it possible to investigate the contributions of environment as well as household characteristics. The main variable of interest was an individual‐level continuous measure of wealth based on ranking paternal occupations by the propensity for their movable wealth to be inventoried upon death. The findings show that wealth conferred no clear survival advantage in infancy, once differences in average mortality levels between parishes were adjusted for. However, wealth was associated with higher survival rates in early childhood, especially in the second year of life, and this pattern persisted after adjustment for parish‐level effects. The striking exception to this pattern was labourers, who were among the poorest of fathers but whose children enjoyed relatively low mortality. Thus socio‐economic differentials in mortality were present in early nineteenth‐century England; however, they were small, age‐specific, and non‐linear.","[('Hannaliis Jaadla', 'Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure University of Cambridge , and Estonian Institute for Population Studies Tallinn University'), ('Ellen Potter', 'Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure University of Cambridge'), ('Sebastian Keibek', 'Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure University of Cambridge'), ('Romola Davenport', 'Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure University of Cambridge')]","['10.2307/3348839', '10.7551/mitpress/4227.001.0001', '10.1080/01615440903270299', '10.1016/j.eeh.2011.05.005', '10.1017/S136149161100013X', '10.1007/s13524-017-0556-4', '10.1007/s13524-019-00786-2', '10.1016/0277-9536(88)90201-8', '10.1007/s13524-016-0495-5', '10.1080/24694452.2016.1261682', '10.1080/1081602X.2019.1580601', '10.1016/j.eeh.2011.05.007', '10.1002/psp.2232', '10.1017/CBO9780511735325', '10.1017/CBO9780511975912', '10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61257-3', '10.1017/CBO9780511495816', '10.2307/1531814', '10.4054/DemRes.2017.37.58', '10.1002/9781118504338.ch10', '10.2307/2060586', '10.1017/S002572730004686X', '10.1080/01615440.2012.715569', '10.1080/0032472031000142536', '10.1017/CBO9780511661617.008', '10.1016/S1081-602X(02)00127-6', '10.2307/2626958', '10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.02.031', '10.1056/NEJMsa0707519', '10.2307/2807954', '10.1093/shm/hkq042', '10.1128/CDLI.6.6.868-871.1999', '10.1080/0032472031000141256', '10.1177/0022146510383498', '10.1179/174963207X227578', '10.1093/past/131.1.89', '10.1163/9789004638679_010', '10.4054/DemRes.2018.39.18', '10.1016/0014-4983(73)90026-0', '10.1016/j.eeh.2011.05.011', '10.1111/j.1468-0289.2010.00585.x', '10.1016/j.hisfam.2008.08.001', '10.18356/85946e24-en', '10.1177/002214650704800401', '10.1093/shm/5.1.71', '10.1080/0032472031000146976', '10.1017/CBO9780511496127', '10.1080/0032472031000143516', '10.1017/S0268416000002514', '10.1017/CBO9780511660344']",Wiley

In this process, MPs formulated criteria for membership and non‐membership of the Swiss nation which, we argue, reflect wider political dynamics, best understood through the lens of femonationalism.","[('Dina Bader', 'Department of Sociology New York University  New York'), ('Véronique Mottier', 'Jesus College  Cambridge UK'), ('Véronique Mottier', 'Centre en Etudes Genre University of Lausanne  Lausanne Switzerland')]","['10.1525/aa.2002.104.3.783', '10.1111/nana.12329', '10.1515/sjs-2016-0025', '10.1080/14680777.2018.1560348', '10.1016/S0968-8080(10)35506-6', '10.1177/1350506811435032', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00520.x', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2010.00453.x', '10.1177/1350506809350857', '10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02029.x', '10.1215/9780822372929', '10.3917/mult.026.0123', '10.1080/14616660500200223', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00519.x', '10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2015.10.012', '10.1017/CBO9780511790676', '10.1057/9781137442741_13', '10.1177/0038038510375740', '10.1080/13688790.2015.1191987', '10.1787/9789264307216-en', '10.1057/9781137442741', '10.1111/j.1354-5078.2005.00199.x', '10.1080/014198798329784', '10.1055/s-0041-111171', '10.1017/CBO9780511490415']",Wiley

Specifically, two main objectives of this study are (1) to explore the mediation role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy in the relationship between entrepreneurial education and start-up intention and (2) to investigate the moderate role of family support on the effect of entrepreneurial education on entrepreneurial intention.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a sample of 1879 students in Vietnam and SPSS PROCESS macro developed by Hayes (2012) to examine the indirect effect of entrepreneurial education on start-up intention via entrepreneurial self-efficacy and the moderated mediation effect of family support.FindingsThis study reveals that the association between entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial intention is partially mediated via entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Also, the effect of entrepreneurial education on entrepreneurial self-efficacy and start-up intention was negatively moderated by family support. Furthermore, the indirect effect of entrepreneurial education on intention to form a venture via entrepreneurial self-efficacy is also negatively moderated by family support.Originality/valueThe entrepreneurial education and start-up intention linkage remain a significant gap in the entrepreneurship literature.

It demonstrates that the climatic fluctuations characterizing these environmental crises were synchronized with global climatic oscillations, specifically the El Niño Southern Oscillation. Recurrent episodes of severe drought and cold dramatically affected these groups, who were unable to withstand extreme changes in temperature and precipitation. Back-to-back drought episodes created a shortage of water, dried up pastures and damaged forage, while severe cold resulted in high rates of premature death among herd animals. These climatic events thus had devastating economic and social consequences.","[('Zozan Pehlivan', 'University of Minnesota Twin Cities')]",[],Walter de Gruyter GmbH

We draw on original interviews with diasporic youth in France, the United Kingdom, and Russia—diasporas that were largely built in the aftermath of the genocide and the Karabakh war. Diaspora youth relate to these events through transmitted collective memories, but also reconnect with the distant homeland’s past and present in new ways as they engage with new possibilities of transnational digital communication and mobility. Their experiences of identity shed light on how the new generation of diasporic Armenians defines itself in relation to the past; how this past is (re)made present in their interpretations of the Karabakh conflict and in everyday behaviors; and how diasporic youth experience the dilemmas of “moving on” from traumatic narratives that for a long time have been seen as foundational to their identity.","[('Dmitry Chernobrov', ''), ('Leila Wilmers', '')]","['10.1177/1468796819866973', '10.1080/1369183X.2017.1313104', '10.1111/pops.12433', '10.4324/9780203553336', '10.1111/glob.12150', '10.1191/1478088706qp063oa', '10.1080/1369183X.2017.1354159', '10.1080/014198700329105', '10.1111/j.1754-9469.2010.01079.x', '10.1080/00905992.2013.767227', '10.1177/1354066112445290', '10.16997/wpcc.203', '10.1080/1369183X.2017.1354152', '10.1017/S0260210510001737', '10.1111/imig.12183', '10.1111/j.1749-8198.2007.00033.x', '10.1080/13645570701401305', '10.1017/CBO9780511489402', '10.1080/14746689.2013.820483', '10.1080/01419870.2012.674542', '10.1177/146144804044327', '10.1080/00905992.2017.1347917', '10.1525/pol.1999.22.2.80', '10.1080/714000931', '10.1215/08992363-14-2-411', '10.1080/0141987042000289997', '10.1016/j.polgeo.2017.01.002']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

First, verifier developers must contend with the rapidly changing DNN field to support new DNN operations and property types. Second, verifier users have the burden of selecting a verifier input format to specify their problem. Due to the many input formats, this decision can greatly restrict the verifiers that a user may run. Finally, researchers face difficulties in re-using benchmarks to evaluate and compare verifiers, due to the large number of input formats required to run different verifiers. Existing benchmarks are rarely in formats supported by verifiers other than the one for which the benchmark was introduced. In this work we present DNNV, a framework for reducing the burden on DNN verifier researchers, developers, and users. DNNV standardizes input and output formats, includes a simple yet expressive DSL for specifying DNN properties, and provides powerful simplification and reduction operations to facilitate the application, development, and comparison of DNN verifiers. We show how DNNV increases the support of verifiers for existing benchmarks from 30% to 74%.","[('David Shriver', ''), ('Sebastian Elbaum', ''), ('Matthew B.

Degree Apprenticeships aid public-sector recruitment, support progression routes and social mobility within the existing workforce, and contribute to recruitment and productivity in public services and economically critical industries. Practices in the organisation and delivery of apprenticeships are variable, but a clear need is illustrated for strong institution–employer partnerships, integration between on- and off-the-job learning, expansive workplace learning environments, and co-ordination of assessment and quality assurance. There is also a need for external bodies to provide a consistent policy and funding environment.Practical implicationsThe findings illustrate the need for strong partnerships, for programmes that are designed from the ground up as apprenticeships, and for effective integration of apprentices into the organisation's working environment.Originality/valueThis study updates and adds to the literature on DAs and work-integrated higher education. It emphasises three aspects that have hitherto been given little attention: the value of DAs for public-sector recruitment and for creating social mobility within the existing workforce, and the importance of ensuring apprenticeships are aligned with organisational objectives.","[('Stan Lester', '')]","['10.1108/HESWBL-01-2018-0006', '10.1080/01425699995380', '10.4018/978-1-5225-6977-0.ch003', '10.1108/ET-10-2015-0091', '10.4018/978-1-4666-8856-8.ch008', '10.1080/02602930600848267', '10.1108/HESWBL-05-2019-123', '10.1080/0309877X.2012.699516', '10.1108/HESWBL-10-2018-0106', '10.1108/HESWBL-10-2018-0113', '10.1108/20423891111128890', '10.1108/HESWBL-10-2018-0099', '10.1108/HESWBL-10-2018-0108', '10.1108/HESWBL-06-2016-0042', '10.1108/HESWBL-02-2019-0024']",Emerald

We consider a forward-mode AD method on a higher order language with algebraic data types, and we characterise it as the unique structure preserving macro given a choice of derivatives for basic operations. We describe a rich semantics for differentiable programming, based on diffeological spaces. We show that it interprets our language, and we phrase what it means for the AD method to be correct with respect to this semantics. We show that our characterisation of AD gives rise to an elegant semantic proof of its correctness based on a gluing construction on diffeological spaces. We explain how this is, in essence, a logical relations argument. Finally, we sketch how the analysis extends to other AD methods by considering a continuation-based method.","[('Mathieu Huot', ''), ('Sam Staton', ''), ('Matthijs Vákár', '')]","['10.1145/3371106', '10.1090/S0002-9947-2011-05107-X', '10.1007/978-3-030-44914-8_3', '10.1145/3371132', '10.1016/S0304-3975(03)00392-X', '10.1145/3236765', '10.1109/LICS.2019.8785665', '10.1090/surv/185', '10.1214/aoms/1177729392', '10.1007/BF01589116', '10.1016/j.entcs.2012.08.017', '10.1007/3-540-56992-8_21', '10.1201/b10905-6', '10.1145/1330017.1330018', '10.1016/S0893-6080(98)00116-6', '10.1214/aoms/1177729586', '10.1145/3341701', '10.1007/BFb0089728', '10.1145/3341700']",Springer International Publishing

It also tells the story of an important moment of race-making in the years after the Second World War. Though Kenya may be considered a frontier market for today's biometrics industry, fingerprinting was first introduced in the early twentieth century. By 1920, the Kenyan colonial government had dictated that African men who left their reserves be fingerprinted and issued an identity card (known colloquially as akipande). In the late 1940s, after decades of African protest, the colonial government replaced thekipandewith a universal system of registration via fingerprinting. This legislative move was accompanied by protests from members of the white settler community. Ironically, the effort to deracialize Kenya's identification regime only further normalized the use of biometrics, but also failed to fully undermine associations between white male exceptionalism and exemption from fingerprinting.","[('KEREN WEITZBERG', '')]","['10.2307/j.ctvjz80ss', '10.1057/9780230392960', '10.1525/california/9780520290495.001.0001', '10.1017/S0001972010000070', '10.1017/S0010417506000338', '10.2307/j.ctv14gpj6p', '10.1017/asr.2016.36', '10.5871/bacad/9780197265314.001.0001', '10.1017/asr.2016.39', '10.1017/CBO9781139939546', '10.5040/9781350219656', '10.1093/hwj/dbp026', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a097774', '10.1080/03057078608708131', '10.1080/13621025.2014.865892', '10.1017/CBO9780511584091', '10.13109/gege.2016.42.1.60', '10.1093/ahr/119.1.78', '10.1017/S002185370000774X', '10.2307/j.ctv224txv2', '10.1525/california/9780520272149.001.0001', '10.2307/525576', '10.1215/08992363-1161940', '10.1007/978-1-349-17960-2', '10.1215/9780822394822', '10.2307/j.ctt1pwt9w5', '10.4324/9781315692593', '10.1080/01419870903428505']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

From this perspective, the paper describes the functionalities of various digital writing assistants and focuses on one of them, namely the Spanish-English Write Assistant. It illustrates some decisions that have to be taken to prepare a database to feed both this tool and a series of online dictionaries. A proposal on how a big amount of lexicographical data can be presented in a small pop-up window without resorting to data overload will be discussed.

The following source controls of the rock system are considered: (1) initial magnesium and iron content; (2) initial sodium and calcium content; (3) pressure–temperature path followed by the system; and (4) threshold by which melt extractions in the system are triggered. These source controls are investigated in a water-restricted system and a water-in-excess system. The permutation of these cases resulted in 128 different modelled pressure–temperature bulk composition paths investigating the melting of an average pelite composition. The resultant melt compositions are compared to that of a natural granite dataset and provide a good fit for the incompatible elements Na 2 O and K 2 O with the allowance that granites most likely form as magmas consisting of melt and ferromagnesian-rich crystals. The fluid state of the system is shown to have the strongest control on melt compositions, with the pressure–temperature path having subordinate control on the volume and composition of melts produced.","[('Matthew J.

Irradiated samples were step-heated in an ultra-high-vacuum resistance furnace attached to a mass spectrometer, thus also allowing 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology. Conjoint inversion of these datasets allowed estimation of the relevant diffusion parameters, which were then used to forward model the effect of arbitrary temperature–time histories. Simulations used Monte Carlo methods to improve approximations to the observed age spectra. Two periods of rapid cooling could be inferred. The South Cyclades Shear Zone commenced operation during or shortly after the Eocene–Oligocene transition. Episodes of south-directed movement continued into Early Miocene time, however, with the footwall still hot enough to cause biotite ± garnet metamorphic mineral growth at the base of the overlying, already substantially exhumed, eclogite–blueschist unit. Since its footwall continued to cool, the South Cyclades Shear Zone was an extensional shear zone during both episodes of its operation.","[('Marnie Forster', ''), ('Oleg Koudashev', ''), ('Ruoran Nie', ''), ('Sonia Yeung', ''), ('Gordon Lister', '')]","['10.1007/s00531-015-1255-2', '10.1002/2014TC003664', '10.1016/0191-8141(93)90006-V', '10.1029/97TC02003', '10.1029/97JB03106', '10.1016/j.epsl.2008.02.038', '10.1139/cjes-2015-0203', '10.1016/0191-8141(91)90027-G', '10.1017/S0016756806002585', '10.1111/jmg.12228', '10.1130/0091-7613(1986)14<7:SEOTWA>2.0.CO;2', '10.1130/0091-7613(1983)11<342:SMFTOO>2.0.CO;2', '10.1016/0191-8141(87)90053-8', '10.1016/j.lithos.2015.04.007', '10.1144/SP311.6', '10.1016/0024-4937(90)90003-J', '10.1144/GSL.SP.1999.154.01.14', '10.1016/j.jsg.2003.10.004', '10.1007/s00410-005-0032-9', '10.1144/0016-76492007-016', '10.1029/2007JB005382', '10.1144/SP332.2', '10.1080/08120099.2015.1114524', '10.1016/0040-1951(94)90066-3', '10.1029/93TC01131', '10.1130/L164.1', '10.1016/j.lithos.2008.10.005', '10.1016/j.pnsc.2008.01.016', '10.1016/j.gca.2008.09.038', '10.1016/j.jsg.2018.12.008', '10.1029/2008TC002397', '10.1017/S0016756814000661', '10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04372.x', '10.1007/s00531-008-0366-4', '10.1029/2000TC900018', '10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027<0067:OMBKEG>2.3.CO;2', '10.2475/ajs.303.5.353', '10.1130/0-8137-2380-9.185', '10.1130/0-8137-2380-9.185', '10.1016/j.epsl.2009.10.032', '10.1016/j.tecto.2012.06.011', '10.1130/0-8137-2409-0.97', '10.1016/j.lithos.2016.12.013', '10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020<0121:LMDEAD>2.3.CO;2', '10.1016/j.jsg.2004.02.013', '10.1016/0191-8141(89)90036-9', '10.1016/j.lithos.2008.10.024', '10.1111/jmg.12178', '10.1130/0091-7613(1984)12<221:MCCOCT>2.0.CO;2', '10.1144/GSL.SP.2001.184.01.06', '10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00147-6', '10.1016/S0016-7037(01)00846-8', '10.1016/0025-3227(90)90060-W', '10.1144/gsjgs.156.2.0261', '10.1144/GSL.SP.1999.154.01.05', '10.1146/annurev.earth.34.031405.125202', '10.1130/0091-7613(1990)018<0216:FOMZIC>2.3.CO;2', '10.1146/annurev.earth.050708.170910', '10.1144/0016-76492010-064', '10.1016/j.jog.2016.03.008', '10.3809/jvirtex.2007.00181', '10.1007/BF00371243', '10.1046/j.1525-1314.2003.00482.x', '10.1016/j.lithos.2011.02.005', '10.1111/ter.12357', '10.1144/SP321.7', '10.1144/GSL.SP.1990.054.01.47', '10.1016/j.epsl.2017.12.031', '10.1016/S0191-8141(96)00068-5', '10.1130/B26102.1', '10.1111/j.1365-2117.1988.tb00001.x', '10.1016/S0040-1951(98)00182-6', '10.1029/2011TC002946']",Geological Society of London

This article explores why these conclusions took hold; the European deification of animal protein in previous centuries; structural changes to African diets and food economies under colonial government; and the political value of such a consensus. Unlike elsewhere in the world, where deficiency was removed from the exceptionalism of tropical medicine, protein malnutrition was constructed as a particularly African concern. Focusing this discussion on the history of the severe childhood deficiency, kwashiorkor, this article explores how the politically informed othering of African nutrition came to direct, or misdirect, the medicine of malnutrition in twentieth-century Africa.","[('John Nott', 'Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASoS), Maastricht University, Grote Gracht 90-92, 6211 SZ Maastricht, The Netherlands')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

The preprocessor checks for the feasibility of performing a lightweight slicing of the input code using function call graph and variable reference information. By this if the program is found to besliceable, sub-programs or slices are generated, and the known strategy selection algorithm of VeriAbs is applied to each slice.

This article uses a framework that analyses the type of transfer (materials, knowledge, or capacity), the roles of diverse actors, and farmer demand and its market context, to trace the diffusion of hybrid technology to Latin America, Asia, Europe, and Africa up to 1970. The article also highlights the importance of access to diverse germplasm from the Americas provided by indigenous farmers. A handful of US public institutions promoted the spread of hybrid technology, with US private seed companies sometimes playing a secondary role. However, most cases of successful transfer were led by national scientists embedded in local institutions, who were able to link to local seed systems and farmers. By the mid 1970s, the aggregate impacts of these efforts were of the same magnitude as for the well-known and much publicized green revolution wheat varieties. Nonetheless, adoption of hybrid maize across and within countries was very patchy, relating to differences in scientific capacity, type of farmer, agro-ecology, and complementary investments in seed systems and extension. Consequently, impacts were often highly inequitable.","[('Derek Byerlee', '')]","['10.1007/s40656-017-0131-8', '10.1007/BF00022431', '10.1080/03768359508439804', '10.1007/BF01098663', '10.1215/00021482-74.2.393', '10.1086/451461', '10.2307/1905380', '10.1080/14735903.2006.9684793', '10.5962/bhl.title.145956', '10.1177/030631286016003003', '10.1590/S0006-87051943001100001', '10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183X003900010001x', '10.1007/BF02858749', '10.2134/agronj1934.00021962002600020002x', '10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00040-0', '10.1093/genetics/169.4.1787', '10.2307/j.ctt22726tg', '10.2307/j.ctvjnrv65', '10.1038/35047587', '10.1038/scientificamerican0851-39', '10.4159/harvard.9780674335882', '10.2134/agronj1955.00021962004700010002x', '10.1007/BF02908218', '10.7208/chicago/9780226330297.001.0001', '10.2307/3102398', '10.1515/9781685851675', '10.1126/science.1078710', '10.1080/05331846609438425']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

While one designates the palatable characteristics of place as a branded story of geographic distinction, the other imbues the soil with political meaning. This paper traces the production of eno-locality in a contested space on both sides of the Green Line in Israel/Palestine. The case of the Yatir award-winning winery shows how terroir and territory are blended in the political economy and cultural politics of colonial place-making. Located on a multiscalar frontier—climatic, geopolitical, and viticultural—Yatir Winery positions itself simultaneously within the Mediterranean transnational landscape and in a biblical site of historical authenticity. Enacting strategic regimes of signification to target the increasing demand for high-end wines on both the global and local markets, it makes a claim for place, while appropriating Palestinian land and redefining ancient Jewish heritage. The result articulates a settler colonial landscape whose symbolic and material transformations are reflected in the Israeli search for rooted identity. Analytically, we explore the power of border and frontier wines to reconfigure the differences between New World and Old World paradigms. We conclude by outlining a comparative framework of the charged relations between terroir and territory that articulates the nexus between border typologies and the colonial politics of wine.","[('Daniel Monterescu', ''), ('Ariel Handel', '')]","['10.2307/j.ctv102bhmf', '10.1146/annurev-anthro-102317-050249', '10.1525/gfc.2014.14.4.69', '10.1111/j.1467-9655.2011.01714.x', '10.1057/9780230299191', '10.5040/9781350042254.ch-004', '10.5204/mcj.948', '10.1179/175272608X360238', '10.1016/0278-4165(90)90011-2', '10.1016/j.poetic.2017.10.002', '10.1080/17409291003644206', '10.1177/0308518X15594917', '10.1007/s10624-019-09560-7', '10.1111/j.1467-8306.2004.00438.x', '10.1111/j.1548-1425.2011.01326.x', '10.1525/9780520934139', '10.1080/0957126022000017981', '10.5040/9781350042254', '10.1080/09518960500495172', '10.2307/j.ctt2005x0w', '10.7208/chicago/9780226041285.001.0001', '10.1146/annurev.anthro.28.1.0', '10.5153/sro.2339', '10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123120', '10.1111/j.1533-8525.2012.01248.x', '10.2979/isr.2011.16.1.179', '10.1525/9780520966734', '10.1177/1463499605050866', '10.1007/978-0-230-37059-3', '10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01251.x', '10.2752/175174413X13589681351331', '10.1177/0162243911423843', '10.1515/9781400835218', '10.1177/0003122410372226', '10.1111/amet.12827']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Conventional models propose that upper slope failures are funneled into submarine canyons and develop into turbidity flows that are routed down-canyon to deep-water channel and fan systems. However, the sources and pathways of these turbidity flows are poorly constrained, leading to uncertainties in the connections between ground shaking, slope failure and deep-water turbidites. We examine the spatial distribution of submarine landslides along the southern Cascadia margin to identify source regions for slope failures that may have developed into turbidity flows. Using multibeam bathymetry, sparker multichannel seismic and chirp sub-bottom data, we observe relatively few canyon head slope failures and limited evidence of large landslides on the upper and middle slope. Most of the submarine canyons are draped with sediment infill in the upper reaches and do not appear to be active sediment conduits during the recent sea-level highstand. In contrast, there is evidence of extensive mass wasting of the lower slope and non-channelized downslope flows. Contrary to previous studies, we propose that failures along the lower slope are the primary sources for deep-sea seismoturbidites in southern Cascadia.","[('Jenna C. Hill', ''), ('Janet T.

10.1093/ehr/ceaa008,ENGLISH HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,"Settlement, Identity, and Memory in the Latin East: An Examination of the Term 'Crusader States'",[],"Abstract In a recent article, Christopher MacEvitt posited that historians should eschew the term ‘crusader states’ to describe the four polities formed in the Levant and Syria as a result of the First Crusade (the kingdom of Jerusalem, the principality of Antioch, and the counties of Edessa and Tripoli), arguing that crusading and its remembrance had little influence in the east, and so these states should not be viewed as extensions of the west. This paper seeks to offer a critical response to this by making use of the methodological approaches which have recently traced the emergence, influence and definitions of crusading in the Latin West and have re-situated the movement within broader patterns of elite behaviours and cultural identities. The aim, therefore, is to examine the processes of identity formation among Latin settlers in the east, the active remembrance and memorialisation of the First Crusade, and, most especially, what influence the latter had over the nature of inter-cultural contact. It does so by adopting an interdisciplinary approach, which incorporates textual, literary, vernacular, documentary, material and artistic evidence. It will be argued that, although the term ‘crusader state’ cannot be used in a monolithic sense, it nevertheless remains a crucial medium through which to understand the complex social and cultural history of the Latin polities of Outremer, as well as their impact on the Near East. Examination of this concept not only contributes to modern understanding of these states, it also lends greater depth to historiographical discussions on the nature of the crusading movement as a whole.","[('Andrew D Buck', 'University College Dublin')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

This controversy stems from the fact that the granites may result from fractionation of mantle-derived basaltic magmas or partial melting of different crustal protoliths at contrasting pressure–temperature conditions, either water-fluxed or fluid-absent. Consequently, many different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the compositional variability of granites ranging from whole igneous suites down to mineral scale.

10.1111/ehr.13080,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Perceptions of plague in eighteenth-century Europe†,[],"AbstractMajor epidemics of plague in Germany and France in the early eighteenth century and in Moscow in the 1770s brought an end to a series of epidemic disasters in Europe which had started with the Black Death. The article examines what they had in common, and seeks to understand why they should have ended when they did. It shows that European governors were unanimous in insisting on rigid quarantine and other measures for containing the disease developed over previous centuries, despite their ignorance of plague's precise causes. It shows also that physicians across Europe were more deeply divided than they had ever been on the issue of contagion, and now engaged in an international dispute about whether the acknowledged cruelties inflicted by compulsory quarantines were wholly counterproductive, or a price worth paying for the prevention of still worse disasters. The article concludes by drawing on recent work on plague in the Ottoman Empire, and on research into the ancient DNA of the second pandemic, in order to set the epidemic history of western Europe in a wider comparative context.","[('Paul Slack', 'Linacre College Oxford')]","['10.1093/ereh/het013', '10.1080/00324728.2018.1457794', '10.1017/S0022050717000092', '10.1111/ehr.12652', '10.2307/2595837', '10.1017/CBO9780511497544', '10.1080/0032472031000142976', '10.1515/9788376560472', '10.2307/j.ctvvnc4d.13', '10.7788/boehlau.9783412321109.295', '10.1515/9781474423397', '10.1093/jhmas/53.2.132', '10.17302/TMG.1-1.7', '10.1111/1600-0498.12370', '10.1017/9781108751773', '10.1017/S0025727300072100', '10.1111/ehr.12098', '10.3917/perri.dupaq.1985.01', '10.1353/bhm.2000.0015', '10.1353/ecs.2016.0014', '10.3917/adh.134.0095', '10.1111/1600-0498.12305', '10.1111/1600-0498.12303', '10.2307/2928672', '10.1080/03468750500507495', '10.1093/oso/9780195061406.001.0001', '10.1162/002219503322645439', '10.1093/pastj/gtz009', '10.1111/1600-0498.12299', '10.1002/bies.201900160', '10.1093/oso/9780195055238.001.0001', '10.1093/jhmas/XXVIII.1.15', '10.1111/ehr.12097', '10.2307/2595884', '10.21820/23987073.2018.3.60', '10.1093/pastj/gty018', '10.1038/s41467-019-12154-0', '10.17302/TMG.1-1.8', '10.2307/j.ctvvnc4d.7', '10.1017/npt.2020.27', '10.1093/clinids/11.5.808', '10.1093/hwj/dbi060', '10.1017/S0020743810000814']",Wiley

We explore how the successful handling of COVID‐19 shaped South Korean citizens' perception of their country. Empirically, we compare data from surveys conducted in August 2019 and April 2020. Using regression on matched samples, we find a significant increase in general national pride. More importantly, we find an increase in positive assessments of their country in domains directly related to the COVID‐19 response (civic awareness and international leadership) but not in domains less directly related to the pandemic. We also find that while Koreans take pride in their collective response to the crisis, their disenchantment with the political class has grown. The implication is that citizens offer a remarkably nuanced understanding of how the COVID‐19 response reflected the strengths of the Korean society, as opposed to the Korean political system.","[('Sijeong Lim', 'Division of International Studies Korea University  Seoul South Korea'), ('Aseem Prakash', 'Department of Political Science University of Washington  Seattle Washington USA')]","['10.1353/wp.1997.0008', '10.1111/bjso.12397', '10.1017/nps.2020.35', '10.1111/0162-895X.00329', '10.1177/0003122416663683', '10.1080/1362102042000214705', '10.1177/0090591701029006008', '10.1515/9780804786188', '10.1080/713999116', '10.1111/1540-5907.00012', '10.1186/s40985-017-0065-4', '10.4324/9781315746111-6', '10.1080/01900690701215888', '10.1111/pops.12294', '10.1017/S0021911818000438', '10.1111/j.1468-0335.2011.00900.x', '10.1017/S0007123402000248', '10.1017/S0022381607080097', '10.1017/rep.2015.7', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190209889.001.0001', '10.1162/daed.2008.137.3.78', '10.1080/03050629.2011.622653', '10.1177/1065912908327228', '10.1111/j.1540-6237.2011.00803.x', '10.1111/1475-6765.12425', '10.1007/s11558-019-09360-2', '10.1111/j.1559-1816.2005.tb02206.x', '10.1111/puar.13012', '10.1177/1012690209356989']",Wiley
10.1111/nana.12571,NATIONS AND NATIONALISM,0603 World History; 0304 Ethnology; 0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,Multiculturalism as a New Form of Nationalism?,[],"AbstractWhat is often described today as neo‐nationalism or nationalist populism today arguably looks like the old nationalism. What is emerging as genuinely new are the identity‐based nationalisms of the centre left, sometimes called “liberal nationalism” or “progressive patriotism.” I offer my own contribution to the latter, which may be called “multicultural nationalism.” I argue that multiculturalism is a mode of integration that does not just emphasise the centrality of minority group identities but argues that integration is incomplete without remaking national identity so that all can have a sense of belonging to it. This multiculturalist approach to national belonging has some relation to liberal nationalism. It, however, makes not just individual rights but minority accommodation a feature of acceptable nationalism. Moreover, accommodation here particularly includes ethno‐religious groups in ways that are difficult for radical regimes of secularism. For these reasons, multicultural nationalism unites the concerns of some of those currently sympathetic to majoritarian nationalism and those who are prodiversity and minority accommodationist in the way that liberal nationalism (with its emphasis on individualism and majoritarianism) does not. It therefore represents the political idea and tendency most likely to offer a feasible alternative rallying point to monocultural nationalism.","[('Tariq Modood', 'Sociology University of Bristol Bristol UK')]","['10.1177/1468796815604558', '10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700', '10.1177/1468796819827406', '10.1111/1467-923X.12326', '10.1093/0199240981.001.0001', '10.3167/9781845454920', '10.1177/1468796818787413', '10.1080/09502380701470791', '10.1111/j.1467-923X.2003.00584.x', '10.1002/9781405165518.wbeosm129', '10.1057/9781137351548_2', '10.1017/CBO9781139177740', '10.1515/9781400820849']",Wiley

This paper aims to develop a strategy for architectural knowledge modeling in order to actively support the built heritage conservation process by fostering collaboration among stakeholders and interoperability between datasets. The integration of two modeling systems, one ontology-based and one in BIM environment, seems to be the right way to meet this objective: the former is rather exhaustive to represent the semantic contents of conservation activities, especially non-geometrical data, the latter is absolutely suitable to represent the logic of the construction, above all geometrical-constructive aspects typical of any architectural organism. Thus, this study proposes a side-by-side approach to synchronize these different ways of representing reality by managing the complexity of cultural heritage on the one hand and of technology tools, such as information systems, on the other. The proposed methodology was tested on the city walls of San Ginesio (Macerata, Italy) and included different steps considering the in-use technologies (notably geomatics and information technologies) as key enablers to acquire, hierarchically order, model and enrich the knowledge of that heritage site. The result is a knowledge-led strategy moving from survey to HBIM implementation, as a way to enhance representation and management in architectural heritage processes.","[('F. Di Stefano', ''), ('A.

Here we present a geographically well-distributed geochemical dataset comprising flood basalt lavas of the Eocene continental LIP to refine the regional volcano-stratigraphy into three distinct magmatic units: (1) the highly alkaline small-volume Akobo Basalt (49.4–46.6 Ma), representing the initial phase of flood basalt volcanism derived from the melting of lithospheric–mantle metasomes; (2) the primitive and spatially restricted Amaro Basalt (45.2–39.8 Ma), representing the early main phase of flood basalt volcanism derived from the melting of the upwelling thermochemical anomaly; and (3) the spatially extensive Gamo–Makonnen magmatic unit (38–28 Ma), representing the mature main phase of flood basalt volcanism that has undergone significant processing within the lithosphere and resulted in relatively homogeneous compositions. The focused intrusion of these main phase magmas over 10 myr preconditioned the African lithosphere for the localization of strain during subsequent episodes of lithospheric stretching. The focusing of strain into the region occupied by this continental LIP may have contributed to the initial extension in SW Ethiopia that is associated with the East African Rift.","[('R.

The principality lay between impartible northern Europe and the partible southwest. Inequality in landholding size is measured, showing an average Gini of 0.615 and substantial variation across communities. Places with relatively larger populations and ones that practiced impartible inheritance had mostly higher wealth inequality.

The data image part of the Pleistocene to recent shelf to slope to basin-floor Giant Foresets Formation in offshore western New Zealand. The MTD created substantive topographic relief and rugosity at the contemporaneous seabed, formed by the presence of a shallow basal detachment surface, and very large (up to 200 m high) intact slide blocks, respectively. Sediments were initially deflected away from high-relief MTD topography and confined in low areas. With time, the MTD was progressively healed by a series of broadly offset-stacked and increasingly unconfined packages comprised of many channel bodies and their distributary complexes. Positive topography formed by the channels and their distributary complexes further modified the seafloor and influenced the location of subsequent sediment deposition. Channel sinuosity increased over time, interpreted as the result of topographic healing and reduced seafloor gradients. The rate of sediment supply is likely to have been non-uniform, reflecting tectonic pulses across the region. Sediments were routed into deep water via slope-confined channels that originated shortly before emplacement of the MTD.","[('Suzanne Bull', 'GNS Science, 1 Fairway Drive, Lower Hutt, New Zealand, 5010'), ('Greg H.

This study identifies a number of moderate (&gt;10 km 3 ) to giant (up to 650 km 3 ) mass transport deposits within the Makassar North Basin Pleistocene–Recent section. The majority of submarine landslides that formed these deposits originated from the Mahakam pro-delta, with the largest skewed to the south. We see clear evidence for ocean-current erosion, lateral transport and contourite deposition across the upper slope. This suggests that the ITF is acting as an along-slope conveyor belt, transporting sediment to the south of the delta, where rapid sedimentation rates and slope oversteepening results in recurring submarine landslides. A frequency for the &gt;100 km 3 failures is tentatively proposed at 0.5 Ma, with smaller events occurring at least every 160 ka. This area is therefore potentially prone to tsunamis generated from these submarine landslides. We identify a disparity between historical fault rupture-triggered tsunamis (located along the Palu-Koro fault zone) and the distribution of mass transport deposits in the subsurface. If these newly identified mass failures are tsunamigenic, they may represent a previously overlooked hazard in the region.","[('Rachel E.

The paper looks at the impact of the mix of sectarianism and nationalism on the formation of state institutions and the impact of the latter on this mix. The flawed export of the Westphalian state system to MENA established the structural context—multiple identities, hybrid states—wherein the two identities compete, overlap, and coexist. Next, the factors that explain varying identity patterns in MENA are surveyed and their likely consequences for state formation; then, reversing the analysis, the impact of state formation and state institutions on the nationalism–sectarianism balance is examined. The Syrian case is briefly discussed in order to illustrate the argument, looking at three periods when the identity balance interacted differently with state formation: pre‐Ba'thist Syria when nationalism eclipsed sectarianism; Ba'thist Syria (1970‐2000) when patrimonial instrumentalization of sectarianism was compensated for by inclusive bureaucratic institutions, populist policies, and nationalist ideology; neo‐liberal Syria under Bashar al‐Asad (2000‐2010) when inclusion shrank, reanimating sectarianism; and civil war Syria (2010‐) when partial state failure fostered exclusionary militant sectarianism at the expense of nationalism.","[('Raymond Hinnebusch', 'School of International Relations, Arts Building St Andrews University St Andrews United Kingdom')]","['10.1057/9780230610347', '10.4324/9781315143798-15', '10.1017/CBO9780511897559.008', '10.1177/0735275115572153', '10.1057/9780230234352', '10.1080/00396338.2014.882157', '10.1017/S0260210598001430', '10.11126/stanford/9780804783019.003.0002', '10.1017/CBO9780511897559', '10.1353/jod.2013.0067', '10.1080/19436149.2010.514470', '10.4324/9781315143798', '10.2307/j.ctt1j2n833.17', '10.1162/002081897550483', '10.1007/s12116-008-9027-7', '10.1163/156913312X638606', '10.1017/CBO9780511598685.004', '10.1017/CBO9780511897559.003', '10.1017/CBO9780511611254', '10.1080/01436597.2015.1015788', '10.1080/00396339308442672', '10.4324/9781315143798-16', '10.2307/421307', '10.1080/00263207008700137', '10.1017/CBO9780511897559.009', '10.1162/isec.2007.31.4.97', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2009.00398.x', '10.1017/CBO9780511490415', '10.1093/esr/jcu078', '10.1515/9781685853907']",Wiley

Given a convex relaxation which over-approximates the non-convex activation functions, we encode the violations of activation functions as a cost function and optimize it with respect to the convex relaxation. The cost function, referred to as the Sum-of-Infeasibilities (SoI), is designed so that its minimum is zero and achieved only if all the activation functions are satisfied. We propose a stochastic procedure, , to efficiently minimize the SoI. An extension to a canonical case-analysis-based complete search procedure can be achieved by replacing the convex procedure executed at each search state with . Extending the complete search with achieves multiple simultaneous goals: 1) it guides the search towards a counter-example; 2) it enables more informed branching decisions; and 3) it creates additional opportunities for bound derivation. An extensive evaluation across different benchmarks and solvers demonstrates the benefit of the proposed techniques. In particular, we demonstrate that SoI significantly improves the performance of an existing complete search procedure. Moreover, the SoI-based implementation outperforms other state-of-the-art complete verifiers. We also show that our technique can efficiently improve upon the perturbation bound derived by a recent adversarial attack algorithm.","[('Haoze Wu', ''), ('Aleksandar Zeljić', ''), ('Guy Katz', ''), ('Clark Barrett', '')]","['10.1145/3314221.3314614', '10.1007/s10107-020-01474-5', '10.1023/A:1020281327116', '10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_4', '10.1007/BF01584074', '10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013240', '10.1609/aaai.v34i04.5729', '10.1017/CBO9780511804441', '10.1201/b10905', '10.1109/SP.2017.49', '10.1080/00031305.1995.10476177', '10.2140/pjm.1955.5.183', '10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19', '10.1109/SP.2018.00058', '10.24963/ijcai.2021/351', '10.1109/MSP.2012.2205597', '10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1', '10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294549', '10.1080/00031305.1998.10480547', '10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5', '10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26', '10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_13', '10.1109/FMCAD.2013.6679409', '10.1201/9781351251389-8', '10.1609/aaai.v34i04.5944', '10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2018.00067', '10.1007/978-3-030-83903-1_5', '10.1145/2490301.2451150', '10.1038/nature16961', '10.1145/3290354', '10.1109/IJCNN.2011.6033395', '10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_2', '10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561956', '10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2808470']",Springer International Publishing

The recent rise of Hong Kong diaspora provides an emerging case of stateless diaspora that introduces new empirical insights into the scholarly literature. Using a mixed‐method research strategy, this study empirically investigates the formation of the Hong Kong diaspora as a ‘historically contingent process’, through which overseas Hongkongers were mobilised during the 2019–20 Anti‐Extradition Bill Movement (critical event) to join global protests (mobilising practices) by diaspora groups and activists (mobilising agents). Achieved transborder outreach across the Global North by mobilising their strong moral and cultural resources, it remains to be seen whether the emerging Hong Kong diaspora will move towards a full‐fledged, sustained identity‐based movement. The case study of Hong Kong diaspora offers new comparative insights and establishes a mixed‐method analytical framework for comparing stateless diaspora worldwide.","[('Brian C. H.

Their effects have been taken as writ through labour market statistics or aggregate measures of gross domestic product. However, by focusing on particular micro-economic spaces, a different story emerges. Using the inner areas of Liverpool as a case-study, this article shows how the city's social and economic problems were underwritten by the decline of the service sector, located around the port. By reading the effects of social and economic change through accounts of the physical environment, it demonstrates how urban decay and dereliction provided material resonance to Liverpool's economic decline. The city's landscape of urban decay and dereliction encompassed the infrastructure of everyday life – housing, roads and even trees – as well as that of economic activity, including the docks and warehouses. Taken together, this article shows how this landscape of urban decay and dereliction came to be constituted as an agent within Liverpool's continued economic decline in the 1970s rather than simply being a reflection of it.","[('Aaron Andrews', '')]","['10.1093/tcbh/hwy010', '10.1093/hwj/dbw022', '10.5040/9781474257398', '10.1017/CHO9781139815024.014', '10.59962/9780774834957', '10.1017/S0963926816000730', '10.1093/tcbh/hwi009', '10.1163/ej.9789004175808.i-382', '10.1017/S0963926816000298', '10.1080/13619469508581356', '10.1080/13619460802439382', '10.1093/ehr/ceu011', '10.1111/hith.10683', '10.1017/S0963926813000734', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199212668.003.0008', '10.1017/S0066622X00001477', '10.1093/tcbh/hwv030']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

As soon as the planetary intruded into history, it became impossible to keep it as one naturalized background. By problematizing the planetary, Dipesh Chakrabarty has forced philosophers, historians and anthropologists to extend pluralism to the very ground on which history was supposed to unfold. Hence Bruno Latour’s attempt at counting the number of “planets” whose attractions are simultaneously being felt today on any political question. Each of his eight planets are defined by the disconnect between where they are situated and where they are imagined to be moving, which means that each planet is led by a different and incommensurable philosophy of history. Such a “fictional planetology” is then discussed by Chakrabarty, who reviews the difficulties historians have had in taking the nonhuman (and hence the planet) as a historical agent and then adds to Latour’s count a new planetary body which further complicates the geopolitical situation. The result of their joint effort is to shift questions of philosophy of history to philosophy of geography.","[('Bruno Latour', 'Emeritus Professor, médialab, Sciences Po Paris France'), ('Dipesh Chakrabarty', 'Lawrence A.

10.1093/ahr/rhaa237,AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,Aztecs Abroad? Uncovering the Early Indigenous Atlantic,[],"Abstract Indigenous people are often seen as static recipients of transatlantic encounter, influencing the Atlantic world only in their parochial interactions with Europeans, but the reality is that thousands of Native Americans crossed the ocean during the sixteenth century, many unwillingly, but some by choice. As diplomats, entertainers, traders, travelers, and, sadly, most often when enslaved, Indigenous people operated consciously within structures that spanned the ocean and created a worldview that was framed in transatlantic terms. Focusing on purposeful travelers of “Aztec” (Central Mexican) origin, this article uses the distinctive context of the 1500s to rewrite our understandings of the Atlantic world. In the turbulent waters of early empire, we can more easily see Native people as purposeful global actors who created and transformed social, economic, political, and intellectual networks, forging not one but many “Indigenous Atlantics.” This is about more than “looking east from Indian country,” or recovering the transatlantic journeys of Native people, important though both those things are. To find a truly “Indigenous Atlantic,” we must reimagine the history of the ocean itself: as a place of Indigenous activity, imagination, and power.","[('Caroline Dodds Pennock', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

The reasons for this are varied: digital historians have often preferred to create scholarship for public audiences, or they have pursued forms of scholarship which do not lend themselves to explicit interpretation. But we contend that digital historians have not had sufficient models of patterns of historical argumentation compatible with digital historical research. In this introduction, we read the articles by Rachel Midura and Leonardo Barleta that appear in this special section, and a series of other articles, in order to show the patterns of historical argumentation that digital historians can pursue. A companion website features versions of the articles by Midura and Barleta, as well as eight additional previously published articles, annotated by their authors to highlight how they developed their historical arguments so they can serve as models for argumentative digital history.","[('Stephen Robertson', ''), ('Lincoln Mullen', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)
10.1093/jsh/shz070,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY,0603 World History,Access to the Trade: Monopoly and Mobility in European Craft Guilds in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries,[],"Abstract One of the standard objections against guilds in the premodern world has been their exclusiveness. Guilds have been portrayed as providing unfair advantages to the children of established masters and locals, over immigrants and other outsiders. Privileged access to certain professions and industries is seen as a source of inequality and a disincentive for technological progress. In this paper, we examine this assumption by studying the composition of guild masters and apprentices from a large sample of European towns and cities from 1600 to 1800, focusing on the share who were children of masters or locals. These data offer an indirect measurement of the strength of guild barriers and, by implication, of their monopolies. We find very wide variation between guilds in practice, but most guild masters and apprentices were immigrants or unrelated locals: openness was much more common than closure, especially in larger centers. Our understanding of guild “monopolies” and exclusivity is in need of serious revision.","[('Maarten Prak', ''), ('Clare Haru Crowston', ''), ('Bert De Munck', ''), ('Christopher Kissane', ''), ('Chris Minns', ''), ('Ruben Schalk', ''), ('Patrick Wallis', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

The non-marine Ness Formation and crest parts of the structure contain negligible calcite cement. This localized calcite cement has led to relatively poor reservoir performance since first oil in 1978, although a new suite of wells has boosted production with plans to keep the field active until 2030. Understanding the origin and distribution of calcite cement would help the development of more realistic reservoir models and boost production rates through optimum well location. We have thus used a suite of techniques, including standard point counting, SEM-EDS mineralogy, BSE microscopy, fluid inclusion thermometry and stable isotope analysis, to develop new and improved models of calcite distribution. Calcite seems to have attributes of both early and late diagenetic cement. A 30–40% intergranular volume in calcite cemented beds seems to support pre-compactional growth but high-temperature fluid inclusions and the presence of primary oil inclusions suggest late growth. Much calcite may have developed early but it seems to have recrystallized, and possibly undergone redistribution, at close to maximum burial or had a late growth event. Calcite cement probably originated as marine-derived micrite, bioclasts or early marine cement but adopted the isotopic characteristics of high-temperature growth as it recrystallized. Quartz grains have corroded outlines in calcite-cemented areas with one sample, with 79% calcite cement, displaying signs of nearly total replacement of quartz grains by calcite. The flank localization of calcite cement remains to be explained, although it could be due to primary depositional factors, early diagenetic loss of calcite from crestal regions or late diagenetic loss of calcite from crestal regions. Controversially, the growth of calcite seems to be associated with quartz dissolution, although the geochemical and petrophysical cause of this remains obscure. Diagenetic loss of quartz from sandstones cannot easily be explained by conventional modelling approaches and yet seems to be an important phenomenon in Heather sandstones.","[('Richard H.

The analytical workflows include heavy mineral separation using a wide grain-size window (15–355 μ) analysed through integrated optical analysis, Raman spectroscopy, QEMSCAN microscopy and U–Pb dating of detrital zircon. Upper Jurassic–Cretaceous silt-sized sediments from the Mandawa Basin of central-southern Tanzania have been selected for the scope of this research. Raman-aided heavy mineral analysis reveals garnet and apatite to be the most common minerals together with durable zircon, tourmaline and subordinate rutile. Accessory but diagnostic phases are titanite, staurolite, epidote and monazite. Etch pits on garnet and cockscomb features on staurolite document the significant effect of diagenesis on the pristine heavy mineral assemblage. Multivariate statistical analysis highlights a close association among durable minerals (zircon, tourmaline and rutile, ZTR) while garnet and apatite plot alone reflecting independence between the three groups of variables with garnet increasing in Jurassic samples. Raman data for garnet end-member analysis document different associations between Jurassic (richer in A, Bi and Bii types) and Cretaceous (dominant A, Ci and Cii types) samples. U–Pb dating of detrital zircon and their statistical integration with the above-mentioned datasets provide further insights into changes in provenance and/or drainage systems. Metamorphic rocks of the early and late Pan-African orogeny terranes of the Mozambique Belt and those of the Irumide Belt acted as main source of sediment during the Jurassic. Cretaceous sediments record a broadening of the drainage system reaching as far as the Usagran–Ubendian Belt and the Tanzanian Archean Craton.","[('L.

10.3138/chr.2019-0005,CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,A History of Oil Spills on Long-Distance Pipelines in Canada,[],"Leaks and spills have been endemic on long-distance oil pipelines in Canada since the mid-twentieth century. Evidence from the National Energy Board (neb) pipeline incident reports reveals a track record of thousands of spills totalling millions of litres of oil across the country. What causes onshore oil spills? Why do they occur? Where have they occurred? What have been the environmental consequences of these incidents? This article explores the history of onshore oil spills on federally regulated long-distance pipelines since the mid-twentieth century. It argues that oil pipeline spills are an endemic characteristic of complex enviro-technical systems built primarily for economic efficiency rather than environmental protection. Based on the analysis of incident reports submitted to the neb, the article finds that, while frequent, onshore oil spills in Canada have been variable in scale and have had a wide range of potential adverse environmental effects, depending on location, product type, and volume. The causes of such spills have also been variable, conforming to no obvious pattern over time. Instead, oil pipeline spills have occurred most often in an unpredictable fashion, posing great challenges for policy development. These spills have also represented a proportionally small fraction of the total oil delivered on Canada’s long-distance pipelines, but, in absolute terms, this has meant the uncontrolled release of many millions of litres of oil into the environment.","[('Sean Kheraj', 'Canadian and environmental history at York University')]","['10.7551/mitpress/8157.001.0001', '10.7551/mitpress/9780262035774.001.0001', '10.4159/9780674970731', '10.1515/9780773599529-012', '10.59962/9780774833066', '10.7551/mitpress/9780262036511.001.0001', '10.1515/9781552385418', '10.1139/er-2017-0003', '10.2307/890588']",University of Toronto Press Inc.

10.1111/1468-0424.12497,GENDER AND HISTORY,0603 World History; 0303 Sociology,'Rejoice! Your wombs will not beget slaves!' Marronnage as Reproductive Justice in Colonial Haiti,[],"ABSTRACTThis paper explores the possible existence of organic reproductive justice actions among enslaved mothers and pregnant women in colonial Haiti (Saint Domingue) with specific focus on how marronnage – escape from slavery – provided them opportunities to exert power over their lives, bodies and biological reproduction. Reproductive justice is defined as the complete well‐being of women and girls, based on their human right to decide when and how to have – or not have – children, and to parent existing children in safe and sustainable communities. The conditions of enslavement in Haiti were particularly detrimental to women's control over their fertility and overall reproductive health as birth rates remained so low that the enslaved population could not reproduce itself; however, findings from an underutilized archival roster containing demographic information on the only formally recognized community of maroons from colonial Haiti, the Maniel, indicate that the child‐woman ratio among fugitive women was over twice as high as their counterparts who remained enslaved on plantations. Subversive reading of runaway slave advertisements also suggests that choosing to abscond was a rare but effective mechanism for women to achieve reproductive justice by exercising agency over their lives and protecting their childbearing capabilities. By highlighting motherhood during a state of fugitivity in one of the most economically prosperous slave societies in modern history, this paper can help establish historical precedent for contemporary reproductive justice claims. Moreover, maroon mothers' organic acts of reproductive justice have important implications for the study of how black women resist structures of racial capitalism that negatively impact their reproductive health and other areas of their lives.","[('Crystal Eddins', '')]",[],Wiley

The state-of-the-art proof system that allows for compact proof certificates ispropagation redundancy(PR). However, the only existing method to validate proofs in this system with a formally verified tool requires a transformation to a weaker proof system, which can result in a significant blowup in the size of the proof and increased proof validation time. This paper describes the first approach to formally verify PR proofs on a succinct representation; we present (i) a newLinear PR(LPR) proof format, (ii) a tool to efficiently convert PR proofs into LPR format, and (iii) , a verified LPR proof checker developed in CakeML. The LPR format is backwards compatible with the existing LRAT format, but extends the latter with support for the addition of PR clauses. Moreover, is verified using CakeML ’s binary code extraction toolchain, which yields correctness guarantees for its machine code (binary) implementation. This further distinguishes our clausal proof checker from existing ones because unverified extraction and compilation tools are removed from its trusted computing base. We experimentally show that LPR provides efficiency gains over existing proof formats and that the strong correctness guarantees are obtained without significant sacrifice in the performance of the verified executable.","[('Yong Kiam Tan', ''), ('Marijn J.

It focuses on three women, Elizabeth Dale, Rebecka Duteil and Mary Goodal, who navigated the EIC, parliament and the courts in seventeenth‐century London to try to secure their inheritance from husbands and siblings. It offers a fresh perspective on early modern women's public lives by focusing on a wide array of agentic strategies that women employed in their encounters with various institutions. Using a range of sources, including company records, petitions, court depositions and wills, it argues that exploring women's interactions with the EIC, especially in their role as adversaries, enriches understandings of women's agency in early modern England. This article suggests that such a lens can further nuance how we understand the inherent tensions of early modern women's public lives: as inflected by global as well as local contexts and shaped by conflict as well as collaboration.","[('Aske Laursen Brock', ''), ('Misha Ewen', '')]",[],Wiley

'Whore' Stigma and the East/West Politics of Race, Sexuality and Gender",[],"Drawing on two ethnographic projects, one among Russian-speaking women engaged in commercial sex, the other among young Russian-speaking migrants in Finland, we interrogate how the construct of Eastern European female body is positioned in relation to the norm of (Western) Europeanness and white femininity. We show how Russian-speaking migrant women in Finland learn of their ‘Russianness’ and ‘Easternness’ through the circulation of the ‘whore’ stigma. We analyse these processes of racialisation and sexualisation in the context of the Finnish national project based on gender equality and women’s liberation norms. While normative Western Europeanness has recently been constructed through emancipated sexuality and the exclusion of non-Western Others as sexually repressed, the bodies of Russian-speaking women are perceived as sexually excessive and in need of toning down. Focusing on the (self-)policing of Russian-speaking migrant women’s bodies and the ways they navigate acceptable and unacceptable forms of gendered self-presentation, we demonstrate how these women are construed as not emancipated enough and hence not quite white. The article thereby contributes to understanding hierarchies of whiteness within the East/West dynamics of race as they pertain to gender and sexuality.","[('Daria Krivonos', ''), ('Anastasia Diatlova', '')]",[],Intersections

In particular, the current techniques typically analyze executions by unfolding transitions one step at a time, and the slow growth of execution length prevents detection of deep counterexamples before the tool reaches its limits on computations. We propose a novel model-checking algorithm that is capable of both proving unbounded safety and finding long counterexamples. The idea is to use Craig interpolation to guide the creation of symbolic abstractions ofexponentially longer sequences of transitions. Our experimental analysis shows that on unsafe benchmarks with deep counterexamples our implementation can detect faulty executions that are at least an order of magnitude longer than those detectable by the state-of-the-art tools.","[('Martin Blicha', ''), ('Grigory Fedyukovich', ''), ('Antti E.

Detailed geological mapping, stratigraphic reconstruction and outcrop description, supported by structural analysis, allowed the architectural characterization of the TGIC. The complex is described as two main stratigraphically constrained intervals: (1) a lower interval (250 m thick) emplaced into clay-rich mudrock, consisting dominantly of sills with stepped and multilayered geometry; and (2) an upper interval (200 m thick) characterized by injection breccia and large wing-like intrusions ( c. 600 m width × 100 m high) emplaced within predominantly biosiliceous mudrock strata. The intrusions in both intervals were derived from turbiditic channel fills intensely modified by sand fluidization. Sandstone intrusions and fractures affecting host strata are dominantly oriented sub-parallel to the basin axis striking between NW–SE and N–S, mainly dipping to NE and forming asymmetric saucer-shaped intrusions, suggesting structurally driven hydraulic fracturing and sand emplacement. The absence of a deep aquifer and potential sand sources underlying the complex suggests a lateral contribution of fluid flow. The TGIC occurs at a scale similar to injection complexes recognized in the subsurface and is a valuable reservoir analogue for hydrocarbon accumulations associated with sand injectites.","[('G.

10.1093/pastj/gtab015,PAST & PRESENT,0603 World History,"The Pervasiveness of Lordship (Italy, 1050-1500)*",[],"Abstract The impact of medieval lordship on the society it dominated has not received the attention it deserves. This article stresses the need to look at lordship from the bottom up, making an effort to understand how much and in which ways lordship weighed on the life of subjects, by developing the notion of its ‘pervasiveness’. Such a concept is arguably the most effective if we want to evaluate how seigneurial power was more, or less, able and willing to deeply influence the people subject to it. It highlights that in the world of lordship there was a disconnect (or at least potentially) between political power and socio-economic domination. Which factors enabled lordships to become pervasive, and which lords, from which regions, were best equipped with these characteristics? Using the influential French historiographical framework as a starting point, the article considers as case studies a set of signorie in several Italian regions. It highlights the differences between the great territorial lordships of the counts of the Kingdom of Sicily, the barons of Rome and the lords of Lombardy, on the one side, and the innumerable knightly lordships at a lower level on the other. The use of pervasiveness helps us to re-conceptualize lordship itself with different criteria.","[('Sandro Carocci', 'Università di Roma ‘Tor Vergata’ , Italy')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

The plate formed by Early Cretaceous to Miocene amalgamation of four crustal types: the Caribbean Large Igneous Province oceanic plateau; the Chortis continental block; the related Great Arc of the Caribbean and Siuna/Mesquito Composite Oceanic Terranes island arc blocks; and the Colombian and Venezuelan basin oceanic crust. We characterize each terrane through interpretation of surface geology, 62 000-line-km of 2D seismic reflection data, 366 seismic refraction stations, 47 wells, 74 basement samples, 2D forward modelling, magnetic and gravity anomaly grids, and integration of previous studies. Basins overlying island arc crust are small, fault-bounded and deep, while on continental crust, they are broader and shallower. Strongly flexed oceanic and oceanic plateau crust along amagmatic subduction zones on the southern and northeastern edges of the Caribbean plate produce the largest and deepest sediment-filled basins. Areas of proven hydrocarbon source rocks and mapped seeps are associated with continental and island arc terranes in the western Caribbean plate, while organically-rich, but immature, Late Cretaceous source rocks occur across the more elevated areas of the central and eastern Caribbean plate interior.","[('Sean Romito', ''), ('Paul Mann', '')]","['10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2009.10.003', '10.1029/JZ066i011p03793', '10.1130/G46708.1', '10.1130/B35037.1', '10.1029/2019TC005741', '10.1029/2002JB002040', '10.3133/ofr02414', '10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2015.02.008', '10.1306/13531950M1083653', '10.1029/93TC01185', '10.1016/S1874-5997(99)80049-5', '10.1306/13531935M1083641', '10.1029/2018JB016369', '10.1016/0040-1951(88)90122-9', '10.1130/0016-7606(1993)105<1321:DHOTWC>2.3.CO;2', '10.1130/0016-7606(1988)100<0534:UCSOTW>2.3.CO;2', '10.1111/j.1365-246X.1979.tb01031.x', '10.1016/0264-8172(87)90022-5', '10.1016/j.epsl.2018.07.020', '10.1146/annurev.ea.16.050188.001221', '10.1029/94JB02770', '10.1306/12081717221', '10.1306/13531951M1083654', '10.1029/2007JB005373', '10.2973/odp.proc.sr.120.202.1992', '10.1190/1.2837309', '10.1016/j.tecto.2017.04.029', '10.1029/JB088iB08p06449', '10.1111/j.1747-5457.1992.tb00873.x', '10.1016/0012-821X(77)90003-6', '10.1029/TC005i004p00703', '10.1029/JB086iB09p07901', '10.1016/S1874-5997(99)80053-7', '10.1130/0091-7613(1998)026<1043:DOTCRO>2.3.CO;2', '10.1016/S1874-5997(99)80054-9', '10.1016/0025-3227(91)90236-W', '10.1016/j.lithos.2018.12.021', '10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.01.004', '10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2010.01.016', '10.1029/2006JB004323', '10.1016/j.lithos.2013.07.006', '10.1016/j.lithos.2016.03.013', '10.1130/0016-7606(1954)65[165:GAASOT]2.0.CO;2', '10.1130/0016-7606(1957)68[897:GIITEC]2.0.CO;2', '10.1029/JZ065i012p04087', '10.1080/00206814.2015.1027747', '10.1016/0040-1951(70)90041-7', '10.1016/0040-1951(71)90011-4', '10.1190/INT-2016-0176.1', '10.1029/2019GC008340', '10.1029/94TC00923', '10.1029/JB088iB12p10585', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.11.001', '10.1016/j.lithos.2007.08.003', '10.1144/SP328.14', '10.1029/1999GC000020', '10.1029/JB082i030p04861', '10.1038/scientificamerican1185-116', '10.1016/S0012-821X(98)00139-3', '10.1130/GES01421.1', '10.1111/j.1365-246X.1974.tb05423.x', '10.1016/S0040-1951(98)00067-5', '10.1130/0016-7606(1999)111<1581:ANPTMO>2.3.CO;2', '10.1029/2011TC002918', '10.1029/ME001p0041', '10.1029/1998JB900091', '10.1111/j.1747-5457.1991.tb00312.x', '10.1046/j.1365-246x.2000.00059.x', '10.1016/0040-1951(94)00268-E', '10.1046/j.1365-246X.1998.00489.x', '10.1016/S0040-1951(97)00103-0', '10.1002/2017GC007280', '10.1016/j.tecto.2017.11.026', '10.1016/0012-821X(76)90145-X', '10.1144/0016-76492010-067', '10.1093/petrology/egt025', '10.1130/0016-7606(1952)63[777:SRMITA]2.0.CO;2', '10.1029/JB082i005p00803', '10.1130/0091-7613(1977)5<105:PAGOMR>2.0.CO;2', '10.1016/0025-3227(80)90069-9', '10.1029/TC001i002p00179', '10.1144/SP328.1', '10.1016/0040-1951(88)90262-4', '10.1007/978-1-4684-8535-6_7', '10.2973/dsdp.proc.15.122.1973', '10.1086/317953', '10.1029/TC009i005p01037', '10.1016/0012-821X(86)90046-4', '10.1029/JB093iB03p02141', '10.1016/j.orggeochem.2006.07.012', '10.1144/SP431.3', '10.1306/05111816516', '10.1016/j.revmic.2015.02.002', '10.1126/science.1258213', '10.1029/95TC01928', '10.1016/0012-821X(88)90006-4', '10.2973/odp.proc.sr.165.029.2000', '10.1016/S0012-821X(97)00214-8', '10.1130/0016-7606(2001)113<0256:ARATVG>2.0.CO;2', '10.1016/0012-821X(81)90149-7', '10.1306/12191817068', '10.1007/978-1-4684-8535-6_1', '10.1126/science.187.4179.834', '10.1002/2015EA000107', '10.1111/j.1365-246X.1975.tb00632.x', '10.1130/0091-7613(1988)016<0631:CSOAAW>2.3.CO;2', '10.1029/92JB01749', '10.1306/01031110106']",Geological Society of London

As scheduling non-determinism creates exponentially large spaces of thread interleavings, SMC attempts to partition this space into equivalence classes and explore only a few representatives from each class. The efficiency of this approach depends on two factors: (a) the coarseness of the partitioning, and (b) the time to generate representatives in each class. For this reason, the search for coarse partitionings that are efficiently explorable is an active research challenge.In this work we present$${\text {RVF-SMC}}$$RVF-SMC, a new SMC algorithm that uses a novelreads-value-from (RVF)partitioning. Intuitively, two interleavings are deemed equivalent if they agree on the value obtained in each read event, and read events induce consistent causal orderings between them. The RVF partitioning is provably coarser than recent approaches based on Mazurkiewicz and “reads-from” partitionings. Our experimental evaluation reveals that RVF is quite often a very effective equivalence, as the underlying partitioning is exponentially coarser than other approaches. Moreover,$${\text {RVF-SMC}}$$RVF-SMCgenerates representatives very efficiently, as the reduction in the partitioning is often met with significant speed-ups in the model checking task.","[('Pratyush Agarwal', ''), ('Krishnendu Chatterjee', ''), ('Shreya Pathak', ''), ('Andreas Pavlogiannis', ''), ('Viktor Toman', '')]","['10.1145/263699.263717', '10.1007/3-540-60761-7', '10.1145/1273442.1250785', '10.1145/3434325', '10.1007/s100090050035', '10.1007/3-540-56922-7_34', '10.1007/3-540-17906-2_30', '10.1145/1040305.1040315', '10.1145/2535838.2535845', '10.1007/978-3-319-96142-2_22', '10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_14', '10.1007/3-540-56922-7_36', '10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_26', '10.1145/3360599', '10.1145/3158119', '10.1145/3360576', '10.1145/3360550', '10.1145/2737924.2737975', '10.1137/S0097539794279614', '10.1145/3276505', '10.1007/s00236-016-0275-0', '10.1145/3314221.3314609', '10.1145/3158105', '10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_16', '10.1145/3371085', '10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_21', '10.1145/2806886']",Springer International Publishing

Preconditioning of the seafloor for failure results from high sedimentation rates coupled with slope over-steepening, under-consolidation and abundant biogenic gas production. Catastrophic failure of production platforms and pipelines due to seafloor displacement during infrequent large hurricanes such as Camille in 1969 and Ivan in 2004, point to cyclical loading of the seafloor by waves as a primary movement trigger. Due to data limitations, the role of smaller storms and background oceanographic processes in driving seafloor movement has remained largely unconstrained but these are thought to contribute to significant seafloor change. With the aid of new high-resolution multibeam mapping and seismic reflection profiling across sections of the MRDF, several moving features within the deforming delta-front environment are investigated and potential hazards to infrastructure installed and adjacent to the region are discussed. Via repeat mapping surveys of selected areas and records of changing shipwreck locations, we highlight significant seafloor displacement across annual to decadal timescales.

10.1111/hith.12268,HISTORY AND THEORY,0603 World History,NATURAL HISTORIES FOR THE ANTHROPOCENE: KOSELLECK'S THEORIES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A HISTORY OF LIFETIMES,[],"ABSTRACTIn this article, I offer a rereading of Reinhart Koselleck that puts his work at the center of ongoing debates about how to write histories that can account for humanity's changed and changing relationship to our natural environment—or, in geological terms, to our planet. This involves engaging with the urgent realities of climate crisis and the geological agency of humans, which, in current discourse, are often designated by the concept of the Anthropocene. This article asks whether Koselleck's essays from the 1970s and after contain ideas, arguments, theories, and methods that may prove useful in collapsing “the age‐old humanist distinction between natural history and human history,” to use Dipesh Chakrabarty's phrase. Indeed, the unlikeliness of providing a positive answer to this question is itself an important motivation for raising it. The other motivation is the supposition that the difficulties in bridging the gap between human and natural history fundamentally has to do with time and, more specifically, with the divergent temporal frameworks governing different historiographies, which are in part practiced in natural sciences such as geology, biology, and meteorology. The first part of this article discusses what one could call Koselleck's temporal anthropocentrism, which was handed down in German historicism and hermeneutics from the eighteenth century onward in the shape of what I call the Vitruvian Man of Time. In Koselleck's work, this superimposition of the human onto the multiple lifetimes of the planet is most clearly expressed in his claim about the “denaturalization” of history at the beginning of modernity. The second part of this article observes a shift in Koselleck's engagement with nature beginning in the 1980s; this shift is presented in terms of a “renaturalization.” The theoretical and methodological tool for this re‐entanglement of the times of history and the times of nature is his theory of multiple times. Originally limited to the human, this theory rises to the task of including an increasing number of natural times that are no longer perceived as stable, static, and slow but as continuously accelerating due to “human use.” In conclusion, this article suggests that Koselleck's work offers the framework for a theory of “lifetimes” that can replace modernist history as platform for writing new natural histories for the future.","[('HELGE JORDHEIM', 'University of Oslo')]",[],Wiley

After offering a characterization of the post-2012 “state-civilization” discourse from above, I examine how ordinary people imagine Russia as a “state-civilization.” Interview narratives of inclusion into the nation are found to overlap with state discourse on three main lines: (1) ethno-nationalism is rejected, and Russia is imagined to be a unique, harmonious multi-ethnic space in which the Russians (russkie) lead without repressing the others; (2) Russia’s multinationalism is remembered in myths of peaceful interactions between Russians (russkie) and indigenous ethnic groups (korennyye narodi) across the imperial and Soviet past; (3) Russian culture and language are perceived as the glue that holds together a unified category of nationhood. Interview narratives on exclusion deviate from state discourse in two key areas: attitudes to the North Caucasus reveal the geopolitical-security, post-imperial aspect of the “state-civilization” identity, while stances toward non-Slavic migrants in city spaces reveal a degree of “cultural nationalism” that, while sharing characteristics with those of Western Europe, is also based on Soviet-framed notions of normality. Overall, the article contributes to debates on how Soviet legacies and Russia’s post-imperial consciousness play out in the context of the “pro-Putin consensus.”","[('Matthew Blackburn', '')]","['10.1080/13569319808420771', '10.1080/10758216.2016.1225264', '10.1080/09668136.2011.547693', '10.2753/RUP1061-1940480103', '10.1080/1060586X.2015.1076959', '10.1177/107780049500100103', '10.2753/RUP1061-1940500503', '10.1080/09668136.2014.986965', '10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0012', '10.1016/j.euras.2010.04.001', '10.1080/00905992.2014.923390', '10.1017/CBO9780511894732.010', '10.1080/09668136.2014.988999', '10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0003', '10.1515/9781474433877-007', '10.1080/21567689.2015.1068167', '10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0010', '10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0011', '10.1016/B978-008044910-4.00420-X', '10.4324/9780203960899', '10.1111/ssqu.12188', '10.1177/0010414002035005003', '10.1515/9781474433877-016', '10.1515/9781474433877-008', '10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0006', '10.1057/9780230282940_5', '10.1162/DAED_a_00437', '10.1057/9780230282940_6', '10.1080/0143659042000322937']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

This study shows that, given limited historical data, median incomes are most appropriate for measuring welfare and inequality, while urban unskilled wages can be used to test dualist models of development. We present new estimates of these series for Mexico from 1800 to 2015 and find that both have historically failed to keep up with aggregate growth: GDP per worker is now over eight times higher than in the nineteenth century, while unskilled urban real wages are only 2.2 times higher, and national median incomes only 2.0 times higher. From the perspective of inequality and social welfare, our findings confirm that there is no automatic positive relationship between economic growth and rising living standards for the majority. From the perspective of development, we argue that these findings are explained by a dual economy model incorporating Lewis's assumption of a reserve army of labour, and we explain why the decline in inequality predicted by Kuznets has not occurred.","[('Ingrid Bleynat', ""King's College London""), ('Amílcar E.

The digitalization of the process for building permit (involving the use of 3D information systems) is seen as a priority in a wide part of the world. Since it is a very multidisciplinary use case, involving a variety of stakeholders tackling complex issues and topics, some of them joined their efforts and skills in the European Network for Digital Building Permit. The initial activity of the network, after a review of on-going experiences, was a workshop to share knowledge about the topics involved and to identify the main ambitions of the network with respect to three pillars (i.e. Process – Rules and Requirements – Technology) and the related requirements. It was achieved through a collective brainstorming activity guided by digital tools, whose results were further analysed in a post-processing phase. Such results are presented in this paper and will be the base for planning the future network activity.","[('F. Noardo', ''), ('G. Malacarne', ''), ('S. Mastrolembo Ventura', ''), ('L. C.

The question that colonial governments faced during the nineteenth century was on how to finance public works. Focusing specifically on irrigation works and the rivers of southern India, this article shows how different experiments were attempted, including raising capital and labour from local communities as well as corporate investment in irrigation works through London capital markets. The article argues that by the latter part of the nineteenth century, a definitive answer had emerged, i.e. irrigation projects on rivers would be financed through state debt. An enormous body of scholarship in Britain and India debated the relationship between public works and public debt. This article rethinks this scholarship as a technological and environmental history. The article argues that colonial modes of raising capital were dependent on speculating on Indian rivers. Historiography wise, in contrast to scholarship which takes for granted the role of the state in building large dams, it suggests that the emergence of the state as the builder of large dams was part of a more fundamental relationship between rivers, technology, and colonial capital that emerged in the nineteenth century.","[('ADITYA RAMESH', '')]","['10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199590414.001.0001', '10.1177/0021909610388015', '10.1017/9781108348867', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190648664.001.0001', '10.1111/j.1478-0542.2006.00336.x', '10.1017/S0026749X00008167', '10.4324/9781315677798', '10.1007/s12685-018-0226-5', '10.1017/CBO9780511993398', '10.1177/001946469603300102', '10.2307/3516353', '10.1111/j.1471-0366.2009.00262.x', '10.1515/9781400835072', '10.1163/15685209-12341472', '10.1177/0257643017736402', '10.1086/530931', '10.1017/CHOL9780521563192', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195682175.001.0001', '10.1093/past/123.1.141', '10.1177/025764300301900103', '10.1525/california/9780520285293.001.0001', '10.1057/978-1-137-45740-0_5', '10.1111/anti.12216', '10.1017/S0020859014000170', '10.1093/shm/hkq112']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

An Essay,[],"Abstract Until now, the relatively quiet transition from traditional Graeco-Roman religion to Christianity has gone unexplained. In dialogue with James Rives and Jörg Rüpke, I argue that Christianity made better use than its religious competition of long-term trends in the Roman Empire, such as expanding literacy, the rejection of sacrifice, the movement toward monotheism, and the closing of the distance between gods and their faithful. The growing skepticism within the city elites regarding the credibility of its traditional religion, the decrease in investments in its material side, and the strength of the Christian organizations were additional factors together with contingent events, such as Constantine’s victory and his long rule.","[('Jan N.

10.1093/tcbh/hwaa006,TWENTIETH CENTURY BRITISH HISTORY,0603 World History,Going Places or Out of Place? Representations of Mobile Girls and Young Women in Late-1950s and 1960s Britain,[],"Abstract Spatial mobilities are a neglected dimension of the historiography of post-war youth and yet, as this article argues, in the late 1950s and 1960s, mobilities became integral to a redefinition of young femininity. Examining media targeting girls and young women, as well as national newspapers and women’s magazines, this article explores the popularization of the idea that girls in their teens and early twenties were on the move and that particular kinds of mobility were a feature of modern girlhood. Whether out and about, travelling or migrating to cities, mobilities were often portrayed as empowering girls and facilitating transitions to adulthood; for these reasons, girls were encouraged to embrace opportunities to be going places, even if this meant challenging personal boundaries. This empowering new ideal came at a cost: youth, and the passage to adulthood, became riskier for girls. Only a thin line separated going places from out of place, as the most transformative mobilities took girls away from the parental home and other forms of adult supervision. There were long-established dangers posed by predatory men, but also new ones posed by going it alone—sexual and domestic exploitation, loneliness; risky mobilities were often less about travel than arriving someplace else. Financial resources helped safeguard girls, but survival increasingly depended on personal resources. Mobilities became a new axis of social differentiation, dividing the girls who were going places, literally and in terms of social status and cultural capital, from those who were out of place or stuck in place.","[('Penny Tinkler', 'University of Manchester, UK')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Go differentiates itself from other imperative languages by offering structural subtyping and lightweight concurrency through goroutines with message-passing communication. This combination of features poses interesting challenges for static verification, most prominently the combination of a mutable heap and advanced concurrency primitives.We present Gobra, a modular, deductive program verifier for Go that proves memory safety, crash safety, data-race freedom, and user-provided specifications. Gobra is based on separation logic and supports a large subset of Go. Its implementation translates an annotated Go program into the Viper intermediate verification language and uses an existing SMT-based verification backend to compute and discharge proof obligations.","[('Felix A.

Here, we evaluate the influence of free gas on the soil's shear strength and submarine slope failures in areas with gassy soils based on an extensive literature review. We identify two potential destabilization mechanisms: gas bubbles in the pore space lead to a reduced shear strength of the soil and/or gas induces excess pore pressures that consequently reduce the effective stress in the soil. Our evaluation of the reported mechanical and hydraulic behaviour of gassy sediments indicates that the unfavourable impact of entrapped gas on a soil's shearing resistance is not sufficient to trigger large-scale slope failures. Liquefaction failure due to high gas pressures is, however, a viable scenario in coarse-grained soils. Transferring the gas influence on the soil mechanical behaviour to constitutive models is identified as the most important prerequisite for a successful future analysis of slope stability.","[('P.

As in many countries, in The Netherlands governmental organisations are acquiring 3D city models to support their public tasks. However, this is still being done within individual organisation, resulting in differences in 3D city models within one country and sometimes covering the same area: i.e. differences in data structure, height references used, update cycle, data quality, use of the 3D data etc. In addition, often only large governmental organisations can afford investing in 3D city models (and the required knowledge) and not small organisations, like small municipalities. To address this problem, the Dutch Kadaster is collaborating with the 3D Geoinformation research group at TU Delft to generate and disseminate a 3D city model covering the whole of the Netherlands and to do this in a sustainable manner, i.e. with an implementation that ensures periodical updates and that aligns with the 3D city models of other governmental organisations, such as large cities.

10.1093/ahr/rhac012,AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,Fiduciary Colonialism Annuities and Native Dispossession in the Early United States,[],"Abstract Federal officials in the early United States built an empire by purchase. But rather than hand over lump sums for Native lands, officials offered annual payments, or annuities. This article traces annuities’ material evolution from payments in goods to high-powered money—especially specie—and their financial evolution from straightforward congressional outlays to interest accrued on investments held in trust. Annuities originated as devices that could permit territorial expansion within considerable military-fiscal constraints. But once in use, they became potent instruments of federal power, shoring up officials’ capacity to intrude on Native economies, wrench further territorial transfers, and channel Indigenous wealth as capital for the very infrastructural projects that spread US settlement. Overall, annuities and the trust funds into which they evolved anchored a strategy of dispossession I call fiduciary colonialism: a mode of territorial acquisition and population management carried out through the expansion of administrative control over Native peoples’ wealth. In the face of federal claims to financial superiority, Indigenous peoples did not wither into wardship. Rather, they engaged trusteeship with their own futures in mind, applying annuities and trusts toward social institutions that would allow their nations to survive the ordeal of dispossession.","[('Emilie Connolly', 'Assistant Professor, Brandeis University')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

This paper examines the benefits and challenges from stakeholders' experiences and perspectives (business students, start-ups and universities). The authors focus on the entrepreneurial values obtained by exploring start-up processes, culture and work environments.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses qualitative research with a case study approach by applying experiential learning. The objects of this research are students of the School of Business and Management and start-ups in Indonesia. This study divides the pilot program of internship at start-ups into three stages, designing process, execution and evaluation. The analysis technique uses an interpretive approach from interviews and observations of internships based on experiential learning.FindingsThe results showed that the internship program at start-ups in this study has benefits for all major stakeholders, especially students. The results of student learning experiences show that start-ups' characteristics such as a creative work environment, egalitarian work culture and dynamic workflow flexibility can increase their professional and moral values.Research limitations/implicationsThis study has several limitations, including the internship program designed in this study, which is still raw and has several shortcomings. Time series in testing experiential learning is another limitation.

The new generation of CSs employs the Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) paradigm by implementing novel standards such as the ISO 15118. This standard enables high-level communication between the vehicle and the charging column, helps manage the charge smartly, and simplifies the payment phase. This novel charging paradigm, which connects the Smart Grid to external networks (e.g., EVs and CSs), has not been thoroughly examined yet. Therefore, it may lead to dangerous vulnerability surfaces and new research challenges.In this paper, we presentEVExchange, the first attack to steal energy during a charging session in a V2G communication: i.e., charging the attacker’s car while letting the victim pay for it. Furthermore, if reverse charging flow is enabled, the attacker can even sell the energy available on the victim’s car! Thus, getting the economic profit of this selling, and leaving the victim with a completely discharged battery. We developed a virtual and a physical testbed in which we validate the attack and prove its effectiveness in stealing the energy. To prevent the attack, we propose a lightweight modification of the ISO 15118 protocol to include a distance bounding algorithm. Finally, we validated the countermeasure on our testbeds. Our results show that the proposed countermeasure can identify all the relay attack attempts while being transparent to the user.","[('Mauro Conti', ''), ('Denis Donadel', ''), ('Radha Poovendran', ''), ('Federico Turrin', '')]","['10.1007/978-3-030-05195-2_38', '10.1109/MNET.001.1900348', '10.1007/s00450-017-0342-y', '10.1007/3-540-48285-7_30', '10.1145/3565268', '10.1145/3339252.3339269', '10.1145/3422337.3447829', '10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160477', '10.1109/JSAC.2006.874404', '10.1016/j.epsr.2010.08.007', '10.1109/CNSM.2015.7367387', '10.1007/978-3-642-16822-2_4', '10.1145/3407023.3407066', '10.1016/j.cose.2009.06.001', '10.1109/CCST.2014.6987031', '10.1145/2517968.2517971', '10.1109/RFID.2014.6810722', '10.1109/ICITCS.2014.7021815', '10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497830', '10.1007/978-3-030-04864-8_3', '10.1016/j.trb.2017.01.020', '10.1145/3485832.3485920', '10.1109/TSG.2010.2090910', '10.1016/j.epsr.2020.106695', '10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3031979', '10.1145/2766498.2766504', '10.1016/B978-0-444-53565-8.00020-8', '10.1109/VPPC.2015.7353006', '10.1109/FSKD.2012.6234155']",Springer International Publishing

Nowadays 3D city models have become an essential part of 3D GIS environments and they can be used in many applications and analyses in urban areas. The conventional 3D building reconstruction methods depend heavily on the data quality and source; and manual efforts are still needed for generating the object models. Several tasks in photogrammetry and remote sensing have been revolutionized by using deep learning (DL) methods, such as image segmentation, classification, and 3D reconstruction. In this study, we provide a review on the state-of-the-art machine learning and in particular the DL methods for 3D building reconstruction for the purpose of city modelling using EO data. This is the first review with a focus on object model generation based on the DL methods and EO data. A brief overview of the recent building reconstruction studies with DL is also given. We have investigated the different DL architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and the combinations of conventional approaches with DL in this paper and reported their advantages and disadvantages. An outlook on the future developments of 3D building modelling based on DL is also presented.","[('M. Buyukdemircioglu', ''), ('S. Kocaman', ''), ('M. Kada', '')]",[],Copernicus GmbH

Drawing on national survey data from just after the November election, we find Christian nationalism and perceptions of anti‐Christian discrimination are strong predictors that (1) Americans feel “religious freedom” was an important factor influencing their vote and (2) that they ranked it the single greatest factor influencing their vote. In contrast, the perception that LGT persons are not discriminated against also predicts viewing religious freedom as important, as does a perception of anti‐Semitism, but never perceptions of anti‐atheist or anti‐Muslim discrimination. Findings suggest conservative Christian supremacism, fear of (Judeo‐)Christian persecution and belief that LGT persons are privileged are ideological antecedents of votes for “religious freedom.”","[('Samuel L.

The AHDI shows substantial gains in world human development since 1870, although significant room for improvement still remains. The AHDI spread unevenly until 1960, in absolute terms, and up to 1929 in relative ones, and reversed this trend thereafter. The main relative gain went to world countries’ middle class, but the main absolute gain accrued to the top decile. AHD trends and distribution do not match, but compare favourably with, those in per capita income. The absolute gap between present‐day advanced countries and the rest of the world deepened over time, though fell in relative terms. Life expectancy has led progress in AHD, particularly until 1970, and drove the catching‐up by the rest of the world during the epidemiological transition. Political and civil liberties took over thereafter.","[('Leandro Prados de la Escosura', 'Department of Social Sciences Universidad Carlos III, and the Centre for Economic Policy Research')]","['10.1086/529000', '10.1016/S0305-750X(01)00109-7', '10.1596/1813-9450-8314', '10.1016/B978-0-444-59428-0.00012-6', '10.1080/14649880050008782', '10.1016/0022-0531(70)90039-6', '10.2307/2112627', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199662135.001.0001', '10.1162/qjec.121.1.73', '10.1257/app.2.2.1', '10.1080/00220388.2012.663907', '10.1111/1467-9361.00178', '10.1007/s10888-011-9190-3', '10.3386/w22306', '10.1111/roiw.12369', '10.1111/1468-0289.00071', '10.1257/jep.20.3.97', '10.1257/app.2.2.72', '10.7208/chicago/9780226146126.003.0002', '10.1353/dem.2005.0002', '10.2307/2234181', '10.1016/0305-750X(92)90141-H', '10.3386/w12735', '10.1515/9781400847969', '10.1016/0014-2921(91)90136-7', '10.1016/S0304-3878(02)00107-4', '10.1017/S1361491699000131', '10.1257/jep.26.3.137', '10.1111/roiw.12187', '10.1017/CBO9780511605390.003', '10.1007/s11205-015-1204-2', '10.1056/NEJM198007173030304', '10.4061/2011/261702', '10.3233/JEM-1995-21401', '10.1016/j.ehb.2010.03.001', '10.1080/19452829.2016.1200541', '10.1080/19452829.2011.645027', '10.1016/S0305-750X(97)00034-X', '10.1016/0305-750X(91)90089-Z', '10.1257/app.2.2.118', '10.1257/aer.20110236', '10.1073/pnas.1011492107', '10.1016/0304-3878(93)90061-Q', '10.2307/1973733', '10.1007/s10888-011-9178-z', '10.1177/0022343318823866', '10.1007/s11205-017-1679-0', '10.1093/wber/lhv039', '10.1017/CBO9780511510724', '10.3386/w22521', '10.1093/ajcn/72.1.241S', '10.1080/00324728.1962.10414870', '10.1080/00324728.1975.10412707', '10.2307/3349767', '10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04824-8', '10.31235/osf.io/du5g6', '10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02403.x', '10.1086/600102', '10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32130-X', '10.1080/19452829.2011.571077', '10.2307/3349375', '10.1111/roiw.12104', '10.1080/00324728.1975.10410201', '10.1016/S0305-750X(96)00141-6', '10.1596/1813-9450-3243', '10.1093/wbro/lkr009', '10.1016/j.jdeveco.2012.01.003', '10.2307/1972830', '10.1017/CBO9781316036495', '10.1016/S0921-8009(97)00168-7', '10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61690-0', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.oep.a041662', '10.1017/CBO9780511605390.004', '10.1080/00324728.1955.10405050', '10.1016/0304-4076(89)90082-1', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199944590.001.0001', '10.1007/s00355-013-0756-9', '10.1111/roiw.12235', '10.1111/roiw.12014']",Wiley

It has the traditional advantage that algorithms for branching bisimilarity are more efficient than ones for other weak behavioural equivalences, especially weak bisimilarity. With m the number of transitions and n the number of states, the classic $${O\left( {m n}\right) }$$ algorithm was recently replaced by an $$O({m (\log \left| { Act }\right| + \log n)})$$ algorithm [9], which is unfortunately rather complex. This paper combines its ideas with the ideas from Valmari [20], resulting in a simpler $$O({m \log n})$$ algorithm. Benchmarks show that in practice this algorithm is also faster and often far more memory efficient than its predecessors, making it the best option for branching bisimulation minimisation and preprocessing for calculating other weak equivalences on LTSs.","[('David N.

As a philanthropic initiative organized through a network of international cities, 100RC demonstrates how the spread of resilience thinking has been facilitated by exploiting changes in the structures and processes of global governance afforded by neoliberal globalization. The analysis focuses on explicating100RC’s animating logic of governance, which is committed to the cultivation of network connectivity. Rather than directly fostering resilience, connectivity is established as a condition under which resilience solutions can be immanently surfaced from the interactions of a diverse selection of stakeholders brought together through these networks. The article situates this governmental logic within broader changes associated with neoliberal globalization, namely the emergence of multi-scalar governance networks, the rise of philanthrocapitalism and the inception of platform capitalism. The conclusion discusses the implications of this analysis for further study of the relation between connectivity, danger, knowledge and value contained within resilience discourses.","[('Chris Zebrowski', 'Loughborough University, UK')]","['10.1177/0002764214550299', '10.1111/1467-9256.12079', '10.1068/d140133', '10.1177/1474474017726556', '10.1007/978-1-349-27295-2_12', '10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00310.x', '10.1016/j.polgeo.2005.07.002', '10.4324/9781315773810', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195328721.001.0001', '10.1007/s10021-001-0101-5', '10.1111/1467-9256.12010', '10.1177/0305829816638166', '10.2218/finsoc.v3i1.1936', '10.1111/1467-8330.00252', '10.1080/02723638.2018.1446870', '10.1080/03085140902786611', '10.1002/9780470400791', '10.1016/j.bushor.2003.11.007', '10.1177/1534484305285335', '10.1016/j.poetic.2012.02.006', '10.1080/01436597.2014.868989', '10.2307/591464', '10.4159/9780674369542', '10.1017/CBO9780511549472', '10.1080/0969229032000048853', '10.1080/0955757042000203632', '10.1080/09654310120079797', '10.1177/0002764215591187', '10.1057/978-1-349-94860-4', '10.1177/0967010611399616', '10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.07.011', '10.5751/ES-05100-180122', '10.1177/0149206307305562', '10.1080/21693293.2013.804672', '10.1080/21693293.2016.1228158']",SAGE Publications

The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is a 14-channel imaging instrument operating on NASA’s Terra satellite since 1999. ASTER’s visible–near infrared (VNIR) instrument, with three bands and a 15 m Instantaneous field of view (IFOV), is accompanied by an additional VNIR band using a second, backward-looking telescope. Collecting along-track stereo pairs, the geometry produces a base-to-height ratio of 0.6. In 2009, the ASTER Science Team released Version 1 of the global DEM (GDEM) based on stereo correlation of 1.2 million ASTER scenes. The DEM has 1 arc-second latitude and longitude postings (∼30 m) and employed cloud masking to avoid cloud-contaminated pixels. The GDEM covers all of the Earth’s land surface from 83 degrees north to 83 degrees south latitude. Version 2 was released in 2011, with notable improvements in coverage and accuracy. In 2019, the final, Version 3, was released; again improving on coverage and removing almost all artifacts. Th GDEM is a unique, global high spatial resolution digital elevation dataset available to all users at no cost. In addition, a second unique dataset was produced and released. The raster-based ASTER Global Water Body Dataset (ASTWBD) identifies the presence of permanent water bodies, and marks them as ocean, lake, or river. An accompanying DEM file indicates the elevation for each water pixel. To date, over 110+ million 1×1 degree GDEM tiles have been distributed.","[('M. Abrams', ''), ('Y. Yamaguchi', ''), ('R.

Guided by a vision of a long-term integration of the Yugoslav economy into the international division of labor on the basis of equality and mutual interest, by the late 1970s the country’s foreign trade and hard currency revenue was boosted by a number of globally oriented corporate entities, some of which survived the demise of socialism and the dissolution of the country. These enterprises had a leading role as the country’s principal exporters and as the fulcrum of a web of economic contacts and exchanges between the Global South, Western Europe, and the Soviet Bloc. The article seeks to fill a historiographic gap by focusing on two major Yugoslav enterprises (Energoinvest and Pelagonija) that were based in the less-developed federal republics—Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. The article also investigates the transnational flow of ideas around the so-called “public enterprise,” its embeddedness in an interdependent global economy, and its visions for equitable development. Finally, the article explores these enterprises as enablers of social mobility and welfare, as well as spaces where issues of efficiency, planning, self-reliance, and self-management were negotiated.","[('Ljubica Spaskovska', ''), ('Anna Calori', '')]","['10.1515/soeu-2017-0043', '10.1515/9783110534696-011', '10.2307/1191142', '10.1017/S0010417519000239', '10.1007/BF00161293', '10.1080/01436597.2014.970859', '10.1093/dh/dhv061', '10.1515/9780691219653', '10.1080/0023656X.2018.1429185', '10.1080/14631379308427759', '10.1016/0197-3975(84)90040-7']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

10.1093/shm/hkz018,SOCIAL HISTORY OF MEDICINE,0603 World History; 0712 History of Science and Technology,'Problems of Today and Tomorrow': Prevention and the National Health Service in the 1970s,[],"Summary A consensus developed around prevention in the early 1970s as a response to epidemiological studies that had highlighted smoking, diet and physical inactivity as risk factors for chronic disease, especially heart disease. This reaction was catalysed by the financial pressures the National Health Service (NHS) was experiencing, the 1974 reorganisation of the service and international awareness of the Lalonde report. Such widespread interest resulted in three different but contemporaneous reports on prevention in 1976 and 1977. All three emphasised, to varying degrees, personal responsibility and lifestyle as important tenets of prevention. This article focuses on Prevention and Health: Everybody’s Business, a 1976 discussion paper published by the four governments of the UK, to explore this preoccupation with disease prevention throughout the decade, and what it reveals about public health in Britain, political attitudes to the NHS and the changing relationship between citizenship and the welfare state.","[('Peder Clark', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

This article explores how this contradiction was exposed and challenged by some of the health service’s own workforce, who witnessed and contested racism in the National Health Service (NHS). This is discussed through the lens of the treatment of sickle cell anaemia (SCA), a genetic trait and disease more common in people of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean descent, which has been highly racialized as affecting black people in particular. By pushing for improved responses to pain in sickle cell disease, and demonstrating the need for SCA screening in urban areas, healthcare professionals within the NHS—many of whom were black or migrant nurses, health visitors or doctors—articulated the status and entitlements of Black British citizenship.","[('Grace Redhead', 'Department of History, University of Warwick, UK')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Cross-sectional high-frequency data indicate that the epidemic affected the labor supply sharply but briefly with no ensuing spill-overs; most of the recession, brief as it was, was due to the end of the war. I analyze weekly city-level mortality data and economic indicators with time series methods and structural estimation of an economic-epidemiological model: interventions to hinder the contagion reduced mortality at little economic cost, probably because reduced infections mitigated the impact on the labor force.","[('François R.

The ethnographic focus is a telecommunications company called M-Switch located in the Parisian neighborhood of le Sentier, the trajectory of which is part of a broader cultural and economic shift observable in the neighborhood from industry to new technologies. This particular company is a privileged site for witnessing how people work with and across religious differences between Maghrebi Jews and Muslims in France. The ethnography looks at how contemporary, non-nostalgic reconceptualizations of the past are utilized to negotiate an ethnically plural and potentially convivial present. Relationships within the company have a Maghrebi center made up of shared cultural memories, economic interdependency, and changing gender and class relations.

Numerous features and configuration options in the hardware and the software environment that are relevant for performance are not even known to most application users or developers. Microbenchmarks, i.e., simple codes that fathom a particular aspect of the hardware, can help to shed light on such issues, but only if they are well understood and if the results can be reconciled with known facts or performance models. The insight gained from microbenchmarks may then be applied to real applications for performance analysis or optimization. In this paper we investigate two modern Intel x86 server CPU architectures in depth: Broadwell EP and Cascade Lake SP. We highlight relevant hardware configuration settings that can have a decisive impact on code performance and show how to properly measure on-chip and off-chip data transfer bandwidths. The new victim L3 cache of Cascade Lake and its advanced replacement policy receive due attention. Finally we use DGEMM, sparse matrix-vector multiplication, and the HPCG benchmark to make a connection to relevant application scenarios.","[('Christie L.

No competitive nativist party has recently emerged in federal politics that challenges the mainstream consensus around mass immigration, unlike virtually every other postindustrial democracy. This paper argues that existing explanations for this “exceptionalism” are lacking. In particular, they fail to appreciate the importance of Quebec nationalism in contributing to this outcome. Quebec nationalism fractured the stronger anti‐immigration sentiment found in rural and smaller urban areas in both Quebec and Anglophone Canada and thereby prevented right‐wing parties from mobilising that sentiment in a way that could feasibly win elections. This forced such parties to moderate their message and court “ethnic voters” in suburban ridings around Toronto and Vancouver. We illustrate this argument using novel data which permit a comparison of the Canadian experience with nativist politics in Australia and New Zealand.","[('Joshua Gordon', 'School of Public Policy Simon Fraser University  Vancouver British Columbia Canada'), ('Sanjay Jeram', 'Department of Political Science Simon Fraser University  Burnaby British Columbia Canada'), ('Clifton van der Linden', 'Department of Political Science McMaster University  Hamilton Ontario Canada')]","['10.1080/13537113.2015.1032033', '10.1002/j.1839-4655.2003.tb01141.x', '10.1017/S0003055411000165', '10.1017/S0008423911000746', '10.1080/00313220008559135', '10.1515/9780773575387', '10.2307/2547729', '10.1017/CBO9780511510113', '10.1017/S0007123403220226', '10.1017/S1049096517000476', '10.2139/ssrn.2818659', '10.59962/9780774836098', '10.1017/CBO9781139195034', '10.1080/01402380701617563', '10.1017/CBO9781139152365.004', '10.1111/1475-6765.00015', '10.3138/9781442666313-009', '10.1017/CBO9780511492037', '10.1787/9789264010307-en', '10.1080/01402380802234631', '10.1177/019791839502900308', '10.3386/w23559', '10.1080/0140238042000228103', '10.1080/14662043.2012.692922', '10.3138/9781442674677-011', '10.1515/9780773564237', '10.59962/9780774815680', '10.1080/17457289.2016.1268144']",Wiley

Using descriptive statistics and network analysis, we reconstruct the complete network of linkages between agents involved in the origination and distribution of these bills. Our analysis reveals the truly global nature of the London bill market before the First World War and underscores the crucial role played by London intermediaries (acceptors and discounters) in overcoming information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders on this market.

10.1111/ehr.13002,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,0603 World History; 0201 Theoretical Economics,"The growth pattern of British children, 1850-1975†",[],"AbstractThis article is the first to use individual‐level, longitudinal measures of child growth to document changes in the growth pattern in Britain between the 1850s and the 1970s. Based on a unique dataset gathered from the records of the training ship Indefatigable, this study analyses the mean heights of boys at admission and their longitudinal growth using regressions that control for observable characteristics. Our findings show a secular increase in boys’ mean height over time, and that height gain was most rapid during the interwar period. In addition, longitudinal growth velocity was low and similar at different ages for boys born before the 1910s, suggesting a substantially weaker pubertal growth spurt (three standard deviations lower) than that which occurs in modern populations. However, for boys born in the 1910s and later, higher growth velocities associated with pubertal growth appeared in a narrow range of ages (14 to 16 years). Thus, it appears that there was a substantial change in the growth pattern beginning in the 1910s with the emergence of a strong pubertal growth spurt. The timing of this shift implies that declines in child morbidity mattered more for the changing growth pattern than improvements in nutrition that occurred before 1910.","[('Pei Gao', 'New York University Shanghai'), ('Eric B.

The authors suggest that WIL pedagogical practices deployed to deliver DAs can bridge traditional pedagogical and occupational divisions while building institutional resilience in a post-viral world. The paper is intended to contribute to both practitioner and policy-level discourse regarding the best practice in WIL for DAs.Design/methodology/approachA literature review of key texts was used to identify “success characteristics” in WIL “signature” pedagogies, with potential applicability for DA design and delivery. These characteristics were used to frame interrogation of best pedagogical practices, using the best practice matrix developed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with selected expert practitioners to examine their matrix responses and to discuss the researcher's initial “read-across” analysis of best practices and possible implications for pedagogical practice in WIL for DAs across other sectors. This paper also draws on feedback from employer groups who were consulted on the project report recommendations and further feedback from a national project dissemination conference in 2018. The findings from the research project have also been re-evaluated with reference to further literature in the context of the challenges presented by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).FindingsThe findings from the study indicate that pedagogical best practices were to a significant degree transferable across professions and sectors; success characteristics in one pedagogical area (for example, mentoring/practice education) underpin success in another (recognition of prior learning [RPL] and practice-based assessment of achievement); success characteristics in WIL can also be applied and operated across professions and sectors to demonstrate how the best practice in WIL should be applied in the design of DAs more generally.Research limitations/implicationsThe original project research study focussed on WIL pedagogical practices in four specified professions across four public sectors within one institution. This approach, though limited, enabled the research study to focus on in-depth qualitative interactions with practitioners from different sectors rather than institutional differences. As a consequence, the research study was able to focus on in-depth and dynamic interrelationships in pedagogical practice from the perspective of the professions, which facilitated productive examination of similarities and differences across these professions.Originality/valueThe research study provided evidence of the potential value of a more explicit recognition of WIL practice in the higher education sector and how consistent approaches to WIL should inform programme design. This has potential to improve the quality of curriculum design and pedagogy across DA programmes and provide a valuable reference point for quality assuring this provision.","[('Finbar Lillis', ''), ('Darryll Bravenboer', '')]","['10.1108/20423891211271773', '10.1108/ET-10-2015-0091', '10.4018/978-1-4666-8856-8.ch008', '10.1108/JWAM-01-2017-0002', '10.1080/0309877X.2012.699516', '10.1108/13665621111174889', '10.1108/HESWBL-05-2020-0104', '10.1080/03075070903216635', '10.1080/03075070802528296', '10.1080/02602938.2013.792106', '10.1108/HESWBL-04-2020-0074', '10.1016/j.nedt.2009.12.012', '10.1080/13636820400200265', '10.1162/0011526054622015']",Emerald
10.1093/ahr/rhab195,AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,"The Unexceptional State: Rethinking the State in the Nineteenth Century (France, United States)",[],"Abstract In the past thirty years, historians have deeply renewed our understanding of the state in the early republic period of the United States as much more powerful, deep reaching, and proactive than the traditional image represented. In France, too, new work has revised our vision of the state in the early nineteenth century, which looked different from the triumphant, Napoleonic leviathan that often appears in discourse. Yet both historiographies, having evolved separately, still base their conclusion on implicit comparisons, with an imagined “European” state or with a later “modern” state. This article uses the new historiographies on both countries to go beyond those unstated exceptionalisms to propose a reconstruction of the state in that period. Pulling those studies together, and mobilizing insights from one to shed light on the other, it recovers a common repertoire of statecraft that emerged in the revolutionary era. It hinged on fostering consent of key segments of the population and therefore organized the work of the state in mostly nonbureaucratic forms. States in that period reflected a particular enmeshing of public and private forms that needs to be analyzed for itself, especially if we want to understand the specificity of today’s practices.","[('Nicolas Barreyre', ''), ('Claire Lemercier', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

It was resolved through negotiations between Athens and Skopje, mediated by the United Nations, resulting in the Prespa (or Prespes) Agreement, which was signed on June 17, 2018, and ratified by both parliaments amid controversy in their countries. The underlying issues involved deeply held and differing views relating to national identity, history, and the future of the region, which were resolved through a change in the name of the new state and various agreements as to identity issues.

Data show that this unit contains remnants of a Mesoproterozoic granite (Dobra Gneiss Type A), early Neoproterozoic sediments (paragneiss, marble) and late Neoproterozoic volcanic-arc granitoids from the Avalonian–Cadomian peri-Gondwana Orogen (Dobra Gneiss Type B, Spitz Gneiss). A rock association of such old age is extraordinary in the Variscan Orogen. We interpret that these rocks were originally part of the Brunovistulian foreland plate (i.e. part of Avalonian Europe and the Devonian Old Red Continent, respectively) before being tectonically incorporated into the eastern flank of the Variscan Orogen. This interpretation is considered likely because the Dobra Gneiss Type B turned out to be extremely similar, geochemically and in age, to the Bittesch Gneiss in the Moravian Zone, which is generally accepted as a Brunovistulian (i.e. Avalonian) rock. Based on the zircon ages measured in ortho- and paragneiss samples, the Drosendorf Unit can be excellently correlated with West Amazonia. This supports the long-standing idea that Avalonian Europe contains terranes of Amazonian ancestry. A model is presented to show how West Amazonian rocks could have been transferred to Europe in the Early Paleozoic.","[('Martin Lindner', 'Department of Chemistry and Physics of Materials, University of Salzburg, Jakob-Haringer-Straße 2a, 5020 Salzburg, Austria'), ('Wolfgang Dörr', 'Institut für Geowissenschaften, Goethe-Universität, Altenhöferallee 1, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany'), ('Daniel Reither', 'Department of Chemistry and Physics of Materials, University of Salzburg, Jakob-Haringer-Straße 2a, 5020 Salzburg, Austria'), ('Fritz Finger', 'Department of Chemistry and Physics of Materials, University of Salzburg, Jakob-Haringer-Straße 2a, 5020 Salzburg, Austria')]","['10.1016/j.precamres.2010.08.010', '10.2478/v10096-011-0023-x', '10.1144/GSL.SP.2002.201.01.02', '10.1016/B978-0-444-42148-7.50008-3', '10.1144/GSL.MEM.2006.032.01.05', '10.1046/j.1525-1314.2000.00273.x', '10.1130/2007.1200(14)', '10.1016/0040-1951(92)90132-P', '10.1016/j.precamres.2014.12.015', '10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00963-9', '10.1007/978-3-642-77518-5_42', '10.1016/0301-9268(89)90042-9', '10.1144/GSL.SP.2000.179.01.08', '10.1144/GSL.SP.2000.179.01.05', '10.1016/j.chemgeo.2008.07.025', '10.1130/0091-7613(2000)28<1035:DTAOTS>2.0.CO;2', '10.1007/s00531-004-0420-9', '10.1007/BF00212416', '10.1093/petrology/42.11.2033', '10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2019.103669', '10.1016/j.tecto.2015.11.020', '10.2343/geochemj.29.91', '10.1016/j.chemgeo.2004.06.017', '10.1093/petrology/egl013', '10.1016/j.precamres.2009.09.011', '10.1007/s00531-007-0183-1', '10.12789/geocanj.2014.41.039', '10.1016/j.tecto.2008.01.012', '10.1080/00206814.2010.543783', '10.1144/jgs2013-059', '10.1016/j.gr.2013.03.001', '10.1016/j.precamres.2007.04.021', '10.1007/BF00402106', '10.3190/jgeosci.271', '10.1144/CEV1P.3', '10.1016/j.tecto.2008.05.002', '10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.02.007', '10.5327/Z1519-874X2009000200005', '10.1130/0091-7613(1989)017<0735:MFTEOT>2.3.CO;2', '10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00070-3', '10.1144/0016-764903-064', '10.4138/1608', '10.1130/GSATG24A.1', '10.1130/0091-7613(1994)022<0617:CBISAT>2.3.CO;2', '10.1016/0301-9268(91)90005-U', '10.1016/S0040-1951(02)00187-7', '10.1144/SP297.17', '10.1144/SP327.12', '10.1016/j.gr.2009.08.001', '10.1016/j.gsf.2011.11.008', '10.1016/j.gr.2012.12.026', '10.1144/0016-764903-083', '10.1144/0016-76492006-023', '10.1007/BF00212415', '10.1007/s005310050019', '10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030<0039:ROTCMI>2.0.CO;2', '10.1093/petrology/25.4.956', '10.1007/BF00384745', '10.1016/S0040-1951(99)00235-8', '10.1007/BF00381441', '10.1007/s00710-016-0427-5', '10.1007/978-981-10-0666-1', '10.1007/BF01828768', '10.1093/petrology/egt015', '10.1007/s00531-016-1416-y', '10.1016/0012-821X(75)90088-6', '10.1017/S0016756818000031', '10.1144/0016-76492006-014', '10.1007/BF01820841', '10.1080/11035892609455322', '10.1144/GSL.SP.1989.042.01.19', '10.1007/s005310050165', '10.18814/epiiugs/1999/v22i3/004', '10.1007/s00531-009-0498-1', '10.1016/S0012-821X(00)00312-5', '10.1016/j.gsf.2018.04.001', '10.1016/S0040-1951(03)00015-5', '10.1016/j.gr.2017.02.002', '10.1111/j.1751-908X.1995.tb00147.x', '10.1144/jgs2012-152', '10.1016/S0040-1951(02)00344-X', '10.1144/GSL.MEM.2006.032.01.19', '10.1016/0040-1951(86)90236-2', '10.1016/j.lithos.2013.11.010', '10.1016/j.gr.2014.06.011']",Geological Society of London

Scholars taking this approach have explored distinctive genres of steles to transform our understanding of north China under Mongol rule. Through a case study, I show how a set of steles installed in the fifteenth-century rural world of north China transmitted authority and power not just through the content of their inscriptions but also through other written and unwritten information they stored. I give particular attention to the ways in which the inscriptions were materialized and visualized. In doing so, I argue that emphasizing the public communication function of steles challenges us to think beyond primary sources strictly in terms of their textual value to reflect more broadly on modes of transmission and the power dynamics contained within them.","[('Jinping Wang', '')]","['10.1353/sys.0.0018', '10.1017/S1479591416000024', '10.1353/sys.2014.0009', '10.1163/ej.9789004192287.i-430', '10.1017/jch.2019.11', '10.7551/mitpress/1208.001.0001', '10.1080/15299104.2016.1226571', '10.1163/15685322-10456P05', '10.1163/24684791-01901004', '10.1515/9780824861872', '10.1515/9781400860432']",Cambridge University Press (CUP)

Its influence on society and economy during this period was profound, but this article is the first attempt to determine the scale of its impact by examining the amount of money annually spent on relief across the whole period. Drawing on data from 184 widely dispersed parishes over more than two centuries and a new estimate for spending in c.1600, it shows that poor relief experienced alternating phases of rapid expansion, relative stability and occasionally outright retrenchment. Levels of redistribution were pushed higher by both ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ factors. Specifically, trends in relief spending are compared to other indices such as population, economic expansion, central government revenues, labourers’ wages and inflation to show how the growth of poor relief related to wider demographic and economic changes. Such comparisons make it possible to think more clearly about causation: how much of the growth in spending can be attributed to such developments? While law, demography, inflation and other well-attested factors certainly contributed to the rise of this early modern welfare system, the poor themselves may well have played an important role.","[('Brodie Waddell', 'Birkbeck, University of London')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

This article explores the sensory history of the revolution through ego-documents like diaries and memoirs. It tracks in detail how people of various backgrounds in Petrograd and Moscow lived the olfactory class struggles after February and the taste excesses of the post-October “wine pogroms,” how they expressed a new experience of time in a sensory idiom, and how they ultimately became habituated to the new sounds and sights of revolutionary Russia. Historiography is at a propitious moment to move beyond a dichotomy of discourse versus “raw” experience: conjoining the histories of experience, the senses, and the emotions, the article probes what is to be gained from interpreting a world-historical event with a concept of experience as an integrated, multimodal, simultaneous sensory-emotional-cognitive process. Avant-garde artists, contemporaries of the Russian Revolution, foreshadowed such a holistic concept of experience by a century.","[('Jan Plamper', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Despite recent progress in developing verification methods for specifications such as local adversarial robustness in deep neural networks (DNNs) in terms of scalability, precision, and applicability to different network architectures, layers, and activation functions, robustness verification of semantic segmentation has not yet been considered. We address this limitation by developing and applying new robustness analysis methods for several segmentation neural network architectures, specifically by addressing reachability analysis of up-sampling layers, such as transposed convolution and dilated convolution. We consider several definitions of robustness for segmentation, such as the percentage of pixels in the output that can be proven robust under different adversarial perturbations, and a robust variant of intersection-over-union (IoU), the typical performance evaluation measure for segmentation tasks. Our approach is based on a new relaxed reachability method, allowing users to select the percentage of a number of linear programming problems (LPs) to solve when constructing the reachable set, through a relaxation factor percentage. The approach is implemented within NNV, then applied and evaluated on segmentation datasets, such as a multi-digit variant of MNIST known as M2NIST. Thorough experiments show that by using transposed convolution for up-sampling and average-pooling for down-sampling, combined with minimizing the number of ReLU layers in the SSNs, we can obtain SSNs with not only high accuracy (IoU), but also that are more robust to adversarial attacks and amenable to verification. Additionally, using our new relaxed reachability method, we can significantly reduce the verification time for neural networks whose ReLU layers dominate the total analysis time, even in classification tasks.","[('Hoang-Dung Tran', ''), ('Neelanjana Pal', ''), ('Patrick Musau', ''), ('Diego Manzanas Lopez', ''), ('Nathaniel Hamilton', ''), ('Xiaodong Yang', ''), ('Stanley Bak', ''), ('Taylor T.

10.1093/ahr/rhab001,AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW,0603 World History,Rabbis of the (Scientific) Revolution: Revealing the Hidden Corpus of Early Modern Translations Produced by Jewish Religious Thinkers,[],"Abstract This essay discusses the corpus of translations of non-Jewish texts into Jewish languages, which emerged during the early modern period. Particular attention is given to Hebrew translations produced by members of the Jewish religious elite during the long eighteenth century, which have hitherto been viewed as original Jewish works. The article argues that translation was perfectly suited to the combination of attraction and anxiety with which many early modern Jews, particularly members of the Jewish religious elite, observed the cultural developments of their time. These authors acknowledged (what they viewed as) their own cultural inferiority, but feared the potential hazards of direct exposure to non-Jewish texts and ideas. Jewish translators thus became cultural gatekeepers rather than passive recipients of non-Jewish culture. They mistranslated both deliberately and accidentally, added and omitted, gave new meanings to texts and ideas, and harnessed their sources to meet their own agendas. The works of these translators reveal a form of cultural transfer that relied on the mindful adaptation and reformulation of new ideas by discreet, almost inadvertent innovators.","[('Iris Idelson-Shein', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Using the example of Mexico, it then demonstrates some of the weaknesses of the current literature's assumptions and argues for the potential usefulness of a new way of seeing the period and its interconnected conflicts.","[('WILLIAM A.
