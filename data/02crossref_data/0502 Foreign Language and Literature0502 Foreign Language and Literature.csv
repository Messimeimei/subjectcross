10.6018/analesff.572441,ANALES DE FILOLOGIA FRANCESA,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,The political ethos on Twitter: four French and Spanish cases,[],"The discourse on Twitter has shown that the transmission of information, opinions, and values is not proportional to the length of that discourse. The microblogging platform integrates other techno-discursive éléments (Paveau, 2013) that expand the message and go beyond a purely logocentric approach. In political discourse, both men and women have become prominent users of this social media platform. This paper provides an analysis of the discourse of four top-ranking figures in French and Spanish politics : the two current presidents (Emmanuel Macron and Pedro Sánchez) and the two opposition leaders (Marine Le Pen and Alberto Núñez Feijóo). Drawing from a corpus of tweets published by these public figures on their official personal accounts over the same perior, our methodological approach aims to decipher how these political figures outline their public image (ethos), the similarities and differences between them.

Civil War–era African Americans recognized the urgency of a core political concern: how best to use the opportunity presented by this conflict over slavery to win abolition and secure enduring black rights, goals that had eluded earlier generations of black veterans. Some, like Frederick Douglass, urged immediate enlistment to support the cause of emancipation, hoping that a Northern victory would bring about the end of slavery. But others counseled patience and negotiation, drawing on a historical memory of unfulfilled promises for black military service in previous American wars and encouraging black men to leverage their position to demand abolition and equal citizenship. In doing this, they also began redefining what it meant to be a black man who fights for the United States. These debates over African Americans’ enlistment expose a formative moment in the development of American citizenship: black Northerners’ key demand was that military service earn full American citizenship, a term that had no precise definition prior to the Fourteenth Amendment. In articulating this demand, Taylor argues, black Northerners participated in the remaking of American citizenship itself—unquestionably one of the war’s most important results.","[('Brian Taylor', '')]",[],University of North Carolina Press

It proved a source of constant frustration for Abraham Lincoln, and its commander, George B. McClellan, even secured the Democratic nomination for president in 1864. This book uses untapped sources to recast our understanding of soldier ideology and presents the most comprehensive view yet of the army’s political story. It recounts the struggle between Republicans and Democrats for political allegiance among the army’s rank and file, in the process showing that the army’s captains, majors, and colonels spurred a pro-Republican political awakening among the enlisted men that burst onto the public stage through newspaper editorials, unit resolutions, and letters to home front politicians. The book traces the heated campaigning and voting activity on the front lines during critical elections such as the 1864 presidential contest, highlighting how an army that had once revered McClellan renounced him for consorting with the forces of peace activism and treason. Union soldiers asserted themselves as the guardians of civic virtue and used the power of political organization to set the terms in a heated debate over wartime loyalty.","[('Zachery A.

10.1093/alh/ajab005,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Literary Agency,[],"AbstractThis essay is one part documentation and one part provocation, with a simple goal: to acknowledge the agency of the literary agent. There is no figure more significant to contemporary literary production and less studied by scholars than the agent. Drawing on ethnographic interviews conducted with 28 literary agents over the course of four years, I argue that agents shape the form and content of contemporary fiction by acting as administrators of the logic of the marketplace, conditioning their clients to write in and for the international multimedia conglomerates known as the Big Four. I take the agent’s list to be one of the central organizing heuristics of the contemporary literary field and read the list of one agent, Nicole Aragi, to examine what I call “corporate taste”: personal aesthetic judgments carefully calibrated to anticipate and respond to the demands of publishing conglomerates.Agents calibrate their aesthetic judgments to anticipate and respond to the demands of publishers and the market, becoming administrators of the logic of the corporation, thus shaping the form and content of contemporary fiction.","[('Laura B McGrath', 'assistant professor of English at Temple University, specializing in contemporary American literature and cultural analytics')]","['10.7588/worllitetoda.88.5.0095', '10.1515/9781503615861', '10.4159/9780674036536', '10.2307/j.ctvjsf59f', '10.3368/cl.58.4.462']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

As a philanthropic initiative organized through a network of international cities, 100RC demonstrates how the spread of resilience thinking has been facilitated by exploiting changes in the structures and processes of global governance afforded by neoliberal globalization. The analysis focuses on explicating100RC’s animating logic of governance, which is committed to the cultivation of network connectivity. Rather than directly fostering resilience, connectivity is established as a condition under which resilience solutions can be immanently surfaced from the interactions of a diverse selection of stakeholders brought together through these networks. The article situates this governmental logic within broader changes associated with neoliberal globalization, namely the emergence of multi-scalar governance networks, the rise of philanthrocapitalism and the inception of platform capitalism. The conclusion discusses the implications of this analysis for further study of the relation between connectivity, danger, knowledge and value contained within resilience discourses.","[('Chris Zebrowski', 'Loughborough University, UK')]","['10.1177/0002764214550299', '10.1111/1467-9256.12079', '10.1068/d140133', '10.1177/1474474017726556', '10.1007/978-1-349-27295-2_12', '10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00310.x', '10.1016/j.polgeo.2005.07.002', '10.4324/9781315773810', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195328721.001.0001', '10.1007/s10021-001-0101-5', '10.1111/1467-9256.12010', '10.1177/0305829816638166', '10.2218/finsoc.v3i1.1936', '10.1111/1467-8330.00252', '10.1080/02723638.2018.1446870', '10.1080/03085140902786611', '10.1002/9780470400791', '10.1016/j.bushor.2003.11.007', '10.1177/1534484305285335', '10.1016/j.poetic.2012.02.006', '10.1080/01436597.2014.868989', '10.2307/591464', '10.4159/9780674369542', '10.1017/CBO9780511549472', '10.1080/0969229032000048853', '10.1080/0955757042000203632', '10.1080/09654310120079797', '10.1177/0002764215591187', '10.1057/978-1-349-94860-4', '10.1177/0967010611399616', '10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.07.011', '10.5751/ES-05100-180122', '10.1177/0149206307305562', '10.1080/21693293.2013.804672', '10.1080/21693293.2016.1228158']",SAGE Publications
10.1093/alh/ajaa019,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,The Racialization of Print,[],"AbstractThis essay reimagines the centuries-long process through which printed objects in the Anglophone world became powerfully associated with white supremacy and ideologies of racial hierarchy. It argues that the racialization of print was not inevitable but contingent, uneven, and always contested; that it continually shifted, varying widely from place to place; and that it occurred in relation to the medium’s changing associations with such other unstable social and ideological categories as class, gender, religion, and nation. The essay proposes two phases for this historical process: the establishment phase, during which the hyperelite medium of the printed codex acquired an association with white authorship in the early modern period; and the essentializing phase, during which, over the course of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, a printed book by a single author came to be understood as capable of representing the essential nature of an entire race of people. Samson Occom and Phillis Wheatley wrote during the shift between these two phases of print’s racialization. A comparative case study of Occom’s and Wheatley’s relationships to book publication suggests that early modern social and class hierarchies were more important to their navigation of the medium’s racialized dynamics than is commonly granted.","[('Joseph Rezek', '')]","['10.1017/CBO9781139164030', '10.2307/3491622', '10.1353/book35489', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199313501.001.0001', '10.1086/669608', '10.4159/harvard.9780674073913', '10.1515/9781503621183-011', '10.1515/9781503616516', '10.1086/240164', '10.2307/j.ctvgs08p1', '10.1093/alh/aji042', '10.1525/9780520917149', '10.1086/448318', '10.1353/eal.2015.0020', '10.7551/mitpress/1208.001.0001', '10.1215/-12-2-1', '10.2307/3125136', '10.18574/nyu/9780814743386.001.0001', '10.1525/9780520953789', '10.1215/9780822384144', '10.9783/9780812206371', '10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199287048.001.0001', '10.9783/9780812206296.19', '10.5149/9780807899472_round', '10.2307/3125139', '10.9783/9780812200140', '10.1353/ncr.2004.0015']",Oxford University Press (OUP)
10.1093/alh/ajz056,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Museumizing Slavery: Living History in Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad,[],"AbstractThis essay examines Colson Whitehead’s novel in relation to the museumizing of slavery that has gained momentum since the 1990s, focusing in particular on the Living History exhibition practice in which the Underground Railroad has played a vital part. Taking as my point of departure Whitehead’s signature move of building narrative worlds based on the logic of literalizing metaphor, I argue that his literal rendering of the Underground Railroad casts the novel as a grotesque tour of the US racial history. Structured as a train ride that transports readers to different historical sites, the novel at once stages and travesties the Living History practice of materializing the past in all its concrete particularity. I argue that Whitehead’s literalizing move also deviates from earlier literary efforts to stage a visceral, affective confrontation with the history of slavery. Responding to the heightened visibility rather than the absence of slavery from public memory, the novel casts into bold relief the historical frameworks (of American freedom stories and up-from-slavery narratives of racial advancement), pedagogical aims (of racial reconciliation and pluralist inclusion), and aesthetic strategies (of affective identification and cathartic confrontation) at play in current commemorations and exhibitions of slavery.","[('Madhu Dubey', '')]","['10.1215/9780822387022', '10.1111/j.1468-2303.2009.00501.x', '10.2979/globalsouth.11.1.05', '10.1525/tph.2014.36.1.36', '10.2307/466593', '10.2307/j.ctt1bj4s8q', '10.1525/tph.2013.35.3.8', '10.2307/j.ctv11cw1hd.25']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Our findings offer a radically different understanding of the documentary evidence and establish that Chaucer and Chaumpaigne were not opponents but belonged to the same party in a legal dispute with Chaumpaigne’s former employer, Thomas Staundon, who had sued them both under the Statute of Laborers. Chaumpaigne’s quitclaims for Chaucer offered the most expedient legal path under the Statute of Laborers for both Chaucer and Chaumpaigne to demonstrate that she had left her employment with Staundon voluntarily, as opposed to being coerced or abducted (raptus), before commencing work for Chaucer.","[('Euan Roger', 'The National Archives Kew, England (Euan.Roger@nationalarchives.gov.uk)'), ('Sebastian Sobecki', 'University of Toronto Toronto, Ontario (sebastian.sobecki@utoronto.ca)')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

Drawing on social identity theory and the scholarship on populist rhetoric and anti-LGBTQ politics, the article examines 46 interviews, press statements, public speeches, and op-eds by Orbán. Using critical discourse analysis (CDA) and Wodak’s discourse-historical approach, it shows how the prime minister frames LGBTQ communities as an out-group that poses a threat to Hungarian values and way of living. Similar to the issue of immigration and existing anti-LGBTQ frames in other countries, Orbán presents LGBTQ groups within his well-established anti-Western narrative. In addition, he connects LGBTQ communities to other out-groups that have been portrayed as a threat for a long time. The study sheds new light on the linguistic strategies of Orbán and shows how populist rhetoric and social categorization complement each other in a political campaign.","[('Marton Gera', 'University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands')]","['10.1080/10758216.2019.1643249', '10.1057/9780230592100', '10.1080/14754835.2014.919213', '10.1017/CBO9781316336045', '10.1080/13510347.2015.1076214', '10.1007/978-3-030-16319-8', '10.1177/0038038518762081', '10.1080/13510347.2018.1485015', '10.1111/1475-6765.12334', '10.1080/14754835.2014.919217', '10.1177/1369148117715646', '10.1086/702229', '10.1515/9789633861103-010', '10.1080/13510347.2018.1455664', '10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328522', '10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700', '10.1086/701832', '10.1080/13510347.2017.1328676', '10.1080/23745118.2020.1717064', '10.19195/1899-5101.11.2(21).5', '10.1177/13634607211008067', '10.1017/S1537592718002165', '10.1177/1742715018793741', '10.1093/ccc/tcz009', '10.1177/0093650216644026', '10.1177/0957926516687406', '10.1080/23745118.2019.1569338', '10.1111/0162-895X.00230', '10.1177/1369148118775043', '10.4135/9781849208871', '10.1177/0888325418796929', '10.1016/j.postcomstud.2018.07.005', '10.1353/jod.2018.0043', '10.26529/cepsj.168', '10.1177/1750481320963273', '10.1017/S1755048321000134', '10.1080/08865655.2017.1402200', '10.1111/j.1469-8129.2010.00476.x', '10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x', '10.1017/gov.2012.11', '10.1080/14754835.2019.1647100', '10.1057/cep.2008.31', '10.1017/gov.2013.21', '10.1007/s12119-014-9254-1', '10.1080/13569775.2020.1781332', '10.21832/RUSSEL3453', '10.1111/bjso.12419', '10.1177/0268580920930591', '10.1177/0093650218794854', '10.1177/0267323116680132', '10.1080/15362426.2015.1010872', '10.1111/j.2044-8260.1979.tb00324.x', '10.4324/9780203505984-16', '10.1177/2336825X1802600110', '10.1080/14782804.2020.1757415', '10.19195/1899-5101.12.2(23).4', '10.1177/0957926593004002006', '10.1057/s41295-021-00256-3', '10.5406/illinois/9780252037726.001.0001', '10.1080/14754835.2014.919218', '10.1075/dd.4.2.04wod', '10.1002/9781118611463.wbielsi116', '10.4135/9781446270073', '10.1177/0957926519889109', '10.4000/mots.23007', '10.1177/0957926520977217', '10.5040/9781472544940']",SAGE Publications

10.1093/alh/ajaa033,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Reprinting the Past/Re-Ordering Black Social Life,[],"Abstract This essay recovers the cultural and political history of Arno Press’s landmark republication project, The American Negro: His History and Literature. Within the context of the “reprint revolution,” the period when large publishing houses clamored to publish African American texts, many of which had long been out of print, and with the backing of The New York Times, Arno Press reissued hundreds of titles by and about Black life. While these titles have come to shape the contours of African American literary scholarship, the project was immediately ensnared within debates about the future of Black political life. Knitting together personal correspondence, advertisements, and reviews, this essay situates the Arno Press endeavor with a longer history of Black print culture in which the past was harnessed in the name of imagining new political futures. Yet, within the context of the late 1960s “reprint revolution,” I show how the Black past was summoned in the service of a liberal fantasy of assimilation, social management, and racial reform.

Here I build on that thinking, on Michelle Wright's concept of Epiphenomenal time, and on Priscilla Layne's exploration of Afrofuturist temporal aesthetics in Wenzel's dramatic work, to discuss how Wenzel and Otoo as contemporary European novelists explore literary storytelling that is temporally insurrectionary. Neither of the novels considered here is typically Afrofuturist: both, however, have resonances with the Afropean Contemporary as described by Philipp Khabo Koepsell. Each novel engages poetic strategies to historicise and denaturalise the present, to render different pasts thinkable, and to address the shape that a future order might take. Both use an aesthetic strategy I call transtemporality, where meaning is deepened and rendered complex across time‐space. The transtemporal perspective is insurrectionary not least because it renders power's emergence and fall visible. Both Wenzel and Otoo develop narratives whose progression is not linear but moves in coils or loops (‘Serpentinen’, ‘Schleifen’) across what María Lugones calls ‘multiple, intersecting, co‐temporaneous realities’. That, I argue, is an aesthetic strategy that represents vital movement in the face of the almost literally petrifying force that is necropolitical or racialised time.Anthony Reeds Konzepte ʻracial timeʼ und ʻfreedom timeʼ erläutern eine Ästhetik der Möglichkeit im literarischen Schreiben Schwarzer avantgardistischer Autor*innen in den USA. Aufbauend darauf und in Anlehnung an Michelle Wrights Konzept der Epiphänomenalen Zeit und Priscilla Laynes Erforschung einer afrofuturistischen Ästhetik in Wenzels dramatischem Werk, geht dieser Beitrag der Frage nach, wie Wenzel und Otoo als zeitgenössische europäische Autorinnen literarische Erzählweisen erproben, die sich gegen konventionelle ästhetische Strukturen der Zeitlichkeit auflehnen. Die hier untersuchten Romane sind nicht typisch afrofuturistisch, haben jedoch Resonanzen mit der Afropean Contemporary, wie sie von Philipp Khabo Koepsell konzipiert worden ist. Poetische Strategien lassen die Gegenwart als bedingt und veränderbar erscheinen, unterschiedliche Vergangenheiten und eine andere zukünftige Ordnung werden denkbar. Beide Dichterinnen verwenden eine ästhetische Strategie, die ich Transtemporalität nenne, wobei die erzählerische Bewegung durch Zeit und Raum Bedeutungsmomente verdichtet. Diese transtemporale Perspektive bezeichne ich als aufständisch nicht zuletzt deshalb, weil sie die Vergänglichkeit der Macht offenlegt. Wenzel und Otoo erzählen nicht linear, sondern in Serpentinen bzw. Schleifen. Sie schaffen damit ʻmultiple, sich überschneidende, zeitgleiche Realitätenʼ (María Lugones). Das ist eine ästhetische Strategie, die angesichts der fast buchstäblich versteinernden Kraft einer nekropolitischen oder rassifizierten Zeit vitale Bewegung denkbar werden lässt.","[('Sarah Colvin', 'University of Cambridge')]",[],Wiley

Para ello, se revisan las principales aportaciones previas al estudio del fenómeno: desde las más extendidas, de carácter gramatical y semántico, a las más recientes de naturaleza pragmática. Se propone, por un lado, una explicación cognitiva y metarrepresentacional que define la intensificación como el intento lingüístico de un hablante por modificar los supuestos que le atribuye al oyente y que no responden a sus expectativas. Por otro lado, se considera que esta modificación de los supuestos del oyente persigue unos efectos retóricos determinados, normalmente relacionados con la consecución de metas locales o globales de los hablantes en una determinada interacción en curso. This article proposes a characterisation of intensification from a pragmatic perspective, aiming to establish a comprehensive, delimited and unitary definition This characterisation aspires to contribute to the recognition of the uses of intensification in real contexts and to help distinguish intensification from other similar phenomena. Before presenting the definition, the main contributions on the study of intensification are reviewed, both those conceived from a grammatical-semantic perspective and from a pragmatic perspective (the second are the most recent).A cognitive and meta-representational perspective presents intensification as a linguistic attempt of a speaker to modify the assumptions that he/she attributes to the listener, and that do not meet this speaker’s expectations. From a rhetorical perspective, the modification of the listener's assumptions pursues certain rhetorical effects, usually related to the achievement of local or global goals of the speaker in an ongoing interaction.","[('Marta Albelda Marco', ''), ('María Estellés Arguedas', '')]",[],Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia

It develops historical cripistemology as a method through which to examine the historical experiences and epistemologies, rather than representations, of disability in particular times and places and emphasizes the vast and varied entanglements of those experiences and epistemologies with mainstream US culture. To do so, “Touching The Scarlet Letter” turns to perhaps the most canonical American novel to show how returning disability history to a text—here Nathaniel Hawthorne’s connections to and interest in blind education as well as the extensive cultural influence of the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind in the 1840s and 1850s—can reframe fundamental aspects of our analyses, such as how we understand reading and interpretation. In so doing, this essay argues for and begins to uncover a hidden disability history of US literature and culture.","[('Sari Altschuler', '')]","['10.18574/nyu/9781479845637.003.0004', '10.1353/eal.2017.0000', '10.7208/chicago/9780226039688.001.0001', '10.1056/NEJM183803210180701', '10.7756/dsa.040.003.37-60', '10.1353/ecs.2006.0004', '10.9783/9780812292848', '10.7208/chicago/9780226484198.001.0001', '10.4159/9780674037229', '10.1353/saf.2001.0005', '10.1353/saf.2001.0008', '10.5422/fordham/9780823230990.003.0005', '10.18574/nyu/9781479872411.001.0001', '10.3828/jlcds.2014.12', '10.1353/eal.2017.0002', '10.18574/nyu/9781479845637.003.0060', '10.1017/S002187580002380X', '10.1515/9781400862252', '10.2307/365609', '10.3828/jlcds.2014.16', '10.1353/saf.2001.0007', '10.7208/chicago/9780226709659.001.0001', '10.1215/10642684-9-1-2-25', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199743476.001.0001', '10.9783/9780812206180', '10.1353/sew.2017.0065', '10.16995/ntn.715', '10.1002/9781118405376.wbevl032', '10.1086/694538', '10.1353/saf.2001.0004']",Duke University Press

10.1215/00029831-8878542,AMERICAN LITERATURE,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Unsentimental Historicizing: The Neo-Slave Narrative Tradition and the Refusal of Feeling,[],"AbstractRooted partially in the US sentimental tradition, neo-slave narratives often feature lyrical language, emphasize the emotional experience of enslaved characters, and evoke the reader’s sympathy and empathy. Highlighting the use of sentimental conventions in neo-slave narratives including Alex Haley’s Roots (1976), Octavia E. Butler’s Kindred (1979), Sherley Anne Williams’s Dessa Rose (1986), Toni Morrison’s Beloved (1987), Lawrence Hill’s The Book of Negroes (2007), and M. NourbeSe Philip’s Zong! (2008), this essay explores the tension between sentimentality and the radical political goals of neo-slave narratives. This essay analyzes Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad (2016) as a neo-slave narrative that rejects rather than revises sentimental conventions. The novel’s central conceit, a literal subterranean rail network, illustrates how anti-Blackness, settler colonialism, and racial capitalism interlock to materially and discursively enable the US nation-state and liberal citizenship; sentimental conventions facilitate processes of containment and capture that allow this infrastructure to function smoothly rather than disrupting it. In contrast, Underground foregrounds the prosaic over the lyrical, veils the interiority of its characters, and unsettles the reader’s desire to feel with or for the humanity of the enslaved. The novel models an alternative way of engaging slavery as an infrastructure, gesturing toward a mode of fugitive affiliation premised on acts of tangible care rather than affective identification or the possession of interiority.","[('Gabriella Friedman', '')]","['10.2307/2902712', '10.1215/9780822389163', '10.1215/00267929-1631478', '10.1215/9781478002581', '10.14321/crnewcentrevi.18.1.0105', '10.1515/9781400822690', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816676408.001.0001', '10.4159/9780674425781', '10.1215/00029831-76-3-495', '10.1093/alh/ajz056', '10.1353/cal.2012.0043', '10.3917/rfea.157.0146', '10.1353/mfs.2018.0022', '10.1515/9780823282166', '10.7591/9781501727375', '10.1093/melus/mlz010', '10.2307/3041793', '10.1353/yale.1997.0024', '10.1353/afa.2013.0079', '10.1093/alh/7.1.92', '10.1093/oso/9780195125337.001.0001', '10.25071/1913-5874/37359', '10.4324/9780203904404', '10.1017/CBO9780511485671', '10.1215/9780822371847', '10.1353/nar.2004.0016']",Duke University Press

10.15393/j10.art.2021.5321,NEIZVESTNYI DOSTOEVSKII-THE UNKNOWN DOSTOEVSKY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,The Relevance of Dostoevsky,[],"The year 2021 marks the 200th anniversary of Dostoevsky’s birth and the 140th anniversary of his immortality. Literary anniversaries became a part of the Russian culture relatively recently. The celebration is usually held in memory of those who had already found eternity. The attempt to celebrate the tercentenary of Shakespeare (1864) and the centenary of Pushkin’s birth in 1899 marked the beginning of a new cultural tradition. The dates of literary anniversaries in the 20th century reflect the struggle between these trends: birthdays are gradually replacing memorial days. Anniversaries tend to be an occasion not only for understanding a writer’s significance in the modern world, but also for analyzing the trends and prospects of studying their legacy. The article provides an overview of the past anniversaries of Dostoevsky in Russia and an analysis of several articles from the first issue of The Unknown Dostoevsky journal for 2021. The special feature of Dostoevsky’s bicentennial anniversary is the competition held by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) “Sources and methods in the study of the legacy of F. M. Dostoevsky in Russian and world culture” (2018–2021), which resulted in the support of 28 projects by leading Russian scientists. They will result in the publication of an unprecedented corpus of studies on Dostoevsky’s biography, philosophy, creativity, textual criticism and poetics. In post-Soviet Russia, the gap between Dostoevsky studies and mass consciousness, science and education is apparent. Moreover, technologies to counteract Dostoevsky’s influence on the modern Russian person are still operating. Reading and studying Dostoevsky remains the privilege of philologists, whose number in Russian universities has been drastically reduced with no prospects of the development of continuous humanitarian education. Nevertheless, despite influential opponents, Dostoevsky represents Russia, the Karamazovs are the most famous Russian surname, and today, just like 150 years ago, the prophet and apostle Dostoevsky conveys the word of truth and veracity to the world.","[('Vladimir Zakharov', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University

Not only an object to be traded and used, the slave was also a kind of currency, a form of value that anchored the market itself. And this value was not destroyed in the war. Slavery still structured social relations and cultural production in the United States more than a century after it was formally abolished. As Aaron Carico reveals in Black Market, slavery’s engine of capital accumulation was preserved and transformed, and the slave commodity survived emancipation. Through both archival research and lucid readings of literature, art, and law, from the plight of the Fourteenth Amendment to the myth of the cowboy, Carico breaks open the icons of liberalism to expose the shaping influence of slavery's political economy in America after 1865. Ultimately, Black Market shows how a radically incomplete and fundamentally failed abolition enabled the emergence of a modern nation-state, in which slavery still determined--and now goes on to determine--economic, political, and cultural life.","[('Aaron Carico', '')]",[],University of North Carolina Press

Here I read her Bachmann‐prizewinning story Herr Gröttrup setzt sich hin through the lens of Jamika Ajalon's conception of a fugitive archetype of resistance, which is, I argue, simultaneously a working definition of a literary work of art. I also read the story as a literary investigation of the phenomenon Miranda Fricker has called epistemic injustice (‘a wrong done to someone specifically in their capacity as a knower’). Fricker's articulation of epistemic injustice has helped spark an ‘epistemic turn’ across disciplines. I refer particularly to José Medina's development of her work in his Epistemology of Resistance (2013). Subaltern subjects, argues Medina, can gain an epistemic advantage because they have to work harder cognitively, maintaining ‘two cognitive perspectives simultaneously’. Theorists of epistemic injustice strikingly often rely for their arguments on literary fiction, which has long been alerting its readers to epistemic injustice and its painful or lethal consequences. Otoo, I argue, uses storytelling and humour to offer both the epistemically privileged Gröttrups and her epistemically privileged readers opportunities to understand and transcend their cognitive limitations.","[('Sarah Colvin', 'University of Cambridge')]",[],Wiley

Discussing the expansion of publishing enabled by digital and online technologies, we note that these changes did not reshape the demographics of most published works in the US, which remain overwhelmingly white authored. We then turn to literary prizes as an indicator of who writes prestige literature, narrating the twentieth-century formation of a racially segregated field and its slow changes against the backdrop of publishing overproduction. Combining a history of prestige literary culture with a demographic analysis of prizewinning writers (1918–2019), we discuss how a mostly white, New Critic-dominated field became the much more diverse and wide-ranging scene of the present. While this area has importantly opened up to writers of different backgrounds, our data show that the inequities of earlier prizegiving now take shape as drastic educational barriers to entry. Observing that a great deal of contemporary literature dramatizes the peculiarity of performing racial difference—often under the auspices of white audiences—we argue that the path to “excellence” has never been more narrow for writers who are not white, and Black writers in particular.","[('Claire Grossman', 'PhD candidate in English at Stanford University'), ('Juliana Spahr', 'Juliana Spahr’s most recent book is Du Bois’s Telegram (Harvard UP, 2018'), ('Stephanie Young', 'Director of Creative Writing at Mills College')]","['10.1215/00267929-3570689', '10.1353/cal.2017.0121', '10.1353/cal.1999.0049', '10.3368/cl.58.4.462']",Oxford University Press (OUP)
10.1093/alh/ajab008,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Driven by the Market: African American Literature after Urban Fiction,[],"Abstract Kenneth W. Warren’s What Was African American Literature? (2011) compelled literary historians to question deeply held assumptions about periodization and racial authorship. While critics have taken issue with Warren aligning African American literature with Jim Crow segregation, none has examined his account of what came after this conjuncture: namely, the market’s wholesale cooptation of Black writing. By following the career of African American popular novelist Omar Tyree, this essay shows how corporate publishers in the 1990s and 2000s redefined African American literature as a sales category, one that combined a steady stream of recognized authors with a mad dash for amateur talent. Tyree had been part of the first wave of self-published authors to be picked up by major New York houses. However, as soon as he was made to conform to the industry’s demands, Tyree was eclipsed by Black women writers who developed the hard-boiled romance genre known as urban fiction. As Tyree saw his literary fortunes fade, corporate publishing became increasingly reliant on Black book entrepreneurs to sustain the category of African American literature, thereby turning racial authorship into a vehicle for realizing profits.","[('Kinohi Nishikawa', 'associate professor of English and African American Studies at Princeton University')]",['10.2307/j.ctvjghtk7'],Oxford University Press (OUP)

I identify two basic mythical perspectives that have been crucial for the Czechs since the 19th century: the ‘particularist’ and the ‘universalist’. The latter originally only existed as a complement of the former, and it was not until 1968 that it was clearly expressed on its own (in its pro-Western version) in opposition to the particularist myth, eventually becoming the dominant narrative of the 1990s with their ethos of returning to the West. Once the post-revolutionary enthusiasm evaporated, however, the subsequent disillusion again came to be expressed through the particularist myth. While at present the universalist myth might seem as superior to the particularist one, from the perspective of theories of nationalism, both have their bright and dark sides, and it is only due to their present-day opposition that the particularist myth has taken the illiberal turn. A critical reflection of the limitations of both myths might allow us to soften their antagonism.","[('Radek Chlup', 'Charles University in Prague, Czechia')]","['10.4324/9780203561294', '10.1080/13537110600882627', '10.1080/09668130802434307', '10.1057/9780230292505', '10.1017/S0010417506000053', '10.1017/CBO9780511498626', '10.1017/CBO9781139059015', '10.3138/9781442625730', '10.1017/CBO9780511806247.006', '10.1080/14650040802203687', '10.1093/ips/oly002', '10.1525/can.1992.7.2.02a00030', '10.3817/1293094183', '10.1017/CBO9780511621727', '10.1002/9781118611463.wbielsi096', '10.1353/jod.2018.0049', '10.1017/CBO9780511550058', '10.1057/9780230605497', '10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001', '10.2478/jnmlp-2018-0008', '10.1017/9781108595841', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195367812.001.0001', '10.1080/009059999108948', '10.1515/9780691214436', '10.1080/01436597.2012.666016', '10.1177/0896920513501349', '10.1093/oso/9780198295341.001.0001', '10.1080/13569319808420780', '10.1080/21565503.2014.970561', '10.13060/00380288.2001.37.12.12', '10.1080/13563467.2019.1598960', '10.2307/2505361', '10.1353/see.2009.0084', '10.4324/9780203461815']",SAGE Publications

By 2019, all three of those legs have been turned upside down. China and Russia, among others, offer new ordering projects, countries enjoy “exit options” in the form of alternative patronage, and illiberal activist networks are in the ascendant. A closer look at the “why” and “how” makes clear that illiberal forces have appropriated and repurposed the toolkit used to expand liberal order, which suggests an apparent paradox. While some forms of liberal order—primarily on the political side—are in retreat, other forms of liberal order—especially in terms of institutional and multilateral arrangements—are being reinforced. We are, therefore, looking not at the end of liberal order, but at a third great transformation in it.","[('Alexander Cooley', 'Barnard College and Columbia University, USA'), ('Daniel H Nexon', 'Georgetown University, USA')]","['10.1017/S1537592709090033', '10.1080/09668130802292143', '10.1093/cjip/pop013', '10.1080/01436597.2018.1529539', '10.1017/CBO9781139087230', '10.3386/w23189', '10.1093/isq/sqw011', '10.1017/S0020818313000155', '10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.158', '10.1080/21599165.2018.1491401', '10.1353/jod.2015.0049', '10.1080/09636412.2019.1604988', '10.1093/oso/9780190916473.001.0001', '10.1017/S0260210519000019', '10.1057/s41311-018-0165-x', '10.1353/book.47469', '10.1017/S0020818304582073', '10.1017/S0022381613000066', '10.1111/j.1468-5965.2006.00650.x', '10.1017/S0020818318000206', '10.1177/0047117819834625', '10.1515/9781400846283', '10.1177/0022002705281669', '10.1093/ia/iiy026', '10.1017/S0020818313000398', '10.1162/002081802760199890', '10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.03.035', '10.1017/S0260210504006254', '10.2307/j.ctt7rjt2', '10.1080/09636412.2019.1604981', '10.1111/j.1468-2478.2007.00460.x', '10.7591/9781501700385', '10.1177/0022343399036001006', '10.1017/gov.2016.41', '10.1177/0305829810363509', '10.1177/1354066110380963', '10.1080/0163660X.2018.1445353', '10.1017/CBO9781316343890', '10.1162/isec_a_00342', '10.1017/CBO9780511676406', '10.1080/09512748.2016.1154678', '10.1162/002081897550456', '10.1017/CBO9780511811340', '10.7591/cornell/9780801450228.001.0001', '10.1093/ia/iix238', '10.1111/j.1468-2486.2011.01022.x', '10.1017/S0007123414000489', '10.1353/jod.2018.0041', '10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00765.x']",SAGE Publications

First, we provide the inventory of vocative forms used by Madrilenian teenagers, examine their origin and describe their semantic-pragmatic features, with special attention for the nominal vocative expressions used as symbols of in-group identity. The second part disentangles the pragmatic-discursive functions assumed by these forms, by taking into account the vocative’s multifunctionality.

Second, it suggests that scholars use the rich multiple meanings of the capacious Middle English verb endure as a set of ethical charges for approaching structural attitudes toward rape and consent in Chaucer’s work.","[('Carissa M.

10.1093/alh/ajaa028,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Mapping Taste: Urban Modernities from the Tatler and Spectator to Frederick Douglass' Paper,[],"AbstractThis essay, which is part of a larger book project, reflects my interest in rethinking concepts of Black modernity and speculating on its possible manifestations in different forms at different historical moments. Specifically, I posit the emergence of an urban Black modernity in US northern cities during the antebellum era. I begin by mapping a literary history of urban modernity in periodical culture over a span of 150 years. I examine its origins in Richard Steele’s Tatler (1709–11) and Joseph Addison and Steele’s Spectator (1711–12), which detail the rise of modern London and its new middle-class subjects, whose conspicuous consumption demanded the regulation of taste, deemed a crucial marker of modernity. This urban modernity is then reconfigured across the Atlantic in New York, specifically in Washington Irving’s Letters of Jonathan Oldstyle, Gent (1802) and Salmagundi (1807–08), which anatomize the behaviors of New York’s social elite. I then elucidate how a group of Black New York correspondents to Frederick Douglass’ Paper (1852–55)—notably James McCune Smith, William J. Wilson, and Philip Bell—take up and repurpose such representations of urban modernity to define the taste of the city’s Black urbanites and meet their intellectual, social, and political needs at mid-century.","[('Carla L Peterson', '')]","['10.4135/9781526401502', '10.9783/9780812293043', '10.9783/9780812293777', '10.5406/illinois/9780252036705.001.0001', '10.56021/9780801855887', '10.1215/9780822384144', '10.1515/9780822391517', '10.7591/cornell/9780801449499.001.0001', '10.18574/nyu/9781479885688.001.0001', '10.9783/9780812295771', '10.1057/9781137378248', '10.7208/chicago/9780226789439.001.0001']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

10.1093/melus/mlaa011,MELUS,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"Haunted Roadscapes in Jesmyn Ward's Sing, Unburied, Sing",[],"AbstractIn this article, I argue that Jesmyn Ward deploys a road trip in her 2017 novel Sing, Unburied, Sing as a literary formula through which she demonstrates the immobilizing effects of racism and incarceration on contemporary black lives. The association of the American road-trip novel with freedom and free movement is strong in the American imaginary, and Ward manipulates this association to explore what happens when automobile travelers are precarious rather than privileged. The road trip in Ward's novel makes visible various forces of mobility and immobility that differentiate citizens by race. She conjures two dimensions of the African American experience that are immobilizing: the carceral system and the risk of “driving while black.” Sing, Unburied, Sing already critiques the traditional road trip in its plot and narrative structure; for Ward, it is the linkages of dimensions of African American immobilization around the road trip that are powerful. Ward's novel demonstrates that black automobility, or the unique experience of the road for racialized drivers, reveals the political and social dynamics that shape our conception of the road for all drivers. Furthermore, I analyze how the road trip within the novel “unburies” a story about the violence of incarceration. I explore how Ward finesses that iconic American narrative trope, the journey by car that ought to be freeing, to heighten her critique of racist, anti-black structures of oppression in the United States.","[('Nicole Dib', 'University of California, Santa Barbara')]","['10.1080/13645145.2007.9634825', '10.1353/book.3297', '10.1163/9789042029149', '10.1525/9780520938038', '10.1215/9780822380382', '10.7208/chicago/9780226745657.001.0001', '10.2307/464747', '10.17953/aicrj.40.1.blu_wakpa']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Tracing the plantation’s environmental and infrastructural presence in the Gulf Coast and throughout the US South, this essay argues that the plantation’s presence is fundamentally gothic. Geomemory, a trope evident across the emerging canon of contemporary African American fiction, allows writers to address the representational challenge of infrastructural and spatial violence via a defamiliarizing chronotope in which past, present, and future come into uneasy contact. Further, geomemory’s particular enmeshment with spatial design and infrastructure means that it moves from identifying the modern afterlife of the plantation to situating the present in the long context of plantation modernity.","[('Rebecca Evans', '')]","['10.1215/9781478002031', '10.1215/9781478002031-002', '10.1086/448889', '10.7227/GS.16.1.1', '10.1093/isle/isp010', '10.1111/0033-0124.00310', '10.1215/22011919-3615934', '10.1080/00141844.2015.1105838', '10.1215/0041462X-2007-4007', '10.4324/9781315464930', '10.1146/annurev-anthro-092412-155522', '10.1080/14649365.2011.624280', '10.1215/07990537-2378892', '10.4324/9780203490013-11', '10.25158/L5.1.8', '10.1111/anti.12425', '10.5749/9781452962054']",Duke University Press

Following the financialization of the publishing industry, genre fiction became one of its most profitable forms. As a result, agents and houses sought to invest in brand-name authors who could attract a mass-market readership based on reputation alone. While this development helped turn King into one of the most successful novelists of the late twentieth century, it also provided an opportunity to engage with questions about authorial autonomy, the demands of the market, and the mediating force of publishers in his own work. Novels like Misery (1984) and the “Dark Tower” series (1982–2004)—explicitly centered on the writing of genre fiction—articulate a model of authorial professionalism built upon the metaphor of the corporation. Understanding genre as a corporate form need not be grounds for critical dismissal, but can instead serve a critical purpose. Genre fiction, this essay argues, functions as a mechanism for confronting the economic conditions and expectations of the contemporary publishing industry and its impact on literary production.","[('Angela S Allan', 'lecturer on History & Literature at Harvard University')]","['10.1111/jpcu.12143', '10.1057/9780230287495', '10.1111/j.1540-5931.2011.00883.x', '10.4324/9780203023365', '10.1093/oso/9780199283262.001.0001', '10.1353/asa.2016.0007', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199372874.001.0001', '10.1525/9780520406599', '10.7312/mart18192', '10.1215/00267929-3570689', '10.2307/j.ctvjsf59f', '10.1215/00029831-7335385', '10.3368/cl.58.4.462']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Collection 212, inventory 1, storage units 4 and 5). The research was conducted in three main areas: selection of information for the letter style alphabet; comparative analysis of sources (manuscripts and publications of handwritten text) for the purpose of identifying and correcting errors in its reading; a review of calligraphy and graphics of Feodor Dostoevsky. The alphabet of letter styles allows to establish typical and atypical letter styles in the handwriting of Feodor Dostoevsky. This made it possible to compile a classification of letters, describe their features, and use this information in the study of difficult-to-read and previously undecipherable records. The latter may contain valuable information that allows to clarify the facts in the creative history of the works of Feodor Dostoevsky, biographical information, chronology of the creative process, and so on. The second area of research includes the comparative analysis of manuscript sources and their published versions — is of particular value for ascertaining the original author's text and eliminating the inaccuracies of research interpretations that often appear in the process of manuscript publishing. There is a direct connection between these areas of analysis — the letter style alphabet is a tool that allows to read the handwritten text more accurately and correct the mistakes of the publishers. The third direction, dedicated to the study of calligraphy, expands the range of tasks related to the study of graphics in the writer's texts and allows to draw preliminary conclusions about the nature of its function in the handwritten text. The scientific novelty of the work consists in the systematization of data on the writer's handwriting in manuscripts of the specified period, on the features of his creative work, and in correcting the errors made by publishers of handwritten materials and restoring the true meaning of the author's notes. The practical value of the work consists in collecting information about the writer's handwriting, which is relevant for the textual analysis of his works, publication of his texts, and use of the collected information for subsequent scientific work.","[('Nataliya Tarasova', ''), ('Tatyana Panyukova', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University
10.1093/melus/mlz057,MELUS,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"Postquantum: A Tale for the Time Being, Atomik Aztex, and Hacking Modern Space-Time",[],"AbstractThis study identifies the postquantum novel as an emerging subgenre of speculative ethnic fiction that challenges the prevailing logic of Western space-time in contemporary literature. In contrast with archetypal twentieth-century literary modes such as modernism, postmodernism, and science fiction, postquantum fiction strays from classical and quantum mechanics—and Western science more broadly—as default knowledge systems and instead turns to premodern, indigenous, and non-Western epistemes as equally valid intellectual frameworks for representing reality. Drawing from philosophy of science and postcolonial theory, this study reads Zen Buddhism in Ruth Ozeki’s A Tale for the Time Being (2013) and the Meso-American calendrical sciences in Sesshu Foster’s Atomik Aztex (2005) as alternative logics of space-time and argues that the postquantum novel destabilizes many of the physicalist assumptions undergirding temporality and spatiality in twenty-first-century narrative. Postquantum fiction thus constitutes an original form of epistemological critique that decolonizes Western scientific hegemony in literature via ethnoscientific theory and praxis while also expanding the social justice concerns of ethnofuturism to include traditional and marginalized knowledge.","[('Derek Lee', 'Georgia Institute of Technology')]","['10.4324/9780203625002', '10.2979/JML.2009.32.3.39', '10.1525/rep.1992.37.1.99p0090f', '10.1515/9780691219608', '10.1632/003081205X52428', '10.1215/9780822393849', '10.7560/731394', '10.1080/17449855.2015.1105856', '10.1353/jaas.2017.0006', '10.1017/CBO9780511862656', '10.1057/9780230356054', '10.14325/mississippi/9781628461237.001.0001', '10.1353/ari.2018.0001', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195320930.001.0001', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198160021.001.0001', '10.1353/lm.2008.0010', '10.36019/9780813570655', '10.1093/alh/ajr026', '10.1093/melus/mlv059', '10.18574/nyu/9781479800070.001.0001', '10.1215/9780822386285', '10.1007/s13280-014-0501-3', '10.1353/jaas.2016.0020', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199546961.001.0001', '10.1353/arq.2011.0031', '10.1093/isle/ist088']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Yet, three decades on, Ukraine’s democracy remains ineffective and superficial. It is thus productive—and apposite—to seek an alternative method for studying such a complicated and multidimensional problem. This article employs “causal layered analysis” (CLA), developed in Futures Studies to gain additional insight into the reasons for Ukraine’s incomplete and halting democratization. CLA aims to get to the underlying causes of problems and involves analysis at four “layers”: litany, system, worldview, and myth/metaphor. As we demonstrate here, this method can be fruitfully applied to better understand Ukraine’s democratization—or, rather, its lack of it. At the layer of litany, the main facts and data concerning democracy in Ukraine are summarized. The second—systemic layer—is related to the study of democratic transition based on the approaches of various academic disciplines and theories. The research at the third layer is concerned with interpretation of the problem within the framework of five worldviews. At the deepest layer, we identify and characterize some of the myths underlying the aforementioned worldviews. Based on these analyses, key problems are identified and prospects for the future democratization of Ukraine are outlined.","[('Yaryna Turchyn', 'Lviv Polytechnic National University, Ukraine'), ('Petro Sukhorolskyi', 'Lviv Polytechnic National University, Ukraine'), ('Iryna Sukhorolska', 'Lviv Polytechnic National University, Ukraine')]","['10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0008', '10.1007/978-1-349-27627-1_2', '10.1080/13510340412331304615', '10.1177/0888325411401379', '10.1353/jod.2002.0003', '10.1017/CBO9780511510519.004', '10.4324/9780203466247', '10.56021/9780801860140', '10.1017/CBO9780511625046', '10.1016/j.jce.2008.01.001', '10.1007/s11558-019-09344-2', '10.1007/BF02686166', '10.4324/9780203148433-1', '10.1016/S1053-5357(01)00119-6', '10.2307/422444', '10.1016/S0016-3287(98)00086-X', '10.1016/j.futures.2009.09.002', '10.1162/016366000560665', '10.1017/CBO9780511790881', '10.1017/S1537592710001258', '10.1080/14608944.2013.843515', '10.1016/0967-067X(94)90006-X', '10.1080/714000202', '10.1111/1467-9256.00115', '10.1177/0888325410388410', '10.1016/j.postcomstud.2019.10.007', '10.56021/9780801890734', '10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0011', '10.2307/1951731', '10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00595.x', '10.1007/978-3-030-17997-7_14', '10.1093/oso/9780198837886.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9780511559211.009', '10.1353/jod.1996.0016', '10.1017/S0007123400009789', '10.1111/j.1477-7053.1996.tb01202.x', '10.1353/jod.1991.0033', '10.1177/0888325401015001002', '10.1111/1475-6765.00086', '10.1177/2336825X1902700307']",SAGE Publications

In order to historicize the transpacific settler colonial condition's coarticulation with Asian American political subjectivity, ever since the Asian American Movement of the Long Sixties, this article turns to two works of Asian American historical fiction: Shawn Wong's Homebase (1979), one of the first self-identified works of Asian American literature, and Viet Thanh Nguyen's The Sympathizer (2015), a contemporary best-selling novel. Both texts call attention to the interconnected nature of Indigenous sovereignty struggles across the continental United States, Guam, and Vietnam and grapple with the vexed positionality of Asian American subjects who at times uphold transpacific settler colonialism and at other times resist it.

Their persuasive potential has been extensively highlighted in the literature. Some studies have identified general tendencies in the use of encapsulators in thematic or rhematic positions. However, the parameters influencing the preference for thematic or rhematic encapsulators have not been specifically addressed with quantitative data. The aim of this article is to analyse those parameters in a corpus of newspaper editorials. We have selected several parameters, most of them related to their evaluative and/or persuasive potential, that might influence the use of encapsulators in the thematic-rhematic progression. Rhematic encapsulators are slightly more frequent, but we show that there are no clear correlations between each pair of parameters. Although evaluation seems to play a role (the most evaluative encapsulators tend to appear in rhematic positions), we try to show that this is mediated by many other factors that make encapsulation a less predictable type of referential expression. We also reflect on the importance of other parameters, i.e. cognitive (accessibility) and textual (genre).","[('Ramón González Ruiz', 'Universidad de Navarra , Departamento de Filología , Edif.

The pre-electoral period was marked by the announcement of boycott from opposition, followed by a number of attempts of ruling party to mitigate the potential negative effects. The decision of opposition to restrain from participation came as a response to the long-term accusations of heavily biased electoral and media conditions, which culminated in EU-mediated (but largely unsuccessful) roundtable talks in 2019. On a larger scale, the administration headed by the President Aleksandar Vučić is becoming increasingly authoritarian, with several indices now classifying Serbia as a hybrid regime. As expected, the elections brought a convincing victory to Vučić’s Serbian Progressive Party, which won 188 out of 250 seats. Despite the overwhelming triumph, government was formed more than four months later. This paper is contributing to the literature on actors’ strategies in hybrid regimes. Although only short-term effects of the boycott could be assessed, the 2020 elections in Serbia demonstrate that legitimacy of the regime cannot be endangered if the opposition is not supported by international actors, and moreover, that the election results have only strengthened the regime.","[('Dejan Bursać', 'Institute for Political Studies, Serbia'), ('Dušan Vučićević', 'University of Belgrade, Serbia')]","['10.1007/978-3-030-27693-5_21', '10.1080/21599165.2018.1490272', '10.1007/978-3-030-22149-2', '10.1353/jod.2002.0003', '10.2307/2759366', '10.1515/9781685858452', '10.1353/jod.1995.0049', '10.1163/18763332-04201004', '10.1177/001041407901200101', '10.1353/jod.2002.0026', '10.1515/9781685857479-014', '10.1017/CBO9780511781353', '10.1515/9789639776999', '10.1353/jod.1994.0010', '10.1080/14683857.2019.1672929', '10.1080/13501763.2019.1578815', '10.1177/0192512102023001006', '10.1515/9781685857479', '10.1177/0192512114535450', '10.1080/09668136.2019.1669534']",SAGE Publications

Having visited Mexico, Europe, and West Africa before he turned twenty-two, Hughes eventually also made his way to the Soviet Union, Japan, and China in 1933. At the age of thirty-one, he accomplished what none of his contemporaries or predecessors had been able to achieve—to rewrite the public image of African Americans in the Chinese cultural and intellectual imagination. Crucially, his visit to China pushed beyond the limits of black internationalism as he responded to American and European global hegemony through using China as an experimental ground. At a time when the Soviet Union held center stage in communist revolutionary thought, Hughes's Chinese encounters challenged the assumption within the American and African American communities that China was largely irrelevant in the discourse of proletarianism. The internationalist perspectives that he obtained from the sojourn offered him a powerful tool to communicate the struggles of black citizenship at home in a global context. It stimulated a racial consciousness that defied national, geographical, and political boundaries of the US color line.","[('Selina Lai-Henderson', 'Duke Kunshan University')]","['10.1215/9780822383833', '10.2307/j.ctt1p6qr3x', '10.1215/9780822376095', '10.1017/S1742058X13000040', '10.1017/CCOL052185699X', '10.1215/9780822380436', '10.18574/nyu/9780814742976.001.0001', '10.1353/book.3226', '10.1080/10999949909362183', '10.7312/columbia/9780231173520.001.0001', '10.1632/pmla.2013.128.1.156', '10.1093/oso/9780195120547.001.0001', '10.1515/9781503625259', '10.7312/wash15270', '10.1017/CCOL052182592X']",Oxford University Press (OUP)
10.1093/alh/ajaa024,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"An Unexpected Direction: Pauline Hopkins, S. E. F. C. C. Hamedoe, and ""The Dark Races of the Twentieth Century""",[],"AbstractThis essay mines the earliest and most influential of African American literary magazines, the Boston-based Colored American Magazine (CAM) (1900–09), and its southern rival, the Atlanta-based Voice of the Negro (1904–07), to investigate how black writers and activists addressed the links between US race relations, settler colonialism, and empire in the Pacific. Spanning these two periodicals, Pauline Hopkins’s work as an editor and contributor grappled with the question of how to represent, engage, and position Black Americans in a globalizing world that was at once becoming more vast, heterogeneous, and integrated. Race remained a powerful structuring principle, yet it accrued dynamic new meanings in the era of new imperialism. Along the way, the essay investigates an unexplored facet of Hopkins’s authorship and compositional style. It speculates that Hopkins may have published under another as yet unattributed pen name. The enigmatic S. E. F. C. C. Hamedoe was one of the most significant of regular CAM contributors. Before disappearing from print history, Hamedoe published a four-year-long series that mapped the political contours of the emerging Global South, crisscrossing continents and oceans.

On Cecily Chaumpaigne, Cancellation, and the English Literary Canon",[],"ABSTRACT While Euan Roger and Sebastian Sobecki’s new archival discovery absolves Geoffrey Chaucer of the supposed rape of Cecily Chaumpaigne, it does not offer an absolution for the literary critics and historians who have exploited and appropriated the imagined figure of Cecily Chaumpaigne for the sexual titillation of themselves and their reading public. Briefly recounting the last century and a half of Chaucerian historiography, this article argues that the study of Chaucerian literature remains a place in which sexual violence has been exalted, before concluding that the transformations that feminist scholarship has brought to the field—especially in relation to the Chaumpaigne release—will never be erased.","[('Samantha Katz Seal', 'University of New Hampshire Durham, New Hampshire (samantha.seal@unh.edu)')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

Yet across literature of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, medieval writers fixated upon the figure of the spouse who was unwilling to have sex with his or her partner. This marked attention suggests that while marital consent was a closed discussion in the realm of medieval law, it remained open and alive in the literary imagination. In the Canterbury Tales, Chaucer presents a range of unwilling spouses, from saint's life to romance to fabliau. As Chaucer remixes theories of consent across genres, the Canterbury Tales makes its most radical statement on marital consent in the fabliau. In the Shipman's Tale, the wife's negotiation of her own multiple sexual relationships denaturalizes the basic assumptions of marital consent, opening up the imaginative space necessary to theorize marital rape.","[('Chelsea Skalak', 'Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, (skalakc@dickinson.edu)')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

The analysis also focuses on the interplay of the Pluperfect with competing past tense forms, the perfective Simple Past and the Perfect.

10.1093/alh/ajac001,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,The Black Situation: Notes on Black Critical Theory Now,[],"Abstract This essay argues that what some critics have dubbed an ontological turn in Black critical theory—the tendency to theorize racial antagonisms in general and antiblackness in particular as a function of the “being” of the West—reflects a more general pessimism endemic to our historical moment. That pessimism has been catalyzed by the collapse of meaningful alternatives in the postcolonial, post-communist moment, which results in occluded or obscured pathways to collective striving and worldmaking. One important response to the ontological turn has seen critics turn to Black culture to highlight peculiar modes of subjectivity shaped, but not defined by, ongoing racial antagonism. As Black particularity in this account remains implicit or intuitive, insofar as Black particularity remains a given rather than theorized, this tendency proves to be the other’s flipside rather than alternative. This essay concludes by proposing that rather than studying culture to understand Black life, one study Black life to understand cultural production. The titular “Black situation” is its term for historical materialist analysis attuned to the complex modalities through which racial antagonism appears in daily life as well as the compulsions that impede sovereign individual agency.","[('Anthony Reed', '')]","['10.1353/aq.2011.0020', '10.1215/07990537-1665416', '10.1215/9781478012573', '10.2307/j.ctv120qr1w', '10.1080/1350463032000101579', '10.2307/j.ctv11cw61k']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Accordingly, the purpose and objectives of the article are to explicate the terminological thesaurus of the “gospel text,” which functions in Dostoevsky-related research and contains the key concepts of general (theoretical) poetics, historical poetics, ethnopoetics, theology and philosophy. A thesaurus approach is implemented in the study of this terminology, integrating “machine analysis” and “human interpretation” of the source data. The presented terminological dictionary is quite representational of the current state of Dostoevsky’s gospel text studies. The visual results of its digital processing clearly show the trend towards the joint use of poetological, theological and philosophical categories. It is therefore concluded that the analysis of the terminological thesaurus is productive in assessing the integrity of the metalanguage of Dostoevsky’s gospel text studies, a language that in its current state is characterized by great interdiscursivity.","[('Valentina Borisova', ''), ('Sergey Shaulov', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University

These configurations show some grammatical traits and a geographical variation which have not yet been inquiried into. These structures, as it is argued in this paper, may host two different types of resumptive pronouns: what will be called asymmetric resumption, triggered by subject-object asymmetries; and resumption as a case-matching mechanism, available in non-matching semi-free relative clauses. As for the head of the construction, dialects of Peninsular Spanish are grouped into those which resort to the explicit pronoun and those which show a propensity to use the implicit pronominal category. The variant headed by the implicit pronoun is similar in some respects to relative clause extraposition, but some new data are brought to the fore that distinguish one construction from the other.","[('Jorge Agulló', 'Universidad Autónoma de Madrid , Campus de Cantoblanco, calle Francisco Tomás y Valiente 1, Despacho 104 (Módulo VI-Bis) , Madrid Spain')]","['10.7557/1.7.1.4405', '10.32714/ricl.05.01', '10.31819/9783954877874', '10.4324/9781315713441-64', '10.3406/scoli.2004.1061', '10.1075/sl.31.1.02car', '10.1515/9783110346060.477', '10.1017/CBO9780511554261', '10.1023/B:NALA.0000005564.33961.e0', '10.2307/413321', '10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.013.56', '10.1075/tsl.102.09epp', '10.3989/rfe.1994.v74.i1/2.499', '10.1515/cogl.2010.002', '10.1515/IBER.2002.1.1', '10.3989/rfe.1983.v63.i1/2.534', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199252695.001.0001', '10.1515/9783110377088-005', '10.7557/1.9.1.5098', '10.1344/AFEL2014.4.7', '10.2307/414342', '10.2307/412588', '10.1017/S002222670000520X', '10.1017/S0022226797006853', '10.1075/slcs.124', '10.1515/joll.1980.1.1.47', '10.1075/slcs.12.16mar', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199677108.003.0045', '10.1515/9783110377088-022', '10.1515/9783110253412.427', '10.1515/9783110923582.273', '10.54166/rhle.2008.03.04', '10.24201/nrfh.v31i2.1773', '10.1017/S0022226700009865', '10.1515/9783110207552.115', '10.1075/li.2.1.08ruw', '10.1163/9789004437500_004', '10.1111/j.1467-968X.2008.00211.x', '10.1515/9783110882704', '10.1075/cilt.26.18sun', '10.1002/9780470996591.ch27', '10.4067/S0718-93032019000100307']",Walter de Gruyter GmbH

Claims that AI systems automate and expedite creativity reflect industry and research priorities of speed, scale, optimization, and frictionlessness driving much artificial intelligence design and application. But poetry will not optimize; the creative process cannot be reduced to a prompt. Some have noted that literary creations generated or augmented by artificial intelligence at best can offer form without meaning; using a GPT creation prompted by Maya Angelou’s poem “Still I Rise” as a case study, this essay argues that NLP’s predictive language generation and what I call algorithmic ahistoricity can also, more disturbingly, render meaning senseless. In doing so, GPT-3’s literary experiments are not “failed” because they do not meet some moving target of a literary standard, nor because of technological insufficiency, but because it can make it harder for people to name and navigate their realities.

The material for this part of the research was obtained from the most respectable foreign and Russian Internet portals, which display historical and literary collections and funds associated with various cultural traditions and personas.

This is, however, the starting point for a methodology that combines historiographical techniques with philological ones: the so-called material philology. Thus, the different sections of this cancionero are analyzed with ecdotic and philological criteria, from which the following is concluded: a) The textual stage of the Coplas de la vita Christi is immediately before its printed version and should be singled out in front of the testimony of the cancionero SA4a; b) the works that are copied next have differences of order, of duplicity and of mutilations with respect to the print form by Centenera in 1483, but they are undoubtedly a codex descriptus of this; c) it is delimited and confirms the materiality of the three printed sewn after Íñigo de Mendoza’s cancionero, whose dating coincides with the period of Isabel as queen of Portugal; d) it is determined that, like the three printed forms incorporated into this manuscript, the copy of the Repertorio de los tiempos comes from the incunabulum printed by Fadrique de Basilea in 1493 and not the one produced by Juan de Burgos in 1495. As a main conclusion, this cancionero is framed in the environment of the Catholic Monarchs and is attributed to Martín de Mendieta, a chamber man of the queen and of the Princess Isabel, from whom he keeps part of her personal books a few years after her death.","[('Josep-Lluís Martos', '')]",[],Universidad de Navarra

Visual Iconographies of Racial Contagion,[],"Abstract Contagion media have historically performed the dual functions of scientific and ideological persuasion, often deploying an iconography of racial contagion that combines these two functions. In efforts to halt the spread of the virus, health, science, and media organizations create visual imagery to teach the public to imagine we can see and therefore avoid contaminants that are invisible to the naked eye. Comparison of COVID-19 with other global disease outbreaks shows how a core set of contagion media visualizations are repeatedly deployed with subtle adaptations for unique diseases and display interfaces. The variations among different corpora of contagion media point to the interplay among persistent, transhistorical tropes, particular sites of meaning production, and novel technical affordances. This article will examine a subset of these representational techniques, including microscopic images of the virus, close-ups of disease vectors, global and local maps of contagion, health workers in biohazard suits, and visibly ill patients. The essay argues that techniques for visualizing the invisible produce a narrative logic of causality in COVID-19 that reinforces racist and xenophobic discourses of containment and control with direct and deadly consequences. Mitigation of this pandemic and future pandemics will require not only medical but also representational interventions.","[('Kirsten Ostherr', '')]","['10.1038/s41467-017-00923-8', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816683574.001.0001', '10.2307/1519765', '10.1038/d41586-020-00364-2', '10.2307/2928741', '10.2105/AJPH.93.7.1046', '10.1371/journal.pntd.0003257', '10.2105/AJPH.2019.305262', '10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5', '10.1136/bmj.302.6772.338', '10.1136/bmj.311.7015.1272', '10.1038/nature06536', '10.1515/9781400820412', '10.1093/phr/116.5.474', '10.1001/jama.2020.5317', '10.1080/08949468.2016.1131484', '10.1080/01459740.2017.1423072', '10.17351/ests2016.74', '10.2307/3397564']",Duke University Press

I. F. Masanov's article on Dostoevsky in the authoritative Dictionary of Pseudonyms contains errors and repetitions. Fyodor Dostoevsky signed his literary works with his personal name: Fyodor Dostoevsky, F. M. Dostoevsky, or, more often, F. Dostoevsky. On the contrary, the writer preferred to work as a journalist anonymously, more rarely — under pseudonyms. The range of Fyodor Dostoevsky's pseudonyms should be clarified. It is necessary to exclude “N. N.” from the list of pseudonyms, remove repeat “—y, M.” и “M. —y”, leave Dostoevsky's personal pseudonym “Zuboskalov” and add a new pseudonym “Ch. Komitetskiy”. The insert in the “Chronicler's notes” article is not the proper basis to make N. N. Strahov's pseudonym “Letopisets” (Epokha. 1865. № 1) a collective one or assign it to Dostoevsky. Most of Dostoevsky's pseudonyms are of an occasional nature, they are isolated and random. The names and surnames of real persons (M. Dostoevsky, A. Poretsky) in the role of his pseudonyms are accidental. As a result of critical analysis, it was established that in his literary and journalistic activities Dostoevsky used both regular (“F.

10.15393/j10.art.2020.5121,NEIZVESTNYI DOSTOEVSKII-THE UNKNOWN DOSTOEVSKY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Darovoe Estate and Its Owner (According to New Archival Documents),[],"The Dostoevsky family acquired the Darovoe estate in the Kashirsky uyezd of the Tula province on August 7, 1831. Here the future writer and his brothers and sisters spent the happy summer months in 1832–1836. The estate included the manor house (“seltso”) of Darovoye, the village of Darovaya, and land in the Nechaeva, Tripolye, Harina, Shelepova, and Chertkova wastelands. From the late 18th century to 1829, the listed territories belonged to the Kashirsky uezd landowner Vasily Khotyaintsev, then to his sons Peter, Nikolai and Vasily, and subsequently to their grandsons Pavel and Ivan Khotyaintsev. The latter owner sold the estate to O. A. Glagolevskaya in 1829, and she, in turn, sold it to the mother of the writer F. M. Dostoevsky. In February 1833, her husband, M. A. Dostoevsky, expanded the estate by purchasing the neighboring village of Cheremoshnya with the namesake wastelands. In 1840, after the death of their parents, the Dostoevsky brothers and sisters: Mikhail, Fyodor, Varvara, Andrey, Vera, Nikolai and Alexandra became the owners of the Darovoe estate. In 1852, the estate was bought from them by the writer’s younger sister, Vera Mikhailovna Ivanova (nee Dostoevskaya). After her, Darovoe and Cheremoshnya were owned by her children. The authors analyzed the documents from the Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts, The State Archive of the Tula region, The Central State Archive of the City of Moscow, and the Department of Manuscripts of the Russian State Library. The archival materials revealed the circumstances of the change of ownership of the hamlet and the village of Darovoe and the incident changes from the late 18th century to 1852. It also revealed the details of the purchase of the village of Darovoe by M. F. Dostoevskaya and the exact date of acquisition of the village of Cheremoshnya by M. A. Dostoevsky (February 16, 1833). The study revealed the circumstances of the transfer of the estate to V. M. Ivanova and date of transaction (October 20, 1852), and named the participants of the division. F. M. Dostoevsky, who previously refused his share of the inheritance, did not participate in it. This article is the first to publish the mortgages on Darovoe and Cheremoshnya in 1833, the plan of the hamlet of Darovoe with the manor house dated 1847 (the closest in time to the memorial period), as well as the 1852 act of division, which specifies the conditions for the acquisition by V. M. Ivanova of the parental estate, its size and composition.","[('Tatyana Dementyeva', ''), ('Lyubov Voronkina', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University
10.1093/alh/ajac066,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"Critical Darlings, Critical Dogs: Joseph O'Neill and What Contemporary Criticism Doesn't Want",[],"AbstractThis essay argues that the drive within literary studies to name new paradigms obscures key historical continuities in contemporary fiction. To explore this problem, I turn to Joseph O’Neill’s The Dog (2014), a novel mostly panned or ignored by critics. The Dog courts its status as an outcast by confounding readers’ expectations of novelty. It refuses to showcase supposed aesthetic progress made in the wake of postmodernism. It also forces readers to revisit the Reagan-Thatcher years, bearing us backward on an economic tide when we hoped that culture, technology, and literature might be hurtling us forward. O’Neill’s satire bites heralds of experimental fiction by challenging the belief that new novelistic techniques could alter neoliberal market societies. The Dog attends to new forms of global transit and digital media, but insists that its own aesthetic horizons are still shaped by economic formations and literary forms that coalesced during the 1980s. Its failure to gain academic adherents reveals two underlying urges on the part of the critical establishment: the urge to transcend the stale horizons of the postmodern through novel periodization and the urge to exit the neoliberal order through art.","[('Sarah Wasserman', '')]","['10.1215/0041462X-2007-4002', '10.1017/CBO9780511902727', '10.1017/9781108985598', '10.1353/jnt.2011.0090', '10.1017/9781108583787', '10.1215/03335372-4265143', '10.2307/j.ctt20q23p0', '10.1257/jep.27.2.3', '10.56021/9781421423104', '10.1093/alh/ajm044', '10.5070/T871021714', '10.1017/CBO9781139108706', '10.1515/9780804783217', '10.1257/jep.27.2.73', '10.1093/alh/ajz034', '10.1093/alh/ajn040', '10.1017/CBO9781316155035', '10.1353/cli.2013.0029', '10.2307/j.ctv7fmfvx']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The object of textual analysis was the manuscript of Dostoevsky's first “Siberian ode” “On European Events in 1854”, the publication of which in several authoritative periodicals addressed the issue in different ways. In the academic Complete Works of Dostoevsky (1st and 2nd editions), the manuscript of the poem, which is stored in the State Archives of the Russian Federation (fund of the III Department), is qualified as a fair copy, although not without hesitation. In the Petrozavodsk Complete Collected Works (“Canonical Texts”), the status of the manuscript is established as a clerical copy. The article shows that the discrepancy in the conclusions of authoritative textual critics is due to the uniqueness of this manuscript, which is written in a special type of handwriting with elements of calligraphy, where numerous letter styles comply with the patterns recorded in the educational copybooks of the 1830–1850s. When establishing the status of the manuscript, the method of double comparison of the handwriting used, on the one hand, with calligraphic notes from Dostoevsky's 1860s workbooks, and on the other hand, with samples from educational copybooks. This allowed to identify a number of individual features characteristic of the writer in the handwriting version with elements of calligraphy, primarily in the inscriptions of capital letters, and to firmly establish that it is a fair copy. At the same time, handwriting analysis allowed to draw a conclusion about Dostoevsky’s special psychological state in April 1854, three months after he came out of prison. At that time he was working on the manuscript of the patriotic poem “On European Events in 1854”, intended for sending by official means to the capital with the hope of being published in “St. Petersburg Vedomosti”.","[('Boris Tikhomirov', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University

In the XIX–XX centuries, a corpus of texts, which were unambiguously attributed to F. M. Dostoevsky, M. M. Dostoevsky, A. A. Grigoriev, N. N. Strakhov and other Vremya and Epokha authors, was formed on the basis of traditional documentary (letters, payroll, income and expense book, memoirs), ideological and thematic and stylistic evidence. The following types of texts were isolated within the corpus of anonymous and pseudonymous articles, author's and collective articles, editorial inserts, notes; by type of writing - authorship, co-authorship, editing and adaptation of others texts. Modern methods of statistical analysis of formal grammatical and syntactic parameters in the text can provide sufficient grounds for expanding the source attribution base. This article presents the results of a study of a number of anonymous articles in the Dostoevsky brothers' journals using three statistical methods of attribution: linguistic and statistical analysis according to the G.

10.1093/alh/ajab007,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"""Something is Said in the Silences"": Gwendolyn Brooks's Years at Harper's",[],"Abstract This essay draws upon Gwendolyn Brooks’ 49-year correspondence (1944–93) with her editor Elizabeth Lawrence to trace the “publishing knowledges” that Brooks gleaned during her mid-20th-century career with the US firm Harpers &amp; Brothers. First and foremost, their correspondence richly details Brooks’s growth as an experimental poet with a mainstream commercial firm. The aesthetic sociality of their editorial debates fostered also allowed them to explore personal and political intimacies; in this dimension, their correspondence (both the letters’ contents and epistolary form) sheds light on how Brooks and Lawrence navigated the shoals of race, gender, and liberalism in the notoriously patriarchal corporate culture of mid-20th-century US publishing. Finally, the arc of Brooks’s relationship with Lawrence at Harper’s charts is how US publishing transformed from its corporate to conglomerated forms. Taken together, these epistolary threads not only weave African American poetry into the literary history of an era-defining institutional realignment but also they demonstrate how Brooks’ and Lawrence’s cross-racial solidarity and commitment to an anti-corporate poetics comprise a continuum between Brooks’s career in mainstream US publishing and her later years in the Black independent press in the late 1960s.

After the Civil War, Still wrote a book based on his records of their stories. The discrimination Black writers and readers experienced from the publishing business convinced Still to start his own. Still’s publishing business, like the movement his book documented, was the work of a collective. He called on family members, allies in reform, and friends in Black periodical publishing to produce and distribute the book. Still promoted the book and the business as an extension of the liberation movement. The labors of the fugitives he had helped, and of the booksellers he employed, would stimulate the economic progress, and protect the political and social gains, for which African Americans were striving.Still, a race man and a businessman, proposed a solution to the inequitable production and distribution of Black books. “The time has come,” he declared, “for colored men to be writing books &amp; selling them too.”","[('Alex W Black', '')]","['10.1086/pbsa.93.1.24304371', '10.9783/9780812206296.40', '10.1093/alh/aji042', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190237080.001.0001', '10.1215/9780822384144', '10.1093/alh/ajx003', '10.1353/bh.1998.0013', '10.2307/j.ctvgs08p1.7']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

How the European New Right imagines a post-liberal world order,[],"Far-right parties and pundits are often portrayed as parochial nationalists obsessed with the idea of national sovereignty. Opposed to a liberal world order, they prefer a rogue world of nation-states on the loose. This essay seeks to complicate that narrative. It suggests that alongside political parties with a nationalist agenda, an increasing number of voices on the radical Right are now pushing for a re-spiritualized world order in which cultures, civilizations, and empires are to set the scene. This vision of global order echoes Christopher Coker’s recent claim that “we now live in a world in which civilization is fast becoming the currency of international politics.” But, why does this strand of the far-right prefer civilizations to nation-states? To ponder this question, this essay zooms in on the European New Right and more precisely two of its main luminaries, Alain de Benoist and Aleksandr Dugin. It shows how the New Right stretches back to classical geopolitics to imagine a future polycentric world order in which large civilizations are set free from American hegemony. The empires of the future are no longer underpinned by nation-states but by ethnopluralism—a “blossoming variety” of local, ethnic, agrarian polities.","[('Manni Crone', 'Danish Institute for International Studies, København, Denmark')]","['10.1093/ips/olaa001', '10.1353/sor.2013.0020', '10.1080/14782800802500981', '10.1111/j.1749-5687.2010.00102.x', '10.1080/14650040701305609', '10.2747/1539-7216.50.2.131', '10.1017/S0037677900024566', '10.1017/S0260210519000159', '10.1177/0263276406067095', '10.3817/0393099081', '10.1017/S175297191800012X', '10.1017/S0260210521000103', '10.4324/9781315626628-8', '10.3817/0393099127', '10.1080/00168890903291443', '10.2307/20045621', '10.1093/ia/iix241', '10.1177/0309132513517989', '10.1111/1467-8675.12126', '10.1093/oso/9780190877583.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9780511521782', '10.1080/21567689.2019.1697870', '10.1111/1467-8675.12127', '10.1080/09668136.2017.1285009', '10.2307/j.ctv1131grs', '10.4159/harvard.9780674726383', '10.4324/9781315628059']",SAGE Publications

My essay considers the literary representation of this fusgeyer movement over time as a conduit upholding transcultural networks of memory work in the United States. To that end, I will examine the representation of fusgeyers in the literature produced by immigrant fusgeyers to the United States immediately after emigration (M. E. Ravage’s 1917 An American in the Making: The Life Story of an Immigrant and Jacob Finkelstein’s 1942 “Memoirs of a Fusgeyer from Romania to America”) and in the literature created in contemporary times in the United States (Stuart Tower’s 2003 historical novel The Wayfarers). In my analysis, I rely on Astrid Erll’s demonstration that literature can be a powerful conduit of cultural memory by its use of “four modes of a ‘rhetoric of collective memory’: the experiential, the mythical, the antagonistic, and the reflexive mode.” I will show which of these modes of rhetoric apply to the literary works I consider and how they highlight a dynamic movement toward a transcultural type of rhetoric shaping Jewish memory forms in contemporary US literature.","[('Dana Mihăilescu', 'University of Bucharest')]","['10.18574/nyu/9780814720202.003.0005', '10.1515/9783110207262.6.389', '10.1080/13534645.2011.605570', '10.1515/9783110217384', '10.1080/14623529908413937', '10.1093/melus/mlv007']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Viktorovich,[],"The article presents a systematic analysis of the Russian press of 1880, which actively responded to Dostoevsky’s Pushkin Speech. The interpretive boom around his speech is of particular interest for the study of the formative processes of public and national consciousness in Russia. In the history of journalism, the debates that took place at that time can be equated with modern information wars. At the same time, this episode is one of the decisive ones for the ‘Dostoevsky problem’ in criticism and, more broadly, in the Russian public consciousness. The “Pushkin Speech” was obviously of a unifying nature, but it, and even more so the 1880 “A Writer’s Diary,” caused a severe split in journalism, which reflected the mindset of the Russian society. At first, there is a change of semantic accents in telegrams and correspondence, and then the key concept of ""panhumanity"" is presented exclusively as a “dream” in publications opposing Dostoevsky, one that is not only incompatible with reality, but also distracts from pressing socio-economic problems. There is also an expansion in meaning in the form of the notorious “messianism” of Dostoevsky. The most commonly used concept used by journalists that are hostile to the writer is mysticism as a euphemism for faith. In parallel, a different understanding of the Pushkin speech is being formed in some publications (Mysl’, Nedelya, Novoe Vremya, a little later — Rus’). It views it as a verbalization of the national idea in its focus on the panhuman as a feasible ideal. The dispute that ensued around Dostoevsky’s speech led to the self-determination of the leading trends of Russian thought.","[('Vladimir Viktorovich', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University
10.1093/melus/mlz065,MELUS,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,The Context of Multi-Ethnic Politics for Ethiopian American Literature,[],"AbstractConsidering the broad conversation among African novelists about the representation of Africans in America, this essay proposes a reevaluation of Ethiopian American literature that is attentive to the historical complexity of Ethiopia’s ethnic diversity. Situating novels and memoirs in their regional context of the Horn of Africa, it highlights how writers of the Ethiopian diaspora sometimes wrestle with and other times avoid the implications of the region’s ethnic politics. Focusing on the novel The Parking Lot Attendant (2018) by Nafkote Tamirat as a case study, it compares it to how other novelists and memoirists from the region, including Dinaw Mengestu, Nega Mezlekia, Maaza Mengiste, Meti Birabiro, Rebecca Haile, and Nurrudin Farrah, have managed the burden of multi-ethnic representation. Tamirat’s novel is somewhat unique for framing the immigrant experience within the story of a political dystopia and uncanny “loneless” social relations. By analyzing Ethiopian American literature in this way, the essay critiques scholarship that has been inattentive to the complex multi-ethnic history of the region because of its focus on the alienation of Ethiopian protagonists from cross-cultural and intracultural forms of political engagement.","[('Steven W Thomas', 'Wagner College')]","['10.2307/467364', '10.2979/ral.2010.41.4.125', '10.2979/transition.113.52', '10.1080/13696815.2015.1112770', '10.1057/9781137378330', '10.2979/reseafrilite.46.4.107', '10.2979/reseafrilite.46.4.1', '10.2979/reseafrilite.49.1.02', '10.1080/09528829008576253', '10.1353/cal.0.0640', '10.3138/jcs.42.3.150', '10.3998/mpub.9724578', '10.1017/CBO9780511559273', '10.14321/j.ctv1fxmf1.12', '10.1353/saf.2017.0010', '10.2307/j.ctv136c203']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The data now available contribute to a more careful bibliographical description, which in turn leads to a correct chronological distribution of the copies and a more accurate reconstruction of their historical development. On the basis of the materiality of these precious incunabula, it is possible to delve deeper into questions that cover not only the dimension of the copy as an individual element, as a specific object or piece of a specific collection, but also, through these material features, it is possible to approach the model of the edition as the product of a cultural design or plan, animated by a specific intention and aimed at a specific public. This process of analysis, which goes from the copy to the edition, allows us to reconstruct the ideal copy of of this songbook and to shed light on its organisation and the aims of this editorial project, which is an important piece in the history of Castilian literature at the end of the 15th century.

OpenAI’s language-generation program GPT-3 illustrates the challenges of interpreting algorithmic-generated texts. This article advocates interpretive strategies that recognize the profound differences (in the case of GPT-3) of language that issues from a program that has a model only of language, not of the world. Conscious robots, when and if they emerge, will have profoundly different embodiments than humans. Fictions that imagine conscious robots thus face a similar challenge presented by the GPT-3 texts: will they gloss over the differences, or will they enact strategies that articulate the differences and explore their implications for humans immersed in algorithmic cultures? The author analyzes three contemporary novels that engage with this challenge: Annalee Newitz’s Autonomous (2017), Kuzuo Ishiguro’s Klara and the Sun (2021), and Ian McEwan’s Machines like Me (2019). Each interrogates how the human aura is subverted by conscious robots. The article concludes by proposing how a reconfigured human aura should be constituted.","[('N.

10.1093/alh/ajaa025,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"Reading the ""Memoirs of the Life of Florence Hall"" Through The Long Song of the Caribbean Colonial Archive",[],"AbstractThis article suggests that we should analyze the mediated and fragmentary narratives of the lives of the enslaved—the predominate format of such texts in the archives—as well as self-written slave narratives. Although not biographical in the same fashion as the self-written texts, these more ephemeral texts can also enhance and productively contribute to our understandings of the literary and discursive features of the era. In order to attend to such texts, we need to develop more dynamic reading strategies for the multiple voices and varied formats common to them. One such strategy is animated by arguments about alternative histories suggested by neo-slave-narrative novels like Andrea Levy’s The Long Song (2011). I suggest that drawing on the models of the imaginative possibilities of neo-slave-narrative fictions, along with conceptually related links to both Edward Said’s hermeneutics of contrapuntal reading and Saidiya Hartman’s exegetics of critical fabulation, reveals how an ephemeral and fragmentary text or “textual splinter” like “Memoirs of the Life of Florence Hall” may yield more complex readings and help us consider what the lives of the enslaved might have looked like, as well as offers portraits of the discursive networks in which it existed.The … archive was not meant to encode the nuances of Hall’s voice or memories of her experiences.

M. and A. G. Dostoevsky. Anna Grigoryevna has begun to actively participate in her husband’s creative process as a stenographer and copyist since 1866, and in the publishing business — since 1873. The publishing business of the Dostoevsky family is considered in the article against the background of the publishing process of the 19th century, which consisted of the author’s prepress work on the text together with the editor, publisher, typographer, printing factor, metranpage, proofreader, censor. Anna Grigorievna worked on the proofs along with Dostoevsky. After the publication of the book or a magazine issue, the book trade began, which described in the memoirs of A. G. Dostoevskaya, her letters and notebooks, which contained systematic records related to the distribution of “A Writer’s Diary” and the sale of books. The names of publishers, booksellers and subscribers are regularly mentioned in F. M. Dostoevsky’s notebook of 1875–1876, as well as in A. G. Dostoevskaya’s notebooks of 1875–1884. However, there is no proper commentary in the scientific literature on many names, or, if present, it is not entirely accurate. The author of the article, in particular, found out which of the five Pechatkin brothers is mentioned in the notebooks of F. M.

The first epoch was when the oral text was written down. The second was when the German scribe Guttenberg invented the printing press, and the handwritten text became printed. Now text is becoming digital, and there is a natural digitalization of all spheres of human activity, including the legacy of Dostoevsky. Modern information technologies create a new type of text that not only preserves the advantages of oral, handwritten and printed text, but also acquires new capabilities. The digital text expands the range of sources, the volume of information, and stimulates new methods of studying the writer's creative work. Despite the fact that electronic libraries, which currently dominate the Internet, present digital copies of Dostoevsky's printed publications, new types of electronic publications and new tools for analyzing not only handwritten and printed, but also digital text, are emerging. The idea of Digital Dostoevsky is being implemented in Petrozavodsk University projects (since 1995), the Institute of Russian Literature of the Russian Academy of Sciences (since 2016), and the University of Toronto (since 2019). Lexicographic work on Dostoevsky's vocabulary is being carried out in digital format at the Russian Language Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The article provides an overview and outlines the prospects for the development of Digital Dostoevsky.

We use the concept of authoritarian learning to develop this demand-side perspective (Hall and Ambrosio, 2017).

Such forms contrast with those ordinarily attested in Occitan, where preterite desinences are typically characterised by a thematic rhotic (e.g. cantèri [kanˈtɛɾi] ‘sing.prt.1sg’), while thematic labials are associated solely with first-conjugation imperfect desinences (e.g. cantavi [kanˈtaβi] ‘sing.ipf.ind.1sg’). This study draws on data from textual sources and linguistic atlases in order to elucidate the development of the Toulousain labial preterites, which are shown to emerge during the course of the eighteenth century, replacing earlier forms in which preterite desinences systematically presented a thematic velar (e.g. cantègui [kanˈtɛɣi] ‘sing.prt.1sg’). Since both intervocalic /b/ and /ɡ/ are subject to deletion in Toulousain varieties, it is argued that the development of the labial preterites is not due to direct analogy from the imperfect indicative, but rather to a perception-based change in which speakers miscategorised tokens of /ɡ/ tending to zero as tokens of /b/, and thereby introduced thematic labials into preterite forms. Forms lacking a thematic consonant result directly from deletion of /ɡ/.","[('Louise Esher', 'CNRS (LLACAN, UMR 8135) , 7 rue Guy Môquet – BP 8 , Villejuif , France')]",[],Walter de Gruyter GmbH

Research examining malign information influence is growing, but more attention could be given to its psychological effects. Information operations are commonly assumed to affect the levels of trust and the emotional experiences of citizens who are targeted by them, but these notions are currently supported by limited evidence. We propose that experimental psychological research is a promising avenue to more clearly demonstrate these effects and individual differences of the target audience that may exacerbate these effects. This article discusses the knowledge gap regarding the psychological effects of malign information influence and suggests relevant psychological research that can be built upon when devising experimental studies that might address it. Finally, the article outlines key benefits that insights gleaned from this experimental research would offer to those seeking to counter malign information influence.","[('Aiden Hoyle', 'University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands; TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research), The Netherlands; Netherlands Defense Academy, The Netherlands'), ('Helma van den Berg', 'TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research), The Netherlands'), ('Bertjan Doosje', 'University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands'), ('Martijn Kitzen', 'Netherlands Defense Academy, The Netherlands')]","['10.1057/9780230592100_14', '10.1080/14702436.2019.1597631', '10.1080/09592318.2016.1151653', '10.1007/s12144-003-1011-9', '10.1145/3274289', '10.1073/pnas.1906420116', '10.1016/j.chb.2019.07.026', '10.2478/jobs-2018-0008', '10.1080/09592310802462273', '10.1057/ap.2012.27', '10.1080/1057610X.2015.1116277', '10.1177/2336825X20935244', '10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.752', '10.1007/978-3-030-04621-7_4', '10.1080/14702436.2016.1256209', '10.30966/2018.RIGA.8.3.', '10.1177/1750635220965622', '10.1080/09557571.2020.1719038', '10.1080/13183222.2018.1418819', '10.1080/13216597.2020.1817122', '10.1007/978-94-6265-189-0_9', '10.1177/0146167205284282', '10.1080/01296612.2017.1384145', '10.3758/MC.38.8.1087', '10.7249/RR2779', '10.1080/05679320600661640', '10.1007/s11109-012-9216-y', '10.1093/ijpor/edaa004', '10.1177/0093650216644026', '10.1080/10584609.2020.1723754', '10.7249/RRA704-3', '10.1080/03071847.2020.1727156', '10.1111/bjop.12018', '10.1111/bjop.12385', '10.1111/bjso.12394', '10.1080/17512786.2016.1163237', '10.1177/1940161218786426', '10.7249/RR1498', '10.1057/s41311-020-00215-x', '10.1111/1468-2346.12509', '10.1017/eis.2019.6', '10.1177/1077699015596338', '10.1016/j.jarmac.2017.07.008', '10.1177/1529100612451018', '10.1037/a0034515', '10.1177/0093650215577859', '10.4324/9781315871264', '10.1080/1369118X.2019.1646778', '10.1163/1871191X-11411019', '10.1080/1060586X.2016.1146452', '10.1007/978-94-6265-222-4_14', '10.1037/xge0000465', '10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60214-2', '10.1177/009365097024005002', '10.1111/spsr.12261', '10.1080/23800992.2019.1695666', '10.17645/pag.v5i4.1124', '10.1177/1750635213516696', '10.1080/09546553.2020.1803288', '10.1177/0539018417734419', '10.1080/1369183X.2014.981513', '10.1080/10584609.2017.1316807', '10.1080/10584609.2020.1736700', '10.1177/1077699013514414', '10.1145/3359229', '10.1177/0192512113492599', '10.1111/pops.12513', '10.1126/science.aap9559', '10.1080/09662839.2020.1771695', '10.1177/1750635219884343', '10.1080/1553118X.2019.1630413', '10.1111/jcom.12164', '10.1145/3274452', '10.1037/pac0000126', '10.11610/Connections.15.2.06', '10.1080/14702436.2020.1718498', '10.1111/1467-9256.12097']",SAGE Publications
10.1093/alh/ajaa010,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Good Vibrations,[],"Abstract In recent years, the writings of the Frankfurt School have become heavily “sociologized” in form as well as content and no longer register on the radar of literary scholars. Hartmut Rosa’s Resonance (2019) may well reverse this trend. Ranging widely across literature, aesthetics and popular culture as well as sociology and politics, Rosa contends that the idea of resonance can help renew critical theory. Confronting a question that is also exercising literary scholars—Is it possible to orient away from negativity and skepticism without lapsing into dubious universalism or naïve affirmation?—his account of resonance hooks up in suggestive ways with recent literary-critical discussions of attunement, mood, and atmosphere. Rosa’s argument pivots on a contrast between two forms of relation: the world as resonance and the world as resource (material to be exploited in the maximization of profit and the frenetic acceleration of social life). In contrast to the acute pessimism of the early Frankfurt School, however, he stresses the double-sidedness of modernity; rather than simply destroying resonance, modern societies can also heighten or even create new capacities for experiencing resonance.","[('Rita Felski', '')]","['10.1093/alh/ajz023', '10.2307/463483', '10.1215/15314200-7615536', '10.1215/23289252-2815111', '10.7208/chicago/9780226729770.001.0001', '10.1525/rep.2017.140.1.137', '10.7312/honn16246', '10.4159/9780674988712', '10.7551/mitpress/2222.001.0001', '10.7312/rosa14834', '10.1215/10418385-4383010']",Oxford University Press (OUP)
10.1093/alh/ajaa032,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Genealogies of Black Modernities,[],"Abstract This essay introduces the major themes and concerns of “Genealogies of Black Modernity in the Long Nineteenth Century,” a special issue of American Literary History. How does modernity look when read through Black diasporic literary production in the long nineteenth century, broadly conceived? What new narratives can we create by reading this literature as participating in and producing transatlantic genealogies of literary modernity? How does reading Black literary modernity in the nineteenth century disrupt our understandings of modernity as a conceptual framework both for contemporary scholarship and as an object of nineteenth-century Black intellectual inquiry? This introductory essay defines Black modernities of the long nineteenth century as a set of related, sometimes connected, practices and questions focused on the nature of Black life and culture in an ever-shifting antiblack world. Writers from Phillis Wheatley to Pauline Hopkins—to offer one framing—were invested in chronicling and intervening in the newness of their moment, even as they worked to imagine new possibilities for the future. Our task, then, was to deliberate over what something called modernity meant and means for and in African American literary history through the archive of Black writing and through the terms and forms these writers set forth.","[('Derrick R Spires', '')]","['10.1093/alh/ajaa025', '10.7208/chicago/9780226156293.001.0001', '10.1093/alh/ajaa023', '10.1093/alh/ajaa029', '10.1002/9781444323474.ch3', '10.1002/9781444323474.ch7', '10.1093/alh/ajaa028', '10.1093/alh/ajaa033', '10.1093/alh/ajaa024']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

In contrast with the liberal hegemony and, more specifically, with its ‘true European values’, right-wing populists in Poland claim to speak in the name of those people who refuse this external system of values and who experienced a ‘cultural displacement’. The article examines whether the consensual process of European Union (EU) integration has created room for a populist moment. Particular emphasis is given to the importance of culture in the construction of an alternative neo-traditionalist project. While the post-structuralist literature on populism has mostly focused on Western Europe and socio-economic demands, the concept of neo-traditionalism reveals the confrontation between two different blocs also in Central-Eastern Europe. The author analyses the neo-traditionalist discourse in Poland, most notably produced by the conservative party Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS), as a counter-hegemonic project. Opposing mainstream EU values, PiS appealed to ‘ordinary Poles’ and adopted a traditionalist-conservative narrative. The article will show how the neglect of a neo-traditionalist world view by the European elite and the threat to identity posed by liberal and individualistic values have been exploited by right-wing populists to forge a new common sense.","[('Francesco Melito', 'Jagiellonian University, Poland')]","['10.7829/j.ctv280b73c', '10.1111/1467-9248.00184', '10.3726/978-1-4331-3754-9', '10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083', '10.1080/13501760110098323', '10.1177/0888325402239684', '10.1177/019685998601000202', '10.1177/0888325402239689', '10.1111/j.1475-6765.1992.tb00303.x', '10.1111/1467-8675.12308', '10.1017/S0260210519000299', '10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001', '10.1177/0888325402239682', '10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x', '10.1017/gov.2012.11', '10.9783/9780812293784', '10.1007/978-3-319-94123-3_4', '10.17645/pag.v5i4.1123', '10.1353/jod.2007.a223242', '10.1177/0888325406297131', '10.1177/030981680709300110', '10.1080/01436597.2012.666016', '10.1111/1467-8675.12127', '10.1080/17405904.2017.1309325', '10.1080/13523270903310837', '10.1057/9781137414113', '10.4135/9781446270073', '10.1080/09537320220148085', '10.1215/9780822381822']",SAGE Publications

They include letters, diaries and memoirs of listeners, telegrams and reports in newspapers and journals of the time. A cross-examination of existing and newly discovered sources revealed a number of conjectures, which usually emerge due to ideological considerations. The focus is on the memoirs of E. P. Letkova-Sultanova and D. N. Lyubimov, which depicted the event from ideologically opposed points of view. Thus, Letkova strongly denies the moment of unanimity of Dostoevsky's audience, recorded by other memoirists, and insists on the initial rejection of his speech by radical youth. Her memoirs usually arouse the confidence of researchers, since the author confirms his judgments with excerpts from his personal diary regarding the two-day the Pushkin celebration (June 7 and 8) that assert the priority of Turgenev. Letkova's memoirs were published in 1932. However, another, earlier and previously unpublished text has been preserved in The Russian State Archive of Literature and Arts in the N. S. Ashukin collection. It comprises five handwritten pages of the article “June days of 1880 in Moscow (From the diary of Ekaterina Letkova)”. Comparison of the early (1924) and late (1932) editions of Letkova's “diary” leads to the unequivocal conclusion that this “diary” was a later mystification, which was supposed to confirm the righteousness of progressive forces in their opposition to Dostoevsky (this motive was significantly emphasized in the 1932 edition). The memoirs of D. N. Lyubimov are structured in the same manner, only differing in that they covered the event from a conservative point of view. Lyubimov's memoirs are relevant for researchers, since he described Dostoevsky's audience in a more detailed way than other memoirists. This description should have led to the idea of consolidating the best members of Russian society. However, a critical analysis of this source showed that more than half of those who listened to Dostoevsky according to Lyubimov could not have attended the meeting. The memoirist also distorts the Turgenev's perception of Dostoevsky's speech (he allegedly “sobbed” when the speaker compared Lisa Kalitina to Tatyana Larina). Criticism of sources allows us to clarify a number of aspects in the perception of Dostoevsky's Pushkin speech as a key event in Russian culture, to approach its understanding on the basis of verified evidence from contemporaries.","[('Vladimir Viktorovich', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University

While this usually applies to systems whose survival is seen in a positive light (such as democracy), this article emphasizes the other, darker side of this phenomenon. I demonstrate how anti-corruption discourse can support certain practices that actually contribute to the resilience of corruption. By comparing the anti-corruption discourses of the Russian government and its political opposition, this article shows the interdependence and mutual reinforcement of two practices: (I) the pervasive resolution of everyday problems by corrupt methods and (II) focusing on the corruption of particular actors as the main obstacle to the development of the country and society. The effect of this interdependence is ambivalent, as both practices challenge corruption and contribute to its resilience. In effect, this becomes a mode of government and I link the concept of resilience with the literature on governmentality to better illuminate the endurance of corruption in Russia despite sincere (and even well-intended) anti-corruption campaigns. This model of rethinking the resilience of corrupt practices with the special focus on anti-corruption rhetoric can be applied to other countries where corruption serves as a pivot of the social and economic system, as it does in Russia.","[('Elena Pavlova', 'St. Petersburg State University and University of Tartu, Estonia')]","['10.1080/09668136.2019.1577359', '10.1111/1467-9256.12079', '10.1111/gove.12232', '10.1111/1467-9256.12032', '10.1177/0967010614555943', '10.4324/9781315773810', '10.1177/2041905818764704', '10.1177/0967010614557884', '10.1007/s12116-014-9155-1', '10.1080/09668136.2014.1001577', '10.1146/annurev.es.04.110173.000245', '10.1111/1467-9256.12080', '10.1080/21693293.2013.765741', '10.1080/10758216.2002.11655993', '10.1080/13510347.2015.1071797', '10.1111/ehr.12666', '10.1080/09692291003791448', '10.1080/10758216.2017.1363655', '10.1080/09668136.2015.1120276', '10.5699/slaveasteurorev2.95.1.0001', '10.1080/1060586X.2014.931683', '10.1215/08992363-13-2-191', '10.1016/S0176-2680(02)00078-2', '10.1080/15705854.2014.965899', '10.1111/gove.12172', '10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01604.x', '10.2753/PPC1075-8216600202', '10.1111/1467-9256.12033', '10.1017/CBO9781139175098', '10.1007/s10611-013-9506-2', '10.1080/03906700500038678', '10.2139/ssrn.3143406', '10.1016/S0047-2727(99)00092-4', '10.1080/21599165.2014.990628', '10.1596/978-0-8213-9475-5']",SAGE Publications

It suggests that, in limited ways, alternatives are possible. The alternatives are limited because our responsibilities as teachers more or less automatically commit us to propping up the ruling class. They are possible because the conditions of academic writing still leave room for a distinction between the best that is known or thought and what someone is prepared to pay for.

While naturalism has been noted in McCarthy's work prior to these novels, this article contends that the character and strength of naturalism has changed in the most recent works. This change is placed in the general context of naturalist theory, as well as what the article argues is a more general resurgence of naturalism in American culture post-9/11. In particular, this article examines the implications in McCarthy's work for the extent to which the deterministic dimension of naturalism prevents us from judging characters morally, since they exercise at best highly limited free will.

While scholarship has emphasized confession as a powerful means of witnessing male misbehavior, the #MeToo era urges readers to question who or what, beyond mere representation, confession serves. I suggest that protagonist Yunior’s compulsive confessions of lying, cheating and womanizing in This is How You Lose Her (2012) expose how his sense of self is split between an authoritarian Dominican past and an oppressive US present. Yunior’s macho behavior conjures the historical specter of Dominican strongman dictator, Trujillo, while his confessions make readers complicit in his immorality, echoing Trujillo’s manipulation of information for control. Forging this uneasy textual intimacy between reader and narrator further underscores mainstream expectations, in the US present, that minority writers “confess” their intimate lives for entertainment, conscribing how and what they express. Yet Yunior’s narrative also conscribes female representation by centering—and then absolving—male misbehavior through a confession that looks like a dialogue (addressing “you”) but in fact functions as a monologue. I also interrogate Díaz’s authorial interviews and apply Lili Loofbourow’s idea of the “male self-pardon” to Díaz’s autobiographical essay “The Silence: The Legacy of Childhood Trauma” (2018), in which he reveals surviving childhood sexual assault and confesses that he subsequently “hurt” intimate female partners. I argue that confession—whether Yunior’s or Díaz’s—perpetuates a masculine monologue that marginalizes women’s voices. Masculine confessions reach for intimacy but fail when they cannot imagine women as fully as men.","[('Ruth McHugh-Dillon', 'Monash University, Australia')]","['10.1353/rmc.2009.0008', '10.1353/lit.2017.0014', '10.1215/9780822390282', '10.3828/bhs.2013.30', '10.4159/9780674029538', '10.2979/jmodelite.41.2.08', '10.1057/9780230605169', '10.1215/9780822390862', '10.1353/cal.2000.0131', '10.2307/j.ctt19705td', '10.1093/melus/mlu032', '10.1353/cal.0.0661', '10.5744/florida/9780813049304.001.0001', '10.5406/illinois/9780252039911.001.0001', '10.2307/j.ctt20mvc76', '10.1353/cli.2011.0029', '10.1080/13569325.2010.494928', '10.5040/9798216028574.ch-016', '10.1093/melus/mlx046', '10.1057/9780230100800', '10.1093/melus/32.1.75', '10.1075/chlel.x.06tor', '10.3149/jms.2202.89']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

This is perceived by comparing the intentions declared in the forewords by the Catholic compilers and their antagonists. In terms of criteria that were not alien to Catholic reformers, but that are intensified as a reaction to Lutheran criticism, post-Tridentine Catholic hagiographers repudiate not only the false, but also the doubtful and the written by unknown authors, thus distancing themselves from the medieval permissiveness with the last two categories. In addition, the mockery of hagiographic falsehoods becomes a weapon for Lutherans and a threat that must be prevented for Catholics. By attending to these approaches it is found that the Italian Lippomano and the German Surius, beyond being the source of the material for Villegas and Ribadeneira, the main post-Tridentine Castilian hagiographers, provide them also with methodological guidelines and criteria of orthodoxy.","[('Fernando Baños-Vallejo', '')]",[],Universidad de Navarra

Such references are used as a coherent discursive strategy to construct social actors following the PRR ideological core of nativism, authoritarianism, and populism. As the PRR identifies itself with the people, defined along nativist and populist lines, rights are always attributed to it. The PRR represents itself as the defender of the people and its rights, while the elites and the aliens are predicated to threaten the people and its rights. References to rights in PRR discourses intrinsically link the individual with the collective, which allows to construct and promote a populist model of ethnic democracy.","[('Alexander Alekseev', 'National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russian Federation; Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation')]","['10.1075/jlp.18013.may', '10.1080/13569310500244354', '10.1080/0031322X.2015.1023655', '10.4324/9781315687988', '10.1057/9780230592100_1', '10.1007/978-1-349-23547-6', '10.1057/9781403920072_11', '10.5040/9781472544940.ch-005', '10.1086/286904', '10.1057/9781403920072_2', '10.4324/9780203466247', '10.1007/978-1-137-04122-7', '10.1111/j.1467-9760.1994.tb00019.x', '10.4324/9781315730578-9', '10.1080/15562948.2017.1317897', '10.1080/10350330.2020.1766199', '10.5040/9781472544940.ch-003', '10.1057/fp.2015.18', '10.1057/9781403920072', '10.1057/978-1-137-56332-3', '10.7228/manchester/9780719057939.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9780511492037', '10.1353/jod.2019.0066', '10.1057/9781403920072_9', '10.1017/9781108751551', '10.4324/9780203856567', '10.1093/oso/9780198837886.001.0001', '10.1080/714005438', '10.4324/9781315144993-8', '10.1111/j.1475-6765.1980.tb00737.x', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198803560.001.0001', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198803560.001.0001', '10.1111/j.1475-6765.2005.00233.x', '10.1017/S1755773910000068', '10.1080/13600826.2018.1546673', '10.1007/978-3-319-43533-6_9', '10.1080/13569310701822289', '10.3406/xxs.1997.4489', '10.1057/9781403920072_7', '10.1057/9781137414113', '10.1177/1461445699001001005', '10.1163/9789004416017', '10.1007/978-3-030-17997-7_17', '10.4135/9780857028020.n4', '10.4135/9780857028020.n1', '10.1007/978-1-137-04798-4_1', '10.4135/9781529739664', '10.1016/j.dcm.2018.07.005', '10.1080/13569310802377019']",SAGE Publications

Literary Strategies of using the Present Tense (using the example of Wilhalm von Wenden by Ulrichs von Etzenbach),[],"Abstract What are the narrative functions of the present tense in medieval narrations? In order to address this question, the paper brings together linguistic observations on tense semantics and a literary analysis of ›Wilhalm von Wenden‹ by Ulrich von Etzenbach. It shows that the present tense can refer to three different kinds of ›now‹, i. e. the ›discourse now‹, the ›story now‹, and the ›recipient’s now‹. In all three contexts, the present tense is not used as a narrative tense but rather indicates a speaker’s voice commenting on the events. This leads to the hypothesis that the development of the ›narrative present‹ (as common in modern novels) is based on two requirements: The decoupling between the ›discourse now‹ and the diegetic world as well as the decoupling between the author and the fictional instance of the narrator.","[('Katharina Philipowski', 'Universität Potsdam Institut für Germanistik Am Neuen Palais 10, 14469 Potsdam Deutschland'), ('Sonja Zeman', 'LMU München Institut für Deutsche Philologie Schellingstraße 3/RG, 80799 München Deutschland')]",[],Walter de Gruyter GmbH

This article analyses the Winnetou film trilogy in dialogue with Karl May's original 1893 novels and the 1960s West German westerns using the concepts of settler time and white innocence. It brings a critical focus on race that is lacking in much existing scholarship on May, showing how whiteness functions in the Winnetou franchise as a structuring principle. In the new Winnetou, the blood brotherhood between the white German Old Shatterhand and the Mescalero Apache Winnetou becomes a way of forging connections not only across cultures but across temporal lines, allowing for the imposition of settler time onto Indigenous persons and the erasure of Indigenous sovereignty and survival in order to centre a narrative of German innocence and reinscribe fantasies of white conquest in the American West.","[('Maureen O.

Using only a satiric essay in the North American Review, “A Defense of General Funston,” and a letter to the editor of the Denver Post, near where Funston was then stationed, Mark Twain generated a controversy that lasted for months, was covered by many newspapers throughout the continental United States, and succeeded in destroying Funston's reputation. This relatively minor episode in Twain's life reveals not only how he was able to leverage his celebrity and manipulate the US mass media during the final decade of his life, but also how the mass media environment, which had continually expanded and diversified over the course of the nineteenth century, had become a site of cultural power.","[('Matt Seybold', 'Elmira College')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

10.1093/melus/mlaa015,MELUS,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Toward an Infrastructural Sublime: Narrating Interdependency in Karen Tei Yamashita's Los Angeles,[],"AbstractThis article examines the vibrant city infrastructures of Karen Tei Yamashita's 1997 novel Tropic of Orange in order to highlight interdependency as political and aesthetic value. The novel's emphasis on urban support systems—the oft-unnoticed roads, pipes, wires, and labor networks that allow the city to function—positions infrastructure as itself a critical lens, one that can reassess the relationship of ethnic American literature and subjectivity to the values of self-ownership, protest, and independence. By amplifying the overlooked support networks that underpin fictions of self-sufficiency, Yamashita's Tropic of Orange diverges from the narrative of self-ownership as liberatory endpoint. Instead, it recuperates the much-maligned category of dependency, positioning dependency as a vital site of aesthetic and political possibility within anti-racist and anti-capitalist struggle. This recuperation proves particularly significant in light of pernicious and persistent dependency mythologies, such as the “illegal immigrant,” that frame racialized subjects as drains on the public. Infrastructure, as an often unseen entity nonetheless central to the operation of cities and the global distribution of resources, represents a key vehicle in Tropic of Orange for thinking about contemporary ecologies of assistance, power, and provision, and for mapping the global imbalances of power that render certain dependencies hypervisible while erasing others.","[('Jina B Kim', 'Smith College')]","['10.1215/9780822391623', '10.1086/449030', '10.1093/alh/ajs074', '10.1215/9780822373520', '10.2979/NWS.2002.14.3.1', '10.5749/j.ctttvbtk', '10.4324/9780203852897', '10.1080/13528165.2011.578722', '10.1093/melus/mlx047', '10.1146/annurev-anthro-092412-155522', '10.1353/mfs.2007.0049', '10.1353/mfs.2015.0051', '10.4324/9781315171142-5', '10.1215/9780822379010', '10.4324/9780203830802', '10.1215/9780822394075-004', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816674244.001.0001', '10.5749/j.ctttss1w', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195377361.001.0001', '10.1353/mfs.2015.0049', '10.1215/08992363-16-3-407', '10.1632/pmla.2007.122.1.9']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The French Press and the Invention of Pornography,[],"AbstractThis essay explores the sudden popularity and redefinition of the word pornographie in France in the 1880s. Following the publication of Émile Zola’s novel Nana and the rise of a genre of cheap, bawdy newspapers in 1880, the French daily press knowingly “invented” the word pornographie to designate these sexually explicit publications. Reviving an esoteric word, the press redeployed it with a new meaning and a (concocted) origin narrative that highlighted both the word’s “newness” and Zola’s place in the “new” genre it designated. This reinvention and deployment of the word were driven by the evolving politics and economics of the daily press during the first decades of the Third Republic. Ultimately, this politically motivated, half-fabricated reinvention of the word pornographie culminated with its becoming the catchall term that would all but replace obscenity as a signifier of sexually charged representation in the twentieth century.","[('Raisa Rexer', 'Vanderbilt University')]","['10.1525/9780520923485', '10.2307/j.ctv14gpj76.4', '10.1525/9780520924208', '10.2307/778313', '10.1525/9780520916777-008']",Duke University Press

Teniendo que prescindir, por tanto, de las fuentes históricas que podemos considerar más fiables para poder trazar un perfil aproximado de Gracia Dei, debemos acudir a otros documentos, así como establecer conjeturas a partir de las pocas noticias que el propio autor plasmó en su producción literaria.

We are dealing with a leading figure who, although he was linked to the Catholic Monarchs’s environment, the great chronicles that were made about this reign by writers also tied to the court do not reveal any information about him. We must therefore dispense with the historical sources that we may consider more reliable to be able to draw an approximate profile of Gracia Dei, and we must turn to other documents, as well as establish conjectures from the few news that the author himself captured in his literary production. The rubrics of his works that were copied during the 16th, 17th and even 18th centuries will also be of great interest in this regard, although they are characterized by having generated even more controversy about the possible positions that Gracia Dei would perform throughout his life.","[('Natalia Anaís Mangas Navarro', '')]",[],Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia

M. Dostoevsky’s novel “Demons”, specifically, the pages containing the scene of Karmazinov reading his work “Merci”. The draft manuscript of the novel “Demons” is a syntactically coherent text containing a large number of author’s edits between the lines and in the margins. The analysis of the manuscript made it possible to identify inaccuracies in its reading by publishers that negatively affect the interpretation of the text. In addition, this analysis helped to correct these errors and accompany them with the necessary textual commentary, affecting, in particular, such problems as the establishment of the text, the identification and analysis of new discrepancies (variants) between the sources of the text, as well as text omissions in print. The textual part of the work is continued by the historical-literary and real commentary proposed in the article based on the newly discovered information about the features of the creation of the artistic concept of “Demons,” explaining the significance of literary and historical motifs that are associated with ancient culture and history for the novel plot. In the process of analyzing handwritten and printed sources, literary and historical allusions were established, which the specified episode of the novel “Demons” contains. In addition, the article examined the historical subtext and symbolism of ancient motifs that were reflected in the scene of literary reading in “Demons,” as well as the content of some historical sources (works by ancient authors on the history of Ancient Rome; lectures by T. N. Granovsky, who became the prototype of the hero of the novel, Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky). New information revealed during the study of the draft manuscript of “Demons” indicates, on the one hand, that the ancient “trace” played an important role in the development of the idea of this novel, on the other hand, the complexity of the novel’s narrative structure.","[('Natalia Tarasova', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University

Their similarity is not explained in any way. According to the author, this is “a completely inexplicable incident,” however, critics keep trying to explain the appearance of the double. The range of interpretations is extensive — from the rationalistic and empirical rejection of fantastika to numerous psychopathological, ethical, social and other concepts of it. They have the same status: they are all nontextual readings of the work. Critics do not read Dostoevsky, rather, they compose their own version of The Double. It all started with Belinsky, who made factual errors in the analysis of The Double. Dobrolyubov frankly admitted that his explanation of the double was formed “while thumbing through” the story. All subsequent interpretations are variations of their explanations of fantastika. Dostoevsky was sensitive to the misunderstanding of readers and critics. In 1862 and 1864, he created drafts with the aim of revising The Double. Unable to carry out this plan, in September 1866 Dostoevsky cut down the magazine’s editorial staff and made other changes that polemically opposed the interpretations of Belinsky and Dobrolyubov. The analysis of the two editions of The Double and the materials in the 1862-1864 notebooks (Russian State Library. F. 93.I.2.6 and 93.I.2.7) demonstrate that Dostoevsky did not think of The Double as a ghost, hallucination, or the delirium of a madman, but, rather, considered him a real character in the story. Denying the similarity and protesting against the immorality of the younger Golyadkin, the elder proclaims: man is unique. This idea was a development of the anthropological principle that Dostoevsky discovered in Poor Folk and later vividly expressed in Notes from the Underground.","[('Vladimir Zakharov', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University

A key example is Haitian author Louis-Philippe Dalembert’s novel Avant que les ombres s’effacent (2017), which tracks the traumatic dispersion of a Polish Jewish family to Haiti, Cuba, Israel, and the US in the late 1930s. Dalembert interweaves the tale of his Jewish protagonist’s flight to Haiti with portrayals of the Haitian émigré community in Paris and the Haitian concentration camp prisoner Jean-Marcel Nicolas. Blending fact and fiction, the novel highlights the Haitian state’s little-known efforts to aid Holocaust refugees and connects those efforts to the island nation’s own revolutionary history. In this article, I argue that fiction’s unique traits as a medium of cultural memory enable Dalembert to reframe the wartime past from a Haitian perspective. Avant que les ombres s’effacent harnesses the fictional privileges of literary narrative, mediating between the real and the imaginary and combining Jewish and Caribbean memory systems in unexpected and often startling ways. Generating images of the wartime past that transform our perception of it, the novel moves Haiti to the center of the story and in so doing uncovers global dimensions of Jewish experience.","[('Sarah Phillips Casteel', 'professor of English at Carleton University')]","['10.7312/cast17440', '10.1353/jhs.2018.0011', '10.1057/9780230321670', '10.1017/9781787441750', '10.2307/j.ctv2867j9', '10.5703/shofar.37.1.0041', '10.4000/etudesafricaines.25249', '10.1353/frf.2019.0011']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Special attention is paid to the period of the release of the Complete Works of F. M. Dostoevsky.

Vargunina,” and negotiations with the Panteleev brothers printing house about the appearance of the book, the cost of publication, typing, proofreading, printing and booklets. The next stage was connected with the release of the book from the printing house until the time of its sale: first of all, the issue of storing a huge number of books (several tens of thousands) was solved; Anna Grigoryevna rented storerooms and developed accounting systems for this purpose. After the publication was released from the printing house, it was necessary to check the books for flaws; it was also important to notify readers through ads and booksellers about the appearance of a new edition. The final stage of the publishing process was connected with the sale of editions of the Complete works of Dostoevsky: correspondence with buyers and booksellers, forwarding of works, transfer of books on commission and endless accounting and recording of all volumes — all this required a lot of effort and time and had its own specifics, and if you did not know precisely what to do, you could face a significant loss. At each stage of the publishing process, unforeseen difficulties arose caused by the inexperience of the first Russian individual publisher, the negligence of the persons with whom she had to deal, or a combination of circumstances. It describes not only the problems that Dostoevskaya had to face, but also the ways to solve them, requiring the publisher to be reasonable and firm in spirit.

Their investments in examining the political stakes of solidarity—in the Oceti Sakowin’s resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline Project, in Afrofuturist and Indigenous speculative fiction that traces the boundary between Black and Indigenous political formations, and in the tensions that exist among American Indian writing from the interwar and pre-civil rights era—help us to understand how Indigenous solidarity is connected to complex histories, settler-colonial relations, and systemic inequalities, as well as the political promise that social justice movements create.","[('Cheryl Suzack', '')]","['10.5749/jcritethnstud.5.1-2.0207', '10.2307/1409161', '10.2307/1229039', '10.1111/cag.12260', '10.5749/j.ctvr695pq', '10.1080/13200968.2009.10854413', '10.5749/jcritethnstud.5.1-2.0215', '10.5749/jcritethnstud.1.1.0076', '10.22329/wyaj.v30i1.4358', '10.1215/9780822376781-004', '10.2307/464747', '10.1086/448328', '10.1080/14623520601056240']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

This status is a consequence of the occupational concentration of Asian immigrants into professional-managerial careers, especially in scientific and technical fields: a phenomenon that can be traced back to the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. Reading Maxine Hong Kingston’s Woman Warrior (1976) along with the debut works of recent Chinese American women writers, including Ling Ma’s Severance (2018), this article describes a dialectic of science fictionality and post-65 Asian American literature in which the latter develops autopoetic tendencies that register occupational concentration in genre, theme, characterization, and trope. This reorientation of post-65 Asian American literary history to the material conditions of science fictionality, rather than ethnic self-expression, has implications not only for understanding that history but also for generalized periodizations of contemporary US literature like the “genre turn,” which risk eliding the specificity of minority literary histories.","[('Christopher T Fan', '')]","['10.1093/oso/9780195134032.001.0001', '10.7591/9781501721120', '10.1057/9780230117327', '10.5040/9798400683824', '10.1215/9780822383512', '10.2307/467101', '10.1093/alh/ajt006', '10.2307/j.ctv6wgc3b', '10.1215/00267929-1631460', '10.7312/mart18192', '10.1215/0041462X-2007-4006', '10.2307/j.ctvjsf59f', '10.1080/01419870.2014.941891', '10.1215/9780822378945', '10.1515/9781400821068']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

This article considers whether the concept of bureaucratic-authoritarianism is really applicable in the case of Russia. Lilia Shevtsova was the first to tentatively state that Russia is a case of bureaucratic-authoritarianism. However, to provide more assured acceptance or rejection of the concept, this article returns to the paradigm’s roots. The concept of bureaucratic-authoritarianism was developed by Guillermo O’Donnell and thus the characteristics he outlined are applied to the case of Russia in the Putin era. Doing so allows for a level of precision and depth in concluding that bureaucratic-authoritarianism is a relevant paradigm. Confirmatory evidence for all seven of the characteristics enumerated by O’Donnell is found, suggesting that Russia in the Putin era can be considered a case of bureaucratic-authoritarianism.","[('Judas Everett', 'National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moskva, Russia')]","['10.2307/3338863', '10.2747/1060-586X.19.3.189', '10.1177/0267323104042908', '10.1086/589656', '10.2753/PPC1075-8216600301', '10.2307/2010193', '10.1353/wp.1997.0009', '10.1353/jod.2015.0031', '10.1353/jod.2020.0044', '10.4324/9781315685175-4', '10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2017.09.005', '10.2307/j.ctt155jmv1', '10.2747/1060-586X.21.3.226', '10.4324/9781315568423', '10.1080/09668136.2015.1113232', '10.3200/DEMO.14.4.613-626', '10.1017/CBO9781316417720', '10.1080/09668130500126361', '10.1353/jod.1991.0016', '10.1016/j.postcomstud.2010.10.004', '10.2307/2010441', '10.1017/CBO9781139175173', '10.4324/9781003099161', '10.1017/S0043887100009369', '10.1016/j.esr.2020.100511', '10.1016/S0176-2680(99)00050-6', '10.3366/edinburgh/9781474454766.001.0001', '10.1177/108118001129172260', '10.1007/BF02687627', '10.1080/03066150.2018.1561439', '10.1017/S0037677900019707', '10.5129/001041518822704926', '10.1080/1060586X.1996.10641428', '10.1017/CBO9780511510281', '10.1353/jod.2017.0075', '10.1080/03932729808456825', '10.1177/0094582X8501200403', '10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.013.413', '10.1007/s10888-018-9383-0', '10.1017/S0023879100030661', '10.1525/9780520336582', '10.1016/j.postcomstud.2017.05.005', '10.1080/1060586X.2013.825140', '10.2307/165718', '10.1017/S0023879100033628', '10.1017/9781316761649', '10.1111/blar.12519', '10.1163/2451-8921-00302001', '10.1080/09668136.2011.557526', '10.1057/s41599-018-0137-1', '10.1162/016366003322596927', '10.1525/curh.1998.97.621.313', '10.1080/13523279.2011.636034', '10.4324/9781315781037', '10.1353/jod.2001.0082', '10.1353/jod.2004.0055', '10.1525/curh.2006.105.693.307', '10.1353/jod.2015.0028', '10.1515/9780804743730', '10.1080/09592310902975455', '10.1007/978-3-319-96758-5', '10.2307/1149563', '10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00500.x', '10.1057/9781137489449_2', '10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628', '10.1080/09668130701489204', '10.3200/DEMO.15.2.209-229']",SAGE Publications

10.1093/alh/ajab079,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Remediations in an Emergency,[],"Abstract This essay argues that configurations of what we have been calling “method” will not save the humanities from the compounding disasters of austerity, and that pretending this is not so makes for an especially airless kind of criticism. It tracks the insalubrious persistence of a critical grammar across the terrain of method polemicizing. “Method Wars,” it argues, have bequeathed to us nothing so much as an intricate machinery for metabolizing variance in approach as antagonism, the better to produce differing inflections of the fairly standard practice of “reading” as innovations of “method” that, through the rupturing force of their departures, might rescue the declining humanities. But the decimation of the humanities is, paradigmatically, a problem of structural disinvestment proper to the Long Downturn—a problem, that is, of political–economic conditions. Whatever their virtues or liabilities, our methods do not remake those conditions, though pretending that they might imparts a doomed glamour to our conceptual labors. Doing without that pretense, the essay contends, enables a larger purchase on the invigoratingly synthesizing critical projects that have flourished across the discipline—projects that are of more use to us in their fractious noncoincidence than their polemical overcoming. “Financialization” is Giovanni Arrighi’s term for what happens to capitalist systems in the long last moments of their lurch toward collapse. “Method wars,” a friend recently suggested, “are the financialization of academic literary criticism.”","[('Peter Coviello', '')]","['10.1177/1463499616688157', '10.7208/chicago/9780226729770.001.0001', '10.7208/chicago/9780226294179.001.0001', '10.1515/9781400830855', '10.1179/1041257314Z.00000000051']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Removing Troilus and Criseyde's affair from the constraints of a “sexual” narrative unveils an alternative Middle English metaphorical language of embodied desire that disrupts modern expectations of arousal. This article promotes a methodological initiative in the cultural development and understanding of embodied feelings, especially those related to arousal, in order to respond to the poetic construction of an ethically-engaged love-prone reader in the medieval poem. By focusing on the depiction of intimacy and desire in Book III, this article queries the narrative basis of sexual intercourse as a consummation-driven activity, and the teleological basis of sexual intercourse as a manifestation of biological purpose or a matter of “human nature.”","[('Clare Davidson', 'University of Western Australia, Crowley, Australia, (clare.davidson@uwa.edu.au)')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

Through a reading of Chang-rae Lee’s On Such a Full Sea (2014) and other texts, the article develops the term studious deracination to refer to a narrative strategy defined by an evacuated racial consciousness that is used to ironize assumptions of white universalism and uncritical postracialism. Studious deracination challenges medical discourse’s “color-blind” approach to healthcare and enables a reconsideration of comparative racialization in a moment of accelerating social disintegration and blasted landscapes. Indeed, while precision medicine promises to replace race with genomics, Asian American literature is key to showing how this “postracial” promise depends on framing racial inequality as a symptom, rather than an underlying etiology, of infrastructures of public health.","[('Michelle N.

In these staged photographs, Kreutzberg and Georgi present their distinctive brand of modernist movement aesthetics, which both Orientalized and queered the dancing body. In cultivating a queer indeterminacy, these dancers embraced the emancipatory ethos of Weimar modernism, but by treating the East as an amalgamized, exotic source for civilizational regeneration, they exploited non‐white cultures and became vulnerable to, and later complicit in, the instrumentalization of their dance aesthetics by the Nazi regime.","[('Wesley Lim', 'Australian National University')]","['10.1007/978-3-476-04258-3', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199916559.001.0001', '10.1353/tj.2007.0105', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199377329.001.0001', '10.1086/494712', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199844814.001.0001', '10.1093/oso/9780190679699.001.0001', '10.1111/gequ.12049', '10.7312/hall18762', '10.1017/S0149767720000352', '10.1017/S014976771600019X', '10.12987/yale/9780300189452.001.0001', '10.1515/9781503618435', '10.13110/discourse.39.1.0092', '10.1515/9781400846788-017', '10.1017/S0307883306002082', '10.1017/S0149767700000656', '10.1017/S0149767700007567', '10.1093/oso/9780190659370.001.0001', '10.1080/00918369.2018.1555391', '10.1215/9780822381860', '10.3998/mpub.17012', '10.1525/9780520918276', '10.1515/9783839429945-001']",Wiley

Even as we face a racial crisis in the US, there is a looming, similarly daunting challenge in environmental change. Locating forms of progressive environmental ideas that think simultaneously about race and racialization is crucial if we are to meet these twin challenges. This essay introduces a mode of comparative analysis that places multiple genres and forms (novels, films, visual art, and short stories) created by authors from multiple Latinx communities (Chicanx, Puerto Rican, Peruvian, and Central American) into conversation. This comparative approach provides a more nuanced account of how Latinxs from multiple racial, class, gender, sexual, and other identity positions think about and represent environmental ideas. As the legatees of colonialism and racism, Latinx artists have much to say about combatting, circumventing, and, at times, proposing remedies for oppression and environmental harm as complex, interrelated phenomena. These authors and artists comprehend racial capitalism as directly causing environmental crises that perform in concert with racism and colonialism.","[('David J Vázquez', '')]","['10.1353/ncr.0.0008', '10.2307/j.ctvpj7478']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The essay focuses specifically on contexts of mid-century eugenics, which exposed black Americans, often women, to nonconsensual and nontherapeutic surgical procedures. I argue that Home is not only informed by these traumatic histories of medical violence but is also able to construct an ethics of care out of them through the imperative of loving mean–a de-idealized love concerned less with sympathy than with survival. In so doing, the novel advances intersubjective forms of healing that challenge the systemic roots of reproductive racism and make possible the potential for meaningful recovery from both physical and historical trauma.","[('James Fitz Gerald', 'Bentley University, USA')]","['10.1093/oso/9780195188585.001.0001', '10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.012631', '10.6018/ijes/14/1/179921', '10.1353/book4803', '10.2307/j.ctt1pwt69x', '10.2307/3052796', '10.2105/AJPH.2006.095406', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190251635.001.0001', '10.2307/j.ctt1g2km9c']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Along the way, it models a method for reading “imagined environments”—the frameworks through which human groups have represented, related to, and resided in their more-than-human worlds. This article focuses on two generations of writer-activists. In the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, Adelina Otero-Warren and Fabiola Cabeza de Baca situated themselves in the Precarious Desert, an imagined environment of constraints, contingencies, and struggles for survival. Then, in the 1960s and 1970s, the Alianza Federal de Mercedes revived the Pueblo Olvidado, an imagined environment saturated with laws, treaties, and cultural traditions. Despite many differences, both generations shared a desire to settle on and profit from Native lands. But though they never became environmentalists, they experimented with environmental writing and politics. By recovering these experiments, this article shows how media produce—rather than simply portray—lands and waters. Ultimately it tells the story of the borderlands as a series of struggles over what environments are, whom they can contain, and how they should be used.","[('Carlos Alonso Nugent', '')]","['10.5749/minnesota/9780816670864.001.0001', '10.4159/9780674020993', '10.1086/596640', '10.4159/harvard.9780674073913', '10.1353/book21736', '10.1515/9780691221304', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195335637.001.0001', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816672318.001.0001', '10.4159/harvard.9780674061194', '10.1080/17541320802063570', '10.2307/467466', '10.1353/book.52311', '10.5149/northcarolina/9781469633824.001.0001', '10.1093/oso/9780195153989.003.0009', '10.2307/j.ctv11hpp7d', '10.5749/jcritethnstud.3.1.0059']",Duke University Press

Against this confusion, we argue that it is a quest to reconcile his sense of self and understanding of life that drives Suttree's actions throughout the novel, this quest illuminating not only McCarthy's well-documented critique of Western culture but, more importantly, his own alternative conception of life, this alternative an egalitarian vision of society that brings to light the novel's ethical imperative.","[('Jonathan Elmore', ''), ('Rick Elmore', '')]","['10.5325/cormmccaj.17.2.0148', '10.1177/014833310405300308', '10.1353/aph.2011.a416563', '10.1353/slj.2013.0009']",The Pennsylvania State University Press
10.1515/zrp-2020-0004,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ROMANISCHE PHILOLOGIE,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Leon and Palencia: Two intonation patterns in the absolute neutral interrogatives in current European Spanish,[],"Abstract The spoken Spanish in Leon and Palencia, in the northwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula, bears traces of the historical development at various different linguistic levels. The main aim of this study is to describe the prosody of open questions in the speech of each of the two cities and compare these prosodic patterns with those of other points in the Peninsula and islands (the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands), and those of the Asturian accent of Oviedo. The research falls within the general framework of the projects undertaken for the AMPER (Contini 1992) and the methodology employed in so called dialectometry (Goebl 1981) based on the tool ProDis (Elvira-García/Balocco/Roseano/Fernández Planas 2018; Fernández Planas 2016 a, 2016 b; Fernández Planas/Roseano/Elvira-García/Balocco 2017a). The work is being carried out with data from 20 informants from 12 survey points, with a large corpus of more than 4000 open questions. The results show that the two above-mentioned survey points have different intonation melodies. We would like to see this work as a contribution to the study of diachronic prosody using instrumentation.","[('Ana Ma.

10.3366/nfs.2020.0296,NOTTINGHAM FRENCH STUDIES,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,LIVING AS WE DREAM: AUTOMATISM AND AUTOMATION FROM SURREALISM TO STIEGLER,[],"In his 2011 French Studies article ‘Leroi-Gourhan and the Limits of the Human’, Chris Johnson traced André Leroi-Gourhan's ethnography of the imbrication of the biological, cultural, and technological in Le Geste et la parole (1964). Johnson placed special emphasis on how Leroi-Gourhan's narrative culminates in a speculative vision of a homo post-sapiens: a limit-experience in which our species evolves beyond the human as we understand it in an increasingly automated world. This article takes up the conceptual genealogy surrounding Leroi-Gourhan to focus on the interaction between his work and that of his unruly predecessor André Breton, and heir, Bernard Stiegler. Taking as its starting point the linguistic contagion of automatism and automation, it will argue that Stiegler's contemporary reflections on our ‘automatic society’ are rooted in a Bretonian surrealist preoccupation with the automatic – not as a category of alienation, but as a wellspring of creativity, dreams, and subjectivity unfurling in language. Understanding how contemporary French technocritical thought has filtered down from avant-garde artistic movements through anthropology in an unruly technocritical genealogy offers an opportunity to reclaim the notion of the automatic, and to reconfigure our expectations and plans for our technological future.","[('Madeleine Chalmers', '')]",[],Edinburgh University Press
10.5325/chaucerrev.56.2.0095,CHAUCER REVIEW,0502 Foreign Language and Literature; 0603 World History,Katharine Lee Bates and Chaucer's American Children,[],"ABSTRACT Katharine Lee Bates, most famous as the author of America the Beautiful, was also a field-changing scholar of American literature whose early training was as a medievalist. To a widely ignored early-twentieth-century children's edition of Chaucer (The Story of Chaucer's Canterbury Pilgrims, 1909), she brought both her originality and democratic instincts as a scholar and her considerable talents as a poet. This edition deserves close inspection as both a skillful popularization and a strategic intervention in the history of Chaucer scholarship and translation. It was unusual for its time in rendering Chaucer in verse rather than prose, in representing the best contemporary scholarship about the Middle Ages, and in stressing the novelistic aspects of the Canterbury Tales, as well as in the liberties it took with the original, laying an American claim to Chaucer. It thus reflected the middle way that Bates took in much of her writing between traditionalism and innovation.","[('Kathryn L.

Pressure building since the death of Parnell in 1891 would lead to Ireland’s independence from Britain and the establishment of the Irish free State in 1922, with Shaw’s Irish friends Horace Plunkett, Augusta Gregory, George Russell (“Æ”), and especially W. B. Yeats all prime movers in major new national cultural institutions that sprang up around the turn of the century. Through these four as well as his Irish wife, Charlotte Shaw, Shaw became involved in both the affairs of the nation as well as in Irish drama, especially Dublin’s Abbey Theatre. Yeats and his work were particularly important for Shaw’s contributions to the Irish literary revival, in which, whether in satirical, comic, or tragic modes, his Irish plays comprehend Irish mythology, history, imagination, and religious salvation.","[('Peter Gahan', '')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press
10.1215/00029831-8878506,AMERICAN LITERATURE,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Genres of Valuation: Marginalist Economics and American Literary Realism,[],"Abstract This essay argues that late nineteenth-century American fiction, as exemplified by William Dean Howells’s The Rise of Silas Lapham (1885) and Theodore Dreiser’s Sister Carrie (1900), is entangled in the period’s embrace of a new understanding of economic conditions, one premised on the significance of consumer data as the raw material of economic interpretation and fixated on mathematical analysis as a source of knowledge about value. Marginalism in economic theory and realism in American literary practice were contemporaneous efforts to mediate value at a moment of decisive transition in America, as a model of commodity-centered competitive capitalism yielded to the regime of corporate finance. The young academic economists of the period and their literary counterparts explained the economic landscape in much the same way and to many of the same ends. Both began with the daunting question of how to reimagine value in a world characterized by fictitious goods and increasingly abstract financial instruments, a world in which the labor theory of value seemed hopelessly outdated. Both responded to this challenge by proposing novel intellectual procedures for making values appear stable again by focusing on the subjective experiences of consumers. Finally, both marginalists and realists sought to provide a quasi-scientific bedrock for fixing values in consumer society not only by appealing nostalgically to an economy of actual goods and honest work but more importantly by accommodating readers, policy makers, and stakeholders of all kinds to the new realities of finance capitalism.","[('Henry B.

I will focus primarily on the idea of the transmigration of the soul, which comes from the religion of the Akan people, and on the Sankofa symbol, which stands for a certain attitude towards history. In the novel, Ghanaian wisdom poetry, which traditionally deals with the boundary between life and death and the development of the self within the community, is translated into German prose. I aim to explore the significance of Ghanaian religion and philosophy in shaping the overarching ethical idea underlying Adas Raum. At the heart of this ethical idea is learning from history, which is presented not only as a history of catastrophe but also as a history of mutual care between human beings who support each other in times of inhumanity.","[('Kyung‐Ho Cha', 'Leibniz‐Zentrum für Literatur‐ und Kulturforschung  Berlin')]",[],Wiley

Aside from portraying the marked homophobia that continues to circulate on the African continent, the institutional and state responses to the films have overshadowed the positive popular reception which has characterised conversations around the films on social media and public spaces. This article shows how social media functions as animportant space of contestation for diverse issues relating to non-normative gender and sexual identities. As these films circulate in different spaces and are viewed by diverse audiences, they elicit equally diverse reactions and responses. The article examines how viewers, in Africa and beyond, receive and engage with the queerness represented in the two films. It argues that the multifaceted reactions to Inxeba/The Wound and Rafiki are central to articulating important questions about what it means to be queer in Africa,and particularly what it implies for black queers to inhabit heteronormative and patriarchal spaces on the continent. Through an analysis of the reactions and receptions of the two films in Africa and the global North, it is argued that it is possible to trace important inter-regional, intra-continental and intercontinental dialogues and conversations regarding the representation of queer African subjectivities. The intra-continental and inter-continental dialogues bring to light questions of gaze and viewing that are inherent in the circulation of queer-themed films.&#x0D; Kewords: Inxeba/The Wound, Rafiki, reception, popular culture, queerness","[('Gibson Ncube', '')]",[],African Journals Online (AJOL)

This article examines Shaw's influence on ELIZA and his anticipatory engagement with questions about machine “thinking” and the origin and nature of intelligence that continue to drive research in computer science.

By bringing Jacques Rancière’s works on politics and depoliticisation into dialogue with poststructuralist discourse analysis, the article argues that discursive depoliticisation contributes towards authoritarian consolidation and shows how authoritarianism deepens in a co-dependent nexus of domestic and international politics. Focusing in particular on Rancière’s concept of gaps, the article argues that the core mechanism of depoliticisation is to neutralise the gap constitutive of politics proper and that this neutralisation unfolds in discourse, through the logics of archipolitics, parapolitics, metapolitics and ultrapolitics. The article (1) develops a framework for unpacking discursive depoliticisation empirically by conceptualising Rancière’s logics as ideal-typical depoliticising discourses and (2) applies that framework in an analysis of Russian official discourse in recent years (2015–2023). The article thereby explains how discursive constructions have strengthened Russian autocracy: entrenched depoliticising discourses, produced and reinforced in a co-constitutive internal/external sphere, made possible authoritarian consolidation in Russia under Putin and its war on Ukraine. The article puts forward the concept of discursive depoliticisation as a novel perspective on ‘hybrid’ and authoritarian regimes, as well as Russia’s intensified war on Ukraine and full-on autocracy from 2022 onwards.","[('Anni Roth Hjermann', 'University of Cambridge, UK')]","['10.1353/jod.2022.0043', '10.1057/s41599-018-0148-y', '10.1057/cpt.2008.4', '10.1353/jod.2002.0003', '10.2753/PPC1075-8216600301', '10.1080/21599165.2015.1063487', '10.1177/0090591702239444', '10.1080/09668136.2016.1204985', '10.3998/mpub.7106945', '10.18449/2021C40', '10.1080/13523260.2022.2082633', '10.1080/13600820701740746', '10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00396.x', '10.4324/9780203966730', '10.1353/jod.2006.0030', '10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0011', '10.1353/jod.2020.0049', '10.1111/j.1467-9248.2008.00735.x', '10.1017/CBO9780511781353', '10.1080/07388940701860318', '10.1080/17448689.2013.818767', '10.1080/02634937.2016.1161902', '10.2753/PPC1075-8216550506', '10.1080/09557571.2019.1590314', '10.1080/14623528.2022.2074947', '10.1080/14631377.2016.1139303', '10.1080/13569310306088', '10.1017/S0037677900019707', '10.3366/edinburgh/9780748624973.001.0001', '10.1162/isec_a_00390', '10.1353/jod.2021.0049', '10.1177/1354066199005002003', '10.1080/13501760500451709', '10.1177/1354066106067346', '10.1057/9781137409300', '10.1017/nps.2022.112', '10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001', '10.1111/1468-2346.12752', '10.1080/09668136.2020.1815654', '10.1080/02634937.2016.1245181', '10.1080/1060586X.2016.1251023', '10.1353/jod.2022.0015', '10.1080/13534640902982983', '10.2747/1060-586X.26.3.185', '10.1080/09668136.2014.1002680', '10.1177/2336825X221132937', '10.7591/9781501718397', '10.4324/9780203814932', '10.1080/00905992.2014.917075', '10.1080/09668136.2012.661935', '10.4324/9780203559390', '10.4324/9780203018200', '10.1080/09557571.2018.1564899', '10.1016/j.euras.2015.04.001', '10.1007/s11186-011-9161-5', '10.1080/00472330701408635', '10.1080/10758216.2020.1788397', '10.1177/0010836716648725', '10.1080/09668136.2019.1602594', '10.2307/20048274']",SAGE Publications

We propose to defend the relevance of placing the focus of attention on the unitary whole formed by content-teachinglearning. We will develop arguments around some basic issues that are the object of a wide debate in the disciplinary field of Language Didactics. Studies of sociocultural orientation consider that placing grammar in the use-communication axis (beyond a formal axis, in which the grammar system is approached as autonomous with respect the communicative uses), as well as consider interaction as not only a desirable classroom resource but what fuels learning and development, in which the student is involved in processes of reflection or “metalinguistic activity”. The study of this metalinguistic activity can contribute knowledge about the best measures that can be arbitrated for the teaching and learning of grammar as well as for teacher education.","[('Xavier Fontich', '')]","['10.17239/L1ESLL-2018.18.04.01', '10.5565/rev/jtl3.869', '10.4067/S0718-48832016000200004', '10.5565/rev/regroc.18', '10.3726/978-3-0352-6490-6', '10.7203/caplletra.63.10400', '10.5117/9789053563410', '10.7203/caplletra.63.10395', '10.7203/caplletra.63.10396', '10.1017/S0261444809990139', '10.1177/0959354311419252', '10.5565/rev/regroc.16', '10.1111/lnc3.12184', '10.1111/lnc3.12273', '10.1080/02671522.2013.813579', '10.17239/L1ESLL-2018.18.04.02', '10.1037/0022-0663.99.3.445', '10.5565/rev/regroc.10', '10.4324/9780203813850', '10.3406/rfp.1985.1543', '10.5565/rev/regroc.17', '10.4324/9780203854358', '10.15581/008.34.1.262-85', '10.1080/00461520.2013.804394', '10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.10.005', '10.1007/978-1-4020-2739-0_5', '10.3726/978-3-0352-6490-6', '10.1017/CBO9780511736582', '10.1080/02671522.2011.637640', '10.3917/cdle.022.0003', '10.17239/L1ESLL-2019.19.02.01', '10.3726/978-3-0352-6490-6', '10.1080/11356405.2015.1089388', '10.7203/caplletra.63.10401', '10.1080/09658416.2017.1410552', '10.1080/02671522.2018.1493742', '10.1174/021470394321466873']",Universidad de Navarra
10.5325/chaucerrev.55.4.0379,CHAUCER REVIEW,0502 Foreign Language and Literature; 0603 World History,Chaucer's Fantasy of Pity,[],"Abstract In his term pitee, Chaucer develops in the Knight's Tale a concept that draws upon Seneca's De clementia and Statius's Thebiad. In his version, he conflates pity's role as a virtue of sovereignty (in acts of clemency and mercy in judgment) with its affective forms (compassion and sympathy). Chaucer emphasizes a vulnerability common to all, but also uses the resulting fellow-feeling to shore up patriarchal sovereign power. Principally, Chaucer produces through his concept of pitee a male fantasy of female resistance to patriarchy: rather than depicting the political collective action (and just violence) of the Amazons in Boccaccio's Teseida, the Knight's Tale limits female resistance to a non-violent desire for autonomy, a female subjectivity that men can appropriate emotionally through shared feeling, but that does not threaten patriarchy. By both engaging and shaping readers' affectivity, Chaucer obscures with seemingly universal emotions the justice of collective female resistance to masculine domination.","[('Matthew W.

The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and uprisings in Ferguson, Missouri, from the same year, when situated in dialogue with Whitehead’s text, show that black insecurity reframes the spatio-temporal notion of survival by unmasking security structures as dead and dying. Engaged from the standpoint of ongoing racial justice protests and stay-at-home conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, “Black Insecurity at the End of the World” argues that black speculative fictions uniquely expose the false premises of securitization and show that black love is an essential process for unmaking the forces of anti-Blackness.","[('Justin L Mann', 'Northwestern University, USA')]","['10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190624477.003.0002', '10.2307/j.ctv14gpj55', '10.1215/01642472-8352223', '10.3828/extr.2010.51.3.7', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816678952.001.0001', '10.1215/9780822372554', '10.1215/10407391-6-2-3-126', '10.1057/9781137545848', '10.1353/jaas.2017.0006', '10.3828/extr.2015.17', '10.1515/9780823277780', '10.36019/9780813568850', '10.7312/mart18192', '10.1215/10642684-2721366', '10.1353/nar.2013.0000', '10.1215/9780822371830', '10.18574/nyu/9780814740941.001.0001', '10.1353/cli.2014.0029', '10.1215/00166928-2797225', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816687268.001.0001', '10.1353/aq.2014.0015']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

It examines the Bannatyne as a locus for the querelle des femmes, and interrogates the idea that Chaucer becomes a “straw man” for the writers included in the anthology. The idea of a “straw man” requires a context that involves the number of “Chaucerian” texts in the manuscript. Three selections from the manuscript are examined: the “song of troyelus,” read as an example of an implicit antipathy towards women; the erroneously attributed “lettre of cupeid,” considered as an example of profeminine verse, with caveats; and Gavin Douglas's Eneados. An argument is made for a “Chaucer” who is at once a source of multifaceted approaches to women, a useful narrative tool for the compiler, and a key locus for intersecting themes in the Bannatyne Manuscript.","[('Lucy R.

By reading these texts through Cedric Robinson’s theorization of the Black Radical Tradition, which “never allowed for property,” this essay argues that both texts bring into being a world that precedes and exceeds the violence of legal regulation. Jacobs and Long Soldier both locate an alternative to law in the radical divinity of maternal care. Through Jacobs’s and Long Soldier’s discussions of holy maternal care, we can recognize the interrelation of Black and Indigenous freedom struggles in a way that’s not solely defined by shared subjugation.","[('Hannah Manshel', '')]","['10.5749/j.ctvn96fp5', '10.7208/chicago/9780226241111.001.0001', '10.1215/23289252-3815069', '10.5749/jcritethnstud.5.1-2.0207', '10.1215/01642472-7370991', '10.5422/fordham/9780823274543.001.0001', '10.5749/jcritethnstud.1.2.0102', '10.5204/ijcis.v1i1.20', '10.2307/1341787', '10.2307/j.ctv1c5cx3b', '10.4324/9780203451731', '10.1525/9780520335370', '10.1353/eal.2020.0063', '10.2307/2927835', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816692149.001.0001', '10.1353/ncr.2005.0009', '10.1080/07407700701387317', '10.1215/00382876-2345261', '10.1215/9780822372028-014', '10.2979/meridians.11.2.1', '10.5749/j.ctt1pwt77c', '10.2307/464747', '10.4159/9780674054721', '10.17953/aicrj.43.2.warren', '10.2307/j.ctv11cw61k']",Duke University Press
10.1093/alh/ajaa023,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"""Dear Anglo"": Scrambling the Signs of Anglo-Modernity from New York to Lagos",[],"AbstractThis essay reveals the surprising ties within an African American print franchise: the Anglo-African Magazine, the Weekly Anglo-African, and their various iterations between 1859 and 1865 and a Lagos journal also titled The Anglo-African (1863–65). The link was Robert Campbell, the West Indian editor of the Lagos paper and former contributor to the New York ones. I show how Campbell not only borrowed his title from his African American colleagues but also adapted their editorial models for hailing abolitionist publics and constituting interpretative communities. As these Anglo-African journals proliferated from New York to Lagos, “Anglo-African” became a racialized title associated with a particular kind of journal, rather than just a racial term. A salient feature of an “Anglo-African” type of journal was its scrambling of its titular term and its prefix Anglo. Thus, in the US papers, Anglo became a shorthand for a black publication, while their Nigerian counterpart inserted the US and African-America into the “Anglo” world of the Lagos Anglo-African. By decoupling “Anglo” from whiteness in one context, and from Britishness in the other, these editors forged a black Atlantic counterculture that worked at what Paul Gilroy has called the “hidden internal fissures” of modernity.","[('Marina Bilbija', '')]","['10.1017/CBO9780511619656', '10.1215/00029831-2008-005', '10.1080/00064246.2000.11431102', '10.1353/cal.2011.0029', '10.1353/book46211', '10.1093/alh/ajy015', '10.2307/j.ctvgs08p1.5', '10.1353/yale.1997.0020', '10.1093/alh/aji042', '10.1017/S0021875818001317', '10.3998/mpub.8833121', '10.9783/9780812295771', '10.7208/chicago/9780226789439.001.0001', '10.2307/j.ctv3znzrx.5']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The focus is on how the relationship between the fictional city and its referential counterpart is foregrounded as well as undermined in a way that destabilizes the ontological status of the storyworlds. Key concepts used in the analysis of the literary space and storyworld are Brian McHale’s “flickering effect” and Bertrand Westphal’s “heterotopic interference.” Deleuze’s “fold” is proposed as a heuristic concept to describe how ontological instability in postmodern storyworlds is shaped.

Given that the collaborative craft of editors is often invisible, the study of editorship requires attending to the practices, habits, and techniques of editing as themselves historically contingent and significant objects of inquiry. This essay analyzes a cross section of editorial practices in 1862 when a controversy during the Civil War over slavery and emancipation entangled editors from Horace Greeley and Frederick Douglass to their less conspicuous peers at L’Union (a bilingual, Black Creole weekly in New Orleans). These examples reveal the practical language of editorship expressed through serial formats.

Feminist Ambivalence in Contemporary Literary Criticism,[],"AbstractFeminism exists in a perpetual identity crisis—with a vexed past, an unstable present, and an uncertain future. A scholar interested in this charged identity must manage such existential conditions in order to enable their transformative ambitions. Historicizing Post-Discourses (2017), Bodies of Information (2019), and Selling Women’s History (2017) take up this cognitive and corporeal challenge and largely meet it. In these three books, feminism’s endemic ambivalence becomes a resource for literary and cultural criticism. Focused on popular, digital, and material cultures in the twentieth- and twenty-first-century US, these volumes dramatize the merits and drawbacks of irresolution and resist a definitive conclusion about what feminism, both past and present, necessarily means for contemporary scholarship. Instead, we get alternative archives and, hopefully, better practices. Analyzing mass media, data visualizations, and consumer products, these studies engage new materials to flesh out the gendered, racialized human body at their common center. They rethink feminist historiography and demonstrate the myriad ways in which the sense of an ending continually renews and unsettles feminism’s search for a useable past. These works aim to create strategic alliances: they drive at embodied, material concerns, foreground questions of pedagogy and other modes of public interchange, and embrace a style of advocacy that rejects such extreme position-taking and instead embraces ambivalence.","[('Lisa Mendelman', '')]","['10.1515/9781438464794', '10.36019/9780813576350']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

In 1963, Martin Luther King famously stated, ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."" However, in the decades after the civil rights movement, the ideology of colorblindness co-opted the language of the civil rights era in order to reinvent white supremacy, fuel the rise of neoliberalism, and dismantle the civil rights movement’s legal victories without offending political decorum. Yet, the spread of colorblindness could not merely happen through political speeches, newspapers, or books. The key, Justin Gomer contends, was film--as race-conscious language was expelled from public discourse, Hollywood provided the visual medium necessary to dramatize an anti–civil rights agenda over the course of the 70s, 80s, and 90s.In blockbusters like Dirty Harry, Rocky, and Dangerous Minds, filmmakers capitalized upon the volatile racial, social, and economic struggles in the decades after the civil rights movement, shoring up a powerful, bipartisan ideology that would be wielded against race-conscious policy, the memory of black freedom struggles, and core aspects of the liberal state itself.","[('Justin Gomer', '')]",[],University of North Carolina Press

We show how the key drivers of shifting global powers, the failure to build an inclusive European project and patchy transnational governance lead to a situation of permanent grey, in which some actors exploit the ambiguity between war and peace to their advantage, while others fail to even realize what is happening. The consequences include different forms of violence and suffering outside of traditional battlefields. Questioning the analytical value of concepts such as grey zone, hybrid and political warfare, we argue that a positive future of peace and the necessary management of the grey zone absent effective global governance require a better and more honest understanding of violence and domination in both war and peacetime. With clearly delineated battlefields gone, so must be the illusion that universal peace existed outside of them.","[('Sarah Bressan', 'Global Public Policy Institute (GPPi), Germany'), ('Mari-Liis Sulg', 'University of Tartu, Estonia')]","['10.1215/9780822387541', '10.2307/2538951', '10.4324/9780429443442', '10.1002/9780470672532.wbepp189', '10.1080/13523279.2011.544381', '10.1162/DAED_a_00416', '10.1093/oso/9780190253301.001.0001']",SAGE Publications

Historical scholarship has long assessed the mania for cutting roads and canals into the landscape. But engaging an emerging infrastructuralism—and turning to imaginative texts that exist underneath the ground typically trod by US literary studies, from Philip Freneau’s celebratory ode to the Erie Canal to Harriet Beecher Stowe’s and Nathaniel Hawthorne’s ironic canal travel sketches to Margarita Engle’s recent historical verse-novel tallying the devastations of the Panama Canal—this essay identifies an infrastructural dialectic in which writers view infrastructure, initially, as awesome so as to justify its ecological and social violence and, subsequently, as banal so as to render it invisible within the settler state. Oscillating between awe and irritation, the sublime and the stuplime, then, these texts both expose the rhythm of infrastructure’s long—that is, low—relation to the structure of coloniality and, in Engle’s case, model how to disrupt it so as to imagine a more just life “after” infrastructure.","[('Andrew Kopec', '')]","['10.1177/0263775816645989', '10.1177/0306312712440166', '10.1093/envhis/emv165', '10.1017/S1537781415000572', '10.1093/alh/ajz035', '10.5962/bhl.title.33130', '10.1525/RH.2011.29.1.53', '10.1215/00029831-4257847', '10.2307/1900027', '10.1093/whq/whv039', '10.1080/09502380601162498', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816665778.001.0001', '10.2307/302817', '10.1353/mfs.2015.0049', '10.1353/eal.2018.0070', '10.1111/gec3.12377', '10.1215/00138282-55.1-2.153', '10.3167/ares.2018.090109', '10.1080/14623520601056240', '10.1093/alh/ajy011', '10.1353/ncr.2004.0015']",Duke University Press

10.1093/alh/ajac176,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"Voting in the Reconstruction Novel: Black Suffrage, Election-Day Violence, and the Regulation of the Vote",[],"AbstractHow did fiction respond to the expansions of democracy during the Reconstruction period? This article provides a survey of Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction novels that include scenes of Black electoral participation. Such scenes of voting are also scenes of violence, either threatened or realized, and represent a range of political views. The article explores how novels use such scenes to advocate radical protections of Black voting rights, white supremacist restrictions on Black suffrage, and liberal policies of nonintervention in elections. A set of post-Reconstruction writers asserted a position as expressly moderate between the latter two: that Black political participation must be regulated. These novels pair the threat of Black voting with the civic emergencies of floods and other natural disasters in order to make the regulation of voting rights as necessary for survival as the management of a rising river. This view, positioned as a compromise between the rights provided by the Fifteenth Amendment and the fears of white reactionaries, was shared, alongside similar water metaphors, in the consequential decisions on voting rights by the period’s Supreme Court. This article shows the range of novelistic responses in the wake of the Fifteenth Amendment and the shaping of a self-consciously moderate stance that ultimately supported the national policy of Black disenfranchisement.Liberals [could] square voting regulations with their belief in laissez-faire government . . . by treating electoral reform like the management of natural phenomena, a science of managing threats as in the linked rising tides of river and Black politics in [the period’s novels].","[('Andrew Donnelly', '')]",['10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780195385342.003.0005'],Oxford University Press (OUP)

A significant portion of both tales relates the direct discourse of women, namely Prudence and the Manciple's mother. Chaucer uses these ventriloquized women to transform continental sources into male English voices, articulating the (re)productive potential of the literary tradition in his native vernacular. Unlike the Wife of Bath (who famously has no children), neither woman addresses the pilgrims in her own voice: it is the Chaucer pilgrim, the Manciple, and Chaucer himself who derive authority via their imported wisdom. Recognizing the ventriloquism of maternal voices in Melibee and the Manciple's Tale reveals that both tales continue to debate the woman question and help to construct Chaucer as the representative voice of Middle English literature.","[('Wendy A.

The character's peacock-fletched arrows are perhaps the most frequently misinterpreted component of his arms. This article contextualizes the peacock fletching of the Yeoman's arrows by explicating birdwing anatomy, the appearance of various peacock feathers, medieval fletching practices, and historical references to peacock-fletched arrows. Rather than being ostentatious, peacock fletching was mundane—unless enhanced by decorative embellishments. Based on reported uses of peacock-fletched arrows, it appears likely that esteem for such arrows was based more on performance than appearance, and a subsequent analysis of how the Yeoman's fletching is likely trimmed supports the tactical utility of his arrows. In this light, the Yeoman's “pecok arwes” suggest that he is a consummate bowman and a lethally effective companion to the Knight.","[('Kenneth J.

Subsidence not only describes an actual process of sinking land in the US Gulf Coast bioregion but also refigures how those who study climate change can understand and address its material effects. A focus on subsidence makes visible the sometimes-invisible infrastructure of the ground, and analysis scaled to the figure of subsidence forces a reorientation of vision—away from rising sea levels and toward the destabilizing loss of land. From this perspective, Ward’s fiction identifies histories of colonial engineering, extraction, and displacement as key ecological dangers. Unsettling national narratives of the Gulf Coast, Ward’s subsident figurations connect issues of environmental emergency to structures of environmental racism, which unevenly enhance the precarity of certain communities by diminishing the ecological infrastructures of their lands.

In each case, the inherited propensity for immoral behavior stands in for the inherited bipolar disorder that affected both Wharton's husband, Teddy, and Hemingway himself. The authors implicitly evoke degeneration theory, an ugly offshoot of the pseudoscience of eugenics popular in early twentieth-century America, to explore the dangers of paternal inheritance. The negative eugenics widely accepted in America during the first half of the twentieth century would dictate that people with genetic mental illness should not be allowed to reproduce at all. Not surprisingly, the mother in Wharton's novella and the father in Hemingway's short story are each plagued by guilt over a son's immorality. In these critically neglected works of short fiction, a concerned parent broods over whether a child's hereditary propensities can be overcome by a loving upbringing and supportive environment. Both Wharton and Hemingway wrestled with bipolar disorder and its devastating symptoms in their own families and wrote stories in which they expressed personal and cultural anxieties about the illness's devastating impact.","[('Lisa Tyler', 'Sinclair Community College')]","['10.1353/hem.0.0023', '10.9783/9781512814293', '10.9783/9781512814309', '10.1002/9780470693506.ch2', '10.1525/9780520935129', '10.1353/hem.2007.0024', '10.1080/19359701003589637', '10.1017/CCOL0521453585.006', '10.1353/hem.2019.0007', '10.1215/00029831-3650223', '10.1353/afa.2011.0026', '10.1515/9780271079561', '10.1353/mml.2016.0045', '10.1057/9781137545794', '10.1353/hem.2001.0008', '10.1215/0041462X-2885176', '10.1017/CBO9780511558573', '10.23943/9781400890507', '10.1353/san.2013.0014', '10.1007/978-1-349-12389-6', '10.1086/415404', '10.1177/0952695102015001073', '10.1353/hem.2013.0010', '10.1353/hem.2004.0044', '10.1093/oso/9780195135909.003.0004', '10.1017/CBO9780511845659.029', '10.1057/9780230281332']",The Pennsylvania State University Press

This article investigates the role of empathy in literary reading by reconnecting it to its origins in the theories of Einfühlung and by revisiting these theories in the light of neuropsychological studies of embodied cognition carried out since the nineties. Contemporary to the coinage of the term empathy and to the broader dissemination of the notion of Einfühlung, Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis (1915) is here used as a test terrain for the hypotheses generated by this investigation. Kafka’s novella shows us how literature can use “fantastic cognition” (Kukkonen) to open a space of empathic indetermination in which the reader can resonate with structures of feeling extended beyond “normal” human sensorimotor forms.","[('Pierre-Louis Patoine', 'Université Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris, France')]","['10.2307/488401', '10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.03.010', '10.1038/nn1481', '10.2307/j.ctv12101zq', '10.3917/oj.berth.2015.01.0011', '10.7551/mitpress/6997.001.0001', '10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2004.11.001', '10.1093/cercor/bhn217', '10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.065', '10.1515/9783110365658', '10.4324/9780203505274', '10.1038/428603a', '10.1162/jocn_a_00487', '10.1017/CCOL0521482534.005', '10.1515/9781400824007', '10.1023/A:1004289113917', '10.1093/brain/120.10.1763', '10.1016/S0166-4328(05)80033-6', '10.7208/chicago/9780226145006.001.0001', '10.1007/s10339-017-0835-4', '10.1152/jn.1995.73.6.2608', '10.3917/rmm.174.0477', '10.2478/gth-2019-0013', '10.1080/02643290442000310', '10.1007/s10339-018-0861-x', '10.1006/nimg.1997.0293', '10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.02.025', '10.1353/phl.2001.0031', '10.4000/rgi.323', '10.5250/storyworlds.8.1.0001', '10.3758/BF03193983', '10.1016/j.tins.2016.01.004', '10.4324/9780203818336', '10.56021/9780801821011', '10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.07.015', '10.1126/science.66.1713.403.a', '10.1093/owc/9780199238552.001.0001', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195175769.001.0001', '10.1126/science.1070311', '10.1353/pan.2018.0020', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190496869.003.0009', '10.1111/j.1469-8986.1979.tb01511.x', '10.1017/S0269889712000105', '10.1016/j.pneurobio.2010.10.005', '10.3998/mpub.4585194', '10.1037/14276-000', '10.1057/9780230287525', '10.3758/CABN.4.2.270', '10.1093/brain/awy281', '10.2307/j.ctt1ww3vk3', '10.1093/cercor/bhl023', '10.4000/books.editionscnrs.32136', '10.1215/03335372-23-1-1', '10.1057/9780230370753_4', '10.1215/03335372-3160709', '10.1038/nature04271', '10.1126/science.1093535', '10.1038/nn0705-845', '10.1037/10877-000', '10.4324/9780203082591', '10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00337-3', '10.1016/j.tics.2006.08.008', '10.1353/mos.2012.a468707', '10.1111/nyas.14321', '10.2307/j.ctv11hpszq', '10.1111/pme.12785', '10.1007/978-1-4757-6779-7', '10.1111/ejn.14540']",University of Toronto Press Inc.

By doing so, a positive interdependence is generated and a real communication is emulated. At the same time, it is a learning experience in which the learners feel committed to their own learning process.

In her 2003 ASA presidential address, Kaplan posed the question, what should be the role of American studies scholars today, in the face of American empire today?—and together with Said, she answered it in a series of experiments with form. The essay, the address, and the book, all three reoriented toward making the personal = the political, become their routes to thinking empire as an ongoing historical subject, anarchic and incoherent rather than monolithic. The work on US empire in the 1980s, when Kaplan’s denial thesis on the absence of empire in American studies took hold and inspired so many scholars, is still present but with new terminology in new disciplinary locations. The larger function of criticism appears when we superimpose the timeline of earlier empire work onto other, current confluences of dates (the centenaries 1992/1998, 9/11, BLM, and COVID-19, 2019–2020) and speculate on the why of these still-open-ended key contexts, textual clusters of empire.","[('Susan Gillman', '')]","['10.1353/aq.2013.0029', '10.1353/aq.2004.0010', '10.4159/9780674989917']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Structure, Characteristics and Tradition in an Ejidal Festival",[],"El presente trabajo analiza una expresión de literatura de tradición oral de México: el huapango arribeño. La zona de influencia de esta tradición es la Zona Media de San Luis Potosí y la Sierra Gorda que abarca los estados de Guanajuato y Querétaro. Como eje central del análisis se encuentra la topada entre don Cándido Martínez y don Agapito Briones que se llevó a cabo el 16 de diciembre de 1987 en Villa Juárez, San Luis Potosí con motivo de un aniversario ejidal.El primer objetivo de este trabajo ha sido establecer vínculos entre la tradición del huapango arribeño y las otras manifestaciones de literatura popular que utilizan la glosa en décimas como estructura principal para sus composiciones. Se encontró que no sólo hay fórmulas y motivos recurrentes, sino que también se pueden encontrar formas de composición y recursos discursivos semejantes en distintas latitudes y todos ellos supeditados a la sintaxis de la décima.El segundo objetivo que se planteó fue establecer un diálogo con el cual se pudiera dilucidar el significado de la denominación “huapango arribeño”. En este sentido fue muy valiosa la aportación de Rolando Pérez, ya que se pudo vincular el aspecto festivo, ritual, con este concepto; además su propuesta de etimología múltiple fue muy sugerente para establecer que el concepto, en realidad, es complejo por los distintos elementos y características los que hace referencia.El tercer objetivo fue hacer un estudio sobre el contexto literario en el que surgió la décima y establecer la labor de Vicente Espinel con respecto a ella. Se pudo observar que los elementos que constituyen a esta estrofa ya existían con anterioridad a Espinel, esto sirvió de base para cambiar el enfoque y centrar la atención en la sintaxis de la décima y de las estrofas precedentes a ellas. Esta nueva perspectiva fue de gran ayuda para solventar la discusiónsobre el inventor de la estrofa y centrarla en la lógica discursiva inherente a esta estrofa y en la labor de sus cultores.El cuarto objetivo fue hacer un análisis de una topada con la intención de observar tópicos y fórmulas recurrentes. Un aspecto importante en este sentido fue observar la importancia que le dan los trovadores a los viejos maestros, a los cuales vinculan con el origen de la tradición. Además, se pudo apreciar que hay elementos recurrentes en el lenguaje y en el discurso que mantienen una línea de cohesión a lo largo de la topada y que esto configura el lenguaje particular de cada trovador, al mismo tiempo que le permite memorizar y recordar la gran cantidad de versos que canta en una noche.","[('Agustín Rodríguez Hernández', '')]","['10.5347/01856383.0021.000170583', '10.24201/nrfh.v49i2.2156', '10.24201/nrfh.v50i2.2197', '10.17561/blo.v10.5496', '10.2307/344531', '10.2307/454027', '10.7560/LAMR33202', '10.1215/9780822372202', '10.31819/9783865278043-018', '10.11647/OBP.0025', '10.2307/j.ctvhn07z8.16', '10.3406/carav.1998.2811', '10.19130/iifl.ap.2005.1-2.174', '10.2307/j.ctvbcd15p', '10.2307/j.ctv47w692.24', '10.2307/j.ctv47w7wq', '10.31819/9783865278043-019', '10.31819/9783865278043-003', '10.2307/469790', '10.2307/j.ctv47wf58.22', '10.2307/j.ctv47w565.13', '10.2307/j.ctv47wfc5', '10.2307/j.ctvx5w8bm.15', '10.2307/j.ctvx5w8bm.20', '10.2307/469766', '10.3989/rdtp.1997.v52.i1.346', '10.2307/j.ctv6jmx0x.27', '10.2307/j.ctvhn07z8.21']",Universidad de Jaen

In written and printed communication, sender and receiver need not be co‐present in the shared acoustic space of rhetoric. Klopstock avails himself of this qualitative “extension” of communicative channels in order to reach out to a broad, egalitarian audience. Informing his circulating texts with the emotive, conative, and performative properties of language crucial to rhetorical speech allows him to evoke a “voice” in the “ears” of his readers. That they can then lend their own voices to this voice lets the feedback of this amplificatory loop come full circle. For in receiving and emitting such a voice the audience does not simply become the loudspeaker of an authorial amplifier. Instead, Klopstock's odes pit their (lyrical) voice against their author‐function in such a way as to turn the audience into senders as well as receivers. Thus, poetry becomes a people's microphone. The ode “Der Grenzstein” from 1782 marks the border lines such a concept of lyric must cross.","[('Michael Auer', 'Ludwig‐Maximilians‐Universität, München')]","['10.1007/978-3-476-05568-2_2', '10.1111/j.1754-0208.2008.00006.x', '10.5771/9783968216669-53', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199347841.001.0001', '10.1515/9783110201772', '10.30965/9783846753460_003', '10.56021/9780801828430', '10.5771/9783835344471']",Wiley

The paper details the political and social contexts of each of these stage adaptations, as both of them employ brownface and blackface to visualise Othello’s “political colour.” The function of blackface and brownface is radically different in these two productions: in the 1981/1984 Othello brownface works to underline Othello’s overall sense of alienation, while strengthening the existing stereotypes surrounding black as a skin colour, while the 2011 staging makes the use of blackface as an artificial trick of the actor’s trade, potentially unmasking the constructedness of racial prejudices, while confronting the audience with their own pernicious racial stereotypes.","[('Anna Kowalcze-Pawlik', '')]","['10.1063/1.3034481', '10.1080/01419870.2020.1729390', '10.31338/uw.9788323538660', '10.2307/j.ctt212165r', '10.4135/9781483345239', '10.4324/9780203426050', '10.1080/10350330.2020.1766199', '10.4324/9781315168968-22', '10.7228/manchester/9781784992958.001.0001', '10.2307/j.ctv1131298', '10.1080/14788810.2018.1490508', '10.1515/9780822374565']",Uniwersytet Lodzki (University of Lodz)

The analysis shows how containers and boxes turn into open and porous spaces, places become strange, and global space grows into junkspace.

10.1215/00029831-8878494,AMERICAN LITERATURE,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"The Character Sketch, the Aesthetics of Representativeness, and Rip Van Winkle's Electoral Double Vision",[],"AbstractThis essay examines how a literary genre called the character sketch shaped the ways Americans came to understand electoral representation as representative. Now little known but central to eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century literary culture in the US and Britain, character sketches and a related aesthetic discourse about how to distinguish “well-drawn characters” from caricature helped to naturalize the notion that meaningful, legitimate representation should be grounded in clearly delineated categories and distinctions that were true to the “Laws of Nature and Nature’s God.” However, this aesthetic and political framework intersected uneasily with the early nineteenth century’s racially and economically diverse electoral public sphere. This public sphere was rife with fear that electoral “combinations” would so badly misrepresent the electorate that the United States would be functionally returned to tyranny. And these abstract fears often became entangled with the embodied discomfort genteel white men like Washington Irving experienced when “beer-barrel” politics brought them into contact with fellow voters whom they considered themselves naturally socially or racially distinct from. As a result, this paper shows, writing for and about early US elections—including Washington Irving’s “Rip Van Winkle” (1819), whose electoral plot is often overlooked—was imbued with a disconcerting sense of double vision. Only by recovering that double vision’s embodied and racialized electoral context can critics fully grapple with the aesthetic and political legacy of American literature’s uneasy foundations.","[('Leila Mansouri', '')]","['10.7756/rals.035.001.3-27', '10.9783/9780812206197', '10.1353/eal.2005.0051', '10.7591/9781501724169', '10.2307/2923379', '10.2307/j.ctvgd2nz', '10.1215/00029831-3149381', '10.9783/9780812200348', '10.9783/9780812205930', '10.1163/9789004456716', '10.1111/j.1467-8357.1994.tb00386.x', '10.1525/9780520340503', '10.1080/14664658.2011.559746', '10.1017/S0003055411000190', '10.9783/9780812295771', '10.1515/9780804782616', '10.1215/08992363-14-1-49']",Duke University Press

In many ways a condition of our historical present, waiting is frequently perceived and conceptualized by contemporary theorists as an exercise of utter emptiness, entrapment, and submission. A portrait of German refugees in transit in Marseille during World War Two and based on Anna Seghers's 1942 novel by the same name,Transitis attuned to the experience of flight and exile in both the past and the present. But instead of simply offering an experience of transit and waiting fraught with despair and suffering, Petzold's film opens itself up to a reading in line with Siegfried Kracauer's sustained aesthetic conceptualization of waiting and the space of “the anteroom.” This space of the anteroom conceptually resonates with Petzold's own notion of the “transit‐zone” present throughout his films. Kracauer provides the frame to contemplate the wonderous beauty and possibility to be found in the formal elements ofTransit, despite the fact that it is effectively a film about the precarity of waiting that can lead to violence and death. Close analyses of the film's mise‐en‐scène, cinematography, and sound give us access to these affirmative, even utopian, qualities of waiting and show us another side of things.","[('Olivia Landry', 'Lehigh University')]","['10.1515/9781571138736', '10.1215/9780822395287', '10.1007/s10767-014-9190-y', '10.1215/9780822394716', '10.1215/9780822376774', '10.5406/illinois/9780252037986.001.0001', '10.1080/17411548.2014.921490', '10.7312/koep16832', '10.1177/0191453710366213', '10.1525/9780520964853']",Wiley

These so-called mendicant texts challenged contemporary disability representations in both “empty sleeve” discourse and in US pension law, drawing attention to how economic structures shaped the experience of living with an impairment and to the social determinants of poverty. At the same time, mendicant texts stopped short of arguing for a wholesale reorganization of society; thus, they testify to the partial and uneven postbellum evolution in understandings of disability and poverty as social categories. If mendicant texts tell us about the historical circumstances of disability and its intersection with economic suffering, they also offer productive challenges to scholars studying life writing from the perspectives of US literary studies, disability studies, and poverty studies. While mendicant narratives’ ambiguous authorship and departures from the truth trouble expectations of authentic and resistant self-representation, these elements offer new insights into the rigid constraints upon acceptable disability presentation in this era, as well as the creative choices made by veterans who peddled literature in order to survive.","[('Jean Franzino', '')]","['10.1215/00029831-8056602', '10.1353/jnc.2015.0007', '10.1525/9780520928039', '10.5149/9780807899298_fahs', '10.1093/oso/9780190848347.001.0001', '10.1353/lm.2020.0003', '10.2307/j.ctv5npkfb', '10.1093/melus/31.3.3', '10.1353/cwh.2011.0025', '10.7208/chicago/9780226210124.001.0001', '10.7208/chicago/9780226482552.001.0001', '10.1007/s10926-020-09939-2', '10.1353/book14049', '10.7208/chicago/9780226532479.001.0001', '10.5149/northcarolina/9781469624891.001.0001', '10.18574/nyu/9780814740880.001.0001', '10.1215/10642684-9-1-2-149', '10.4159/9780674043725']",Duke University Press

10.1111/glal.12325,GERMAN LIFE AND LETTERS,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,THE 'DUNKELMaNNER' OF DOKTOR FAUSTUS: HUMANISTS VERSUS THEOLOGIANS,[],"AbstractThis essay considers the treatment of theology in Thomas Mann's novel Doktor Faustus. Specifically, it proposes theology as meeting‐point of the two opposing elements characteristic of German cultural history: humanism and fanaticism (‘the demonic’). The most significant representatives of humanism are the so‐called ‘Dunkelmänner’: the Christian humanists of the Reformation period and authors of the Epistolae obscurorum virorum. In these letters, we encounter the refined creative capacity of the human mind and spirit, in contrast to the excessive coarseness of the protestant Reformation and Martin Luther. The novel's narrator Serenus Zeitblom identifies himself particularly with Crotus Rubianus and Erasmus as representatives of both the classical and the Christian cultural world, a tradition threatened by fanaticism and violence in the twentieth century as in the sixteenth. The Epistolae arose from the burning of Jewish literature, and Mann's point is that the enfeebled German intelligentsia of the Third Reich now contains no true ‘Dunkelmänner’ – except perhaps himself. The essay also examines the sources of the theological material in the novel, both with reference to the characters in the university faculty in Halle and to the theological concepts themselves which give the novel its essential substance and are therefore necessary to its understanding.","[('Peter Eagles', 'Douglas, Isle of Man')]",[],Wiley
10.1093/melus/mlab016,MELUS,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Sula's Compromise: Toni Morrison and the Editorial Politics of Sensitivity,[],"Abstract An accomplished editor in her own right, Toni Morrison made no secret of her dissatisfaction with the editing of Sula (1973), whose opening pages she critiqued as a regrettable concession to white publishers and white readers. Yet despite Morrison’s prominence in recent studies of African American book history, scholars have yet to fully explore how the contested revisions to Sula impact the novel and what they reveal about racially motivated editing practices in mainstream US publishing. This article situates Sula’s publication history as an exemplary archive of editorial conflict, one that illuminates shifting editorial approaches to race in American fiction amid the rise of US multiculturalism. Tracing Morrison’s responses to editorial disputes about Sula and Beloved (1987), this article argues that her career indexes the emergence of racial sensitivity as an editorial concern in contemporary publishing, anticipating contemporary conflicts over formal sensitivity editing as a specialized mode of manuscript review.","[('Deborah Thurman', 'Washington University in Saint Louis, USA')]","['10.3998/mpub.12024', '10.1093/melus/mlaa032', '10.5406/illinois/9780252038433.001.0001', '10.2979/meridians.13.2.03', '10.3998/mpub.2580732', '10.2979/jmodelite.42.3.07', '10.1353/bh.2010.0014', '10.1080/09502369308582163', '10.1353/bh.2018.0011', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816674244.001.0001', '10.2307/1208913', '10.1353/nlh.1995.0059', '10.1215/10407391-6999774', '10.1386/ejac.33.2.85_1', '10.1353/aq.2016.0076', '10.1353/arq.2012.0028', '10.1017/CCOL052186111X.011']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The novel follows a father and his son who, after a devastating global disaster, move through an ashen landscape in a desperate search for food, while attempting to evade roaming bands of cannibals. In this meaningless postcatastrophic world, the father insists on creating meaning for himself and his son as meaning has been created through millennia: by telling stories. The father tells his son stories of courage and justice and creates a coherent narrative universe around the opposition between cannibalistic “bad guys” and decent “good guys” who are “carrying the fire.” The already vast reception of McCarthy's novel has discussed the father's storytelling extensively, but while critics have paid much attention to the moral and mythological dimensions of his stories, they have overlooked a crucial aspect of his narrative fabrications, namely his active construction of a linear, goal-oriented plot. Drawing on the theoretical work of Frank Kermode, Peter Brooks, and Hayden White, the article analyzes this neglected aspect of The Road and shows how the father's active plotting keeps both the story and the protagonists moving through the broken landscape.","[('Tore Rye Andersen', '')]","['10.2307/42909425', '10.3200/EXPL.67.1.11-13', '10.1353/san.2013.0010', '10.1093/alh/ajr019', '10.1353/nlh.2016.0026', '10.1353/mfs.2016.0041', '10.1017/CCO9781139087438.017', '10.5325/cormmccaj.14.1.0117', '10.1080/10436928.2012.676986', '10.2979/JML.2009.33.1.57', '10.1017/CCO9781139087438.019', '10.5250/symploke.19.1-2.0075', '10.5840/renascence200961331', '10.3366/olr.2012.0042', '10.3167/cs.2013.250206', '10.1080/0013838X.2013.815390', '10.1353/sdn.2015.0046', '10.1017/CCO9781139087438.005', '10.1353/arq.2012.0016']",The Pennsylvania State University Press
10.1093/alh/ajac180,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Stateless Regionalism and Corporate Power: Willa Cather's Public Relations Novel,[],"AbstractThis article explores American novelists’ focus on towns or counties (such as Sweet Water, Eatonville, Winesburg, Yoknapatawpha) whether real or imagined, rather than states, and what that might teach us about the novel’s understanding of political totality and democratic action. Novels about towns or counties have been typically conceptualized with the discourse of regionalism, yet that has not led to a literary critical discussion of the federalist system of individual states joined in and as one nation, and how capitalist and corporate power impacts that totality. Focusing on Willa Cather’s novel A Lost Lady (1923), this article develops the notion of “stateless regionalism.” Cather’s novel portrays a political jurisdiction’s complete subsumption by the railroad corporation. Expanding on the town’s fate, the novel portrays the danger of the corporate form—with its attendant incentives, values, and limitations—as it dominates other social, democratic, and political institutions, including municipal town life and, eventually, characters’ sense of self.Cather thus offers us stateless regionalism: the realistic feeling of a political world that does not really function like a political totality at all.","[('Lisa Siraganian', '')]","['10.1086/683054', '10.1353/arq.1999.0001', '10.5149/9780807887752_hutner', '10.1017/CHOL9780521899079.030', '10.1525/9780520406599', '10.4324/9781315394503', '10.2307/j.ctt1df4gfg.7', '10.1017/9781108563611']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Responding to Euan Roger and Sebastian Sobecki’s discoveries that the Chaumpaigne release did not address an accusation of rape, I argue that they offer Chaucer scholars a chance to transform our approaches to the poet and the subject of sexual violence. No longer burdened with assessing Chaucer’s guilt or Chaumpaigne’s victimization, we may adopt, instead, a structural approach, examining how Chaucer’s rape narratives reproduce harmful myths about women, sex, and consent that perpetuate assault.

10.1215/00358118-8007985,ROMANIC REVIEW,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Sound and Vision Bruno Latour and the Languages of Philippe de Thaon's Bestiaire,[],"AbstractAs moralized works of natural history that are simultaneously scientific and religious, medieval bestiaries combine the modes Bruno Latour terms reference [REF] and religion [REL]. Bestiaries challenge the dualisms Latour identifies as central features of Modern thinking: they foreground the mediated nature of the world, they ground their descriptions in textual traditions and religious doctrine rather than direct observation, and they represent nature as articulate rather than mute. Latour’s modes help us understand the multimodal nature of bestiaries in ways that refuse the Modern preconceptions that often determine the reception of these texts today. Bestiaries in turn expose certain Modern biases that persist in Latour’s modes of existence, most notably in the crossing of the referential and religious modes [REF•REL]. This essay explores the larger implications of this problem by focusing on the operations of the religious mode [REL] in medieval bestiaries—a mode that includes reference [REF] but does not cross with it as a separate mode. Latour’s dismantling of the Modern opposition between world and words invites a reassessment of how we conceptualize the agency of language in the modes of existence.","[('Emma Campbell', 'University of Warwick')]","['10.1017/9781787440135.004', '10.1017/CBO9781107051126', '10.1484/J.VIATOR.2.301496', '10.1484/M.TEMA-EB.3.2163', '10.7208/chicago/9780226436876.001.0001', '10.1057/pmed.2014.35', '10.1093/oso/9780199256044.001.0001', '10.3917/criti.786.0916']",Duke University Press

Although criticism credits Jonson with a compositorial role in the Quarto's production, critics continue to assess its marginalia as a defense against application, finding in Sejanus, the play, evidence of parallelography, whether it be ideologically instructional, in the mirror of princes tradition, or threateningly Republican. More benignly, they view the Quarto's bountiful margins as a scholarly pretext, a manifestation and awkward defense of Jonson's unorthodox education. Generically, they view the play as a Juvenalian satire, an imperfect tragedy, or a Machiavellian history and, sometimes, all three. As a satire, it suffers charges of application, of pointing too directly to contemporary events. As a tragedy, it fails to supply the necessary tragic error that leads to the hero's fall, not to mention the necessary hero. As a history, it takes too many liberties with the truth of argument. Editors have pared down the marginalia, setting them as footnotes or endnotes; others have relegated them to appendices; still others have abandoned then entirely. Neither critics nor editors have weighed Jonson's marginalia beside the dramatic text they inform. Reading the Quarto Sejanus as a composite of margins and center, within its bibliographical, theoretical, and literary contexts, shows it to be a learned study in emergent theories of historiography. In its innovations, the composite redresses the inefficacies of contemporary historians and editors.","[('Brock MacLeod', 'University of Victoria')]","['10.1111/j.1475-6757.1986.tb00903.x', '10.1086/391242', '10.2307/3040217', '10.2307/3043418', '10.3366/bjj.1994.1.1.7', '10.2307/3716954', '10.2307/3506267']",Edinburgh University Press

Since the writer’s creative reflections mainly refer to Gaius Julius Caesar and the rulers of the first two centuries (and the first three dynasties) of the Imperial Period, the writer’s interest in the Roman Caesars must be correlated with his assessment of Imperial Rome in the I—II centuries as the time of strengthening the sole nature of the Emperor’s power and the spread of the Imperial cult, on the one hand, and the formation of Christianity, on the other. At the same time, Dostoevsky’s attention was drawn to Attila and Romulus Augustulus, whose names are associated with the final pages of the history of the Western Roman Empire. For Dostoevsky, Not only texts authored by ancient and Christian authors, but also images of Imperial Rome in contemporary literature and journalism became the sources of associations and motifs associated with the Roman Caesars for Dostoevsky. The most important nuances of meaning were born from the comparison of ancient Roman history with the new history of Western Europe and Russia. The evolution of the subject of calligraphic notes in The Idiot is significant: in the initial drafts of the novel the emphasis was placed on the despotism and monstrosity of the Roman rulers, while the notes for the final version concentrated on the reflection of the history of Imperial Rome and its fate in the Apocalypse.","[('Ekaterina Smirnova', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University
10.1111/glal.12328,GERMAN LIFE AND LETTERS,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,QUEER ADOLESCENCE IN MaDCHEN IN UNIFORM,[],"ABSTRACTMost critics have examined Leontine Sagan's Mädchen in Uniform (1931) within one of two frameworks: either the film depicts Germany's authoritarian nature or it is a ground‐breaking work of lesbian filmmaking. This article considers an alternative possibility, namely, that the film illustrates the queerness of adolescence and society's efforts to repress it. To support this claim, it engages with the developmental theories of Charlotte Bühler (1893–1974) that circulated in the period when this film was produced. The psychologist argued that adolescent girls experience a phase of ‘Schwärmerei’, a word that evoked irrationality, an excess of emotion, and fleeting same‐sex desire. Bühler's theories naturalised heterosexuality and played down the queerness of adolescence. Accordingly, Manuela's infatuation with the teacher could be considered a phase on her path towards marriage and motherhood. This analysis of the film, however, allows us to imagine a possibility in which Manuela resists the heterosexist norms enforced by the school and follows a queer path.","[('Javier Samper Vendrell', 'University of Pennsylvania')]",[],Wiley

M. Dostoevsky gave a speech at the second meeting of the Society of Connoisseurs of Russian Literature at the Moscow Noble Assembly hall. It was immediately recognized as a social and cultural event. This episode in Dostoevsky's biography has repeatedly attracted the attention of researchers. The manuscript collection of The V. I. Dahl State Museum of the History of Russian Literature contains a significant set of materials related to Dostoevsky’s participation in the Pushkin Celebration. In the process of collecting materials for the Memorial Museum of F. M. Dostoevsky, A. G. Dostoevskaya, the writer’s widow conducted thorough bibliographic work, tracing almost all available publications in the Russian press devoted to Pushkin speech. She made extensive extracts from newspapers, which allow you to see the event through the eyes of Russian reporters. As the analysis shows, only minor fragments of newspaper reports were of interest to Dostoevsky's biographers. The characteristic of the responses of the Russian press to Pushkin speech as a major public event, presented in this article, allows to expand the context of Dostoevsky's speech and offer a more detailed overview of the audience of Pushkin speech. An observation is made about the similarity of the event associated with Dostoevsky's speech with his optimistic anthropology, formulated in the article Golden age in the pocket (1876, A Writer’s Diary). The presented systematic corpus of publications rooted in the Pushkin speech, allows us to conclude that the speech itself became the most important information event of 1880 as a social and cultural event and literary and journalistic essay. The Appendix to the article contains photos of some materials from the Manuscript Fund of the Vladimir Dahl State Museum of the History of Russian Literature.","[('Pavel E. Fokin', ''), ('Anna V.

By comparing it to Von den natürlichen Dingen, another treatise that overlaps extensively with the Herbarius (four of the six Gewechse discussed in the Herbarius are also dealt with in Von den natürlichen Dingen), the article suggests that both texts, although unfinished, must be read as well-crafted treatises rather than mere drafts. It also examines two hypotheses concerning the relationship between the two treatises: the Herbarius will alternatively be read as a simplified version of Von den natürlichen Dingen, written concomitantly in order to be understandable by the “common man” (gemeine Mann); and as its preliminary version, further elaborated upon by Paracelsus several years after he wrote the Herbarius. By tracing the early reception of the Herbarius, the article attempts to understand its relationship to the several writings that were deemed by the followers of Paracelsus to be part of a supposedly larger Paracelsian herbal centered on the doctrine of signatures: to them, the Herbarius was undoubtedly a mere excerpt of Paracelsus’ Herbarius spiritualis sidereus, a concept investigated here.","[('Matti Leprêtre', 'Centre de recherche médecine, sciences, santé, santé mentale, société (Cermes3/CAK), L’École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) Paris Frankreich')]",[],Walter de Gruyter GmbH

The scope and directionality of such extensions are remarkably consistent, and are indicative of a change driven by the structure of the inflectional paradigm in the relevant varieties. A significant consequence of this development, which fits into a general Romance tendency for analogical remodelling of first and second person plural forms, is alignment between previously overlapping distributions of stem allomorphs and stress placement, and thus greater predictability of inflected forms.","[('Louise Esher', 'CNRS (LLACAN, UMR 8135)')]","['10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199547548.003.0003', '10.1111/j.1749-818X.2007.00024.x', '10.1017/CBO9780511486234', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199593545.001.0001', '10.3406/lgge.2003.2441', '10.1353/lan.2007.0006', '10.3366/word.2014.0064', '10.1075/dia.32.4.02esh', '10.1075/rro.51.2.09esh', '10.1093/oso/9780198840176.003.0017', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199589982.003.0014', '10.1075/la.186.03hin', '10.1075/cilt.326.14jug', '10.1017/S0022226700014432', '10.3828/bhs.78.4.441', '10.1007/1-4020-2900-4_6', '10.4000/rlv.1765', '10.1515/zrph.2009.022', '10.1075/la.186.02mai', '10.1075/dia.30.4.03mai', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199677108.003.0043', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198702108.003.0003', '10.1093/oso/9780199660216.003.0002', '10.1007/s11525-009-9135-8', '10.1007/s11525-014-9232-1', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198723769.003.0003', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199678860.003.0013', '10.1017/CBO9781316105290', '10.1017/CBO9781139248860', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199589982.003.0010', '10.4324/9780203300275']",John Benjamins Publishing Company

However, the amount of information available about such aspects is imposing, and its location subject to the extreme dispersion of traditional scholarly publications: commentaries first but also academic journals, miscellanies, and so forth. Rather than being based on traditional word searches, a true advancement of knowledge needs to overcome the rigidity of text-based queries (and in-line markup embedded in text). Such paramount evolution is now made possible by the Semantic Web, an extension of the current web by description standards that help machines to understand and connect the information already available on the web. To achieve this, the latter is mapped using formal description and classification patterns, called ontologies. Ontologies are a key factor in managing meaningful search/data extraction, publishing relevant results on the web, search existing web resources, and offering answers to more sophisticated queries. Due to its vastness and complexity, Dante scholarship has calls for an ontology-based mapping, and specific tools have been designed to express the most difficult and articulate aspects of Dante’s literary production, such as its use of biblical, classical, and medieval sources. This paper aims to introduce the aims and scope of a new digital library of Dante commentaries, built according to the aforementioned standards and aiming to refine and extend the ontologies developed for Dante’s minor works to the more complex world of the Commedia.","[('Carlo Meghini', 'CNR-ISTI (Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell’Informazione) “A.

My analysis centers on the work of two modern poets, who although they see themselves belonging to the oral tradition, compose their poetry in writing. Their poetry is, therefore, characterized by use of two different, and, to some degree, opposite modes of language – the oral and the written. This is especially interesting in the context of the Arabic language, where, officially, only Standard Arabic exists in two modes – oral and written, while its dialectal varieties are seen as exclusively oral forms of communication and ‘vulgar’ poetry. The textual analysis will be substantiated by information received directly from both poets. To complement this analysis I examine this tradition through the lens of major cultural and identity changes occurring in local Moroccan genres and traditions at the national level and argue that the oral tradition of the Jbala is converging with the more popular and prestigious tradition of the malhun.","[('Sarali Gintsburg', '')]",[],Universidad de Navarra
10.1093/alh/ajaa031,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Literary Genealogies and the Kinship of Black Modernity,[],"Abstract This brief essay is a reflection on the genealogical as a metaphor for modernity’s teleologies. Considering genealogy not as a biological lineage but as a network of kinship relations, we can better understand the collective—and often teleologically recursive—means by which modernity is imagined and reimagined. Understood via this metaphor of relation, we can see how modernity is not simply a progressive line of descendancy, but a complex web of influence. Our methodologies for tracing modernity’s genealogies must therefore think beyond what is inevitable and toward the deliberate and multiplicitous practices contributing to its reproduction. These methodologies must often follow circuitous routes that defy normative disciplinary taxonomies and frameworks. Moreover, the process of tracing modernity’s genealogies is ongoing, perpetuated always to the present moment as its study is also a mechanism for its perpetual reproduction. Black genealogical reproduction is an involved process in modernity, encompassing mechanisms from the bodily to the aesthetic to the technological, resisting normalized teleologies of descent, and extending its branches into complex webs that emerge within Black futures and help to produce them.","[('Brigitte Fielder', '')]","['10.1093/alh/ajaa023', '10.1093/alh/ajaa028', '10.1093/alh/ajaa032', '10.1093/alh/ajaa033', '10.1093/alh/ajaa024']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Kandice Chuh argues that diversity management in the field of “American Literature” has led to the segregation of minoritized literatures from dominant literatures under a pernicious logic which distinguishes between aesthetics and politics, reserving the former for white literature and the latter for minoritized literatures. In practice, the distinction between aesthetics and politics is also a distinction between history and identity that makes it possible for racialized subjects to appear in the present wholly formed and wholly subordinate. I argue that Latinx historicism—my shorthand for recent work foregrounding the contingency of Latinx literary histories—offers an urgent corrective to this constrained historical imagination.","[('John Alba Cutler', '')]","['10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199729722.001.0001', '10.2307/j.ctv11hpp7d']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Exemplum XI is one of the best known and most celebrated stories in the book for its seemingly preternatural turn in the plot’s action and the characters’ visit to the Other World. The article seeks to identify Don Yllán with Archbishop Julian of Toledo (642‒690), author of the Prognosticon futuri saeculi (687), an important theological tract that circulated widely during the Middle Ages and that served as the basis for the doctrine of Purgatory. The Prognosticon contains illustrative anecdotes of dialogs with the dead and journeys to and from the Other World. As such, it endowed Julian with the legendary reputation of necromancer and probably served as inspiration for Don Juan Manuel’s Exemplum XI of El Conde Lucanor.","[('E.

In L’Intrus (2000), Nancy describes how undergoing a heart transplant led him to encounter the intrinsic strangeness and multiplicity of his body and identity. This text, it will be seen, explores also the spatialization of this strangeness and multiplicity; Nancy characterizes the transplant as an ‘intrusion’ and details the extension of his body and being across a network of medical treatments and technologies. This article brings L’Intrus into dialogue with approaches to hospital environments in the medical humanities, as well as with Nancy's interrogation of conceptions of construction, destruction, and ‘struction’ in Dans quels mondes vivons-nous?

Reversing the formulation identified by Sean McCann and Michael Szalay in their 2005 essay “Do You Believe in Magic? Literary Thinking After the New Left,” in which an earlier generation of left-leaning American writers eschewed engagement with the state in favor of imagining utopian magical communities, these novels rewrite historical events, often catastrophic and violent ones, with the addition of one piece of working magical infrastructure. Here we explore the effects of these magical technological additions in three novels: Colson Whitehead’s Underground Railroad (2016); Mohsin Hamid’s Exit West (2017); and briefly, César Aira’s Shantytown (2000). Although these effects vary, in these novels, history continues on as violently as ever: together they betray the difficulty in late neoliberalism of even imagining that states will provide working infrastructure, particularly for oppressed and displaced people. At the same time, these novels challenge the idea that imagining utopian communities beyond the state’s orbit constitutes a retreat from politics. Rather, they showcase the difficult, painstaking work of building alternative community in the wake of the state’s many failures and imply the continued necessity of confronting and reimagining the violent state rather than appealing to it.","[('Molly Geidel', ''), ('Patricia Stuelke', '')]","['10.1177/0263775816645989', '10.14321/crnewcentrevi.18.1.0105', '10.4159/9780674495548', '10.2307/j.ctv16756nq', '10.1093/alh/ajz056', '10.2307/j.ctv17vf68f', '10.5325/utopianstudies.30.1.0087', '10.18574/nyu/9781479829590.001.0001', '10.2979/meridians.12.2.142', '10.1080/10999949.2016.1162596', '10.1215/-12-2-1', '10.7208/chicago/9780226653488.001.0001', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816679270.001.0001', '10.1353/yale.2006.0010', '10.9783/9780812206371', '10.1353/arq.2017.0017', '10.1215/9780822373421', '10.1215/01903659-2006-025', '10.1093/alh/ajr026', '10.1215/9781478007401', '10.2307/464747', '10.7551/mitpress/10905.001.0001']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

This article tells the story of Jacobs’s and Whitman’s intersecting journeys to and from Thayer and Eldridge, and considers what this convergence can teach us about the antebellum book market and our scholarly evaluations of it. The first section of the article illuminates the publishing histories of Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861) by Jacobs and the third edition of Leaves of Grass by Whitman (1860) from the vantage of Thayer and Eldridge, their shared publisher. Thanks to the vast economic support of Thayer and Eldridge, Whitman brought his artistic vision into the literary marketplace, but he did so at the expense of Jacobs. Thayer and Eldridge went bankrupt printing and promoting Whitman’s book, leaving Jacobs without a publisher. Jacobs, in turn, published Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by herself. The article’s second section leaves Whitman and Thayer and Eldridge behind to follow Jacobs on her postpublication book tour. Her efforts in these years—traveling from place to place, meeting with readers, and selling her books—are the reason we have Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl today.","[('Christy L.

10.1075/rro.19001.jac,REVUE ROMANE,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,How 'Portuguese' are Palenquero and Chabacano really?,[],"AbstractA long-lasting debate within creole studies concerns the scarcity of Spanish-based creoles and the theoretical implications this may have. However, there is no agreement as to how many genuinely Spanish-based creoles there are in the world, and identifying the size of that group can generate controversies. Papiamentu, for instance, is canonically classified as a Spanish-based creole, even though most scholars at present seem to agree its origins are Creole Portuguese. A Portuguese lineage has on various occasions and by various authors also been claimed for Chabacano (Philippine Creole Spanish) and Palenquero (spoken in Colombia). These creoles, too, were supposedly once Portuguese-based, only to subsequently be ‘relexified’ towards Spanish. This paper argues that there is little linguistic basis for that claim. Although both creoles do indeed seem to have received some Portuguese (Creole) input, we maintain that this input was limited and substratal in nature, and thus has no bearing on the classification (whether diachronic or synchronic) of the two creoles as truly Spanish-based.","[('Bart Jacobs', 'Jagiellonian University'), ('Mikael Parkvall', 'Stockholm University')]","['10.4312/ala.4.2.67-84', '10.1075/jpcl.26.1.02bak', '10.56551/UAHL8045', '10.31819/9783865278906-011', '10.1515/9783110960228.35', '10.1016/0024-3841(70)90080-X', '10.1093/ahr/120.2.433', '10.1007/s10831-011-9078-z', '10.1017/CBO9780511576171', '10.1002/9781118228098.ch2', '10.1093/oso/9780199254125.001.0001', '10.1515/9783110960228.149', '10.31819/9783865279002-022', '10.1515/9783110300031.559', '10.2307/jj.7079906.6', '10.1515/9783110960228.43', '10.1075/tsl.95.18gra', '10.1075/tsl.87.09hag', '10.1075/jpcl.26.1.05hag', '10.1017/CBO9780511613463', '10.1515/9781614511076', '10.1002/9781118228098.ch13', '10.1163/9789004271319_003', '10.1075/jpcl.31.1.06li', '10.1017/S0047404500012136', '10.1515/zrph.1988.104.1-2.25', '10.1016/0388-0001(92)90005-Y', '10.1017/CBO9780511627811', '10.31819/9783865279026', '10.1515/9783110848649.407', '10.3917/ling.411.0057', '10.1075/jpcl.10.2.04mcw', '10.1525/9780520923492', '10.1016/B978-0-12-107450-0.50014-0', '10.1515/9783110960228', '10.22380/20274688.703', '10.1075/slcs.94.17par', '10.1017/CBO9781139164566', '10.1017/CBO9780511992827', '10.1016/j.lingua.2018.09.006', '10.2307/2716599', '10.1075/cilt.91.14por', '10.1515/9783110960228.21', '10.1075/cll.33.15rub', '10.31819/9783865278838-007', '10.1075/dia.19.2.03sch', '10.1075/cll.31.11sch', '10.1515/shll-2010-1082', '10.1075/coll.54.02sch', '10.1075/coll.55.12sch', '10.1075/coll.54', '10.1163/179325409X434487', '10.1515/9783110207231.2.203', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199764136.013.0022', '10.1017/S0021853711000119']",John Benjamins Publishing Company

10.1111/glal.12310,GERMAN LIFE AND LETTERS,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,HUMBOLDT IN VENEZUELA AND CUBA: THE 'SECOND SLAVERY',[],"ABSTRACTThe reception of Humboldt's work now spans more than 200 years. It began with the publication of the texts that form his Opus Americanum (1808–31). Among these works, it was in the Political Essay on Cuba, where a chapter was devoted to the demography of the slave trade from Africa to Cuba, that became a cornerstone of the global historical significance of Humboldt's oeuvre. It can be argued that during the past 200 years the same clichés and slogans of liberal abolitionism (or its opponents, such as J. S. Thrasher) have been heard over and over again, without researchers having taken the trouble to investigate the biographical‐historical and micro‐historical origins of Humboldt's attitude to slavery, the slave trade and its sources. This article aims to show what Humboldt really could (and wanted to) know about slavery and the slave trade, by means of a micro‐distance and a micro‐point, the 25‐day crossing from Nueva Barcelona, in present‐day Venezuela, to Havana in Cuba in November/December 1800, as well as Humboldt's stay at the home of slave trader, Don Juan Luis de la Cuesta, in Havana (1800/1 and 1804). Die Humboldt‐Rezeption umfasst ca. 200 Jahre. Sie begann mit den Publikationen der Werke des Opus Americanum (1808–31). In Bezug auf eines dieser Werke, den Politischen Essay über die Insel Kuba, steht fest, dass die Demografie des Sklavenhandels von Afrika nach Kuba (und in der Karibik) sowie das Kapitel ʻÜber das Sklavenwesenʼ Eckpunkte oder auch Säulen der globalhistorischen Bedeutung des humboldtschen Werkes darstellen. In der Rezeption von Humboldts Werk, und vor allem dieser Eckpunkte/Säulen sind über 200 Jahre eigentlich immer wieder die gleichen Klischees und Fahnenworte des liberalen Abolitionismus benutzt worden (oder seiner Gegner, wie J. S. Thrasher), ohne dass sich Rezipienten die Mühe gemacht hätten, die lebensgeschichtliche und mikrohistorische Entstehung der Haltung Humboldts zu Sklaverei und Sklavenhandel und seine Quellen zu erforschen. Der Beitrag will an einer Mikrostrecke und einem Mikropunkt, der 25‐tägigen Überfahrt von Nueva Barcelona im heutigen Venezuela nach Havanna auf Kuba im November/Dezember 1800 und Humboldts Beherbergung durch den Sklavenhändler Don Juan Luis de la Cuesta in Havanna (1800/1 und 1804), zeigen, was Humboldt realhistorisch zu Sklaverei und Sklavenhandel wissen konnte (und wollte).","[('Michael Zeuske', 'Centre for Dependency and Slavery Studies, Rheinische Friedrich‐Wilhelms‐Universität Bonn')]",[],Wiley

The object of consideration was the generation of the grandchildren of the grandfather of the writer Fyodor Timofeevich Nechaev: the Dostoevskys (the children of Maria, his daughter from his first marriage), the Shers and the Stavrovskys (the children of the daughters of F. T. Nechaev from his second marriage — Olga and Ekaterina). Biographical data about the relatives and cousins of F. M. Dostoevsky were extracted from parish and consistory metric books stored in the Central State Archive of the City of Moscow. With a few exceptions (Mikhail, Andrey), metric records of the birth of the writer's siblings are being introduced into scientific circulation for the first time; in some cases, archival documents allowed correcting inaccuracies that were present in the biographical literature about Dostoevsky. Of the thirteen Sher brothers and sisters, male and female cousins of the writer, the names of seven were not previously mentioned even in the fundamental “Chronicle of the Generations of Dostoevskys” (2012). Of the seven Stavrovsky brothers and sisters, two were also named for the first time. Metric birth records are provided for all twenty of these relatives of Dostoevsky; for those who died in infancy, there are also death records. In four cases, the article published metric records of the wedding of the writer’s male and female cousins. In conclusion, the importance of biographical information about the Shers and the Stavrovskys is emphasized for the study of such an important event in the life of F. M. Dostoevsky in the 1870s, as was the litigation over the inheritance of A. F. Kumanina, the writer's mother's sister and half-sister of Olga Sher and Ekaterina Stavrovskaya (the so-called “the Kumanin heritage case”).","[('Inga Drobyshevskaya', ''), ('Boris Tikhomirov', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University

I juxtapose the modes of reference [REF] and fiction [FIC] with a famous digression reflecting on historiographical practice in William of Malmesbury’s Gesta regum Anglorum. AIME offers analytical rigor to medievalists’ discussions of the notorious overlap between “history” and “fiction.” William’s bold use of [FIC] to advance [REF] is in the spirit of AIME’s project, though he goes further in trusting [FIC] than AIME is always willing to do. An instance of medieval historiography thus leads the way in overcoming a residual Modern suspicion of a nonreferential mode of existence and of knowledge. Additionally, although AIME’s restriction of crossings to two modes is useful for defining each, in practice more than two are often found “plaited.” I make this argument through a discussion of the use of brackets to mark verse form and rhyme scheme in medieval manuscripts: an example of [TEC•FIC•REF] plaiting. Finally, I call for further development of the multimodal possibilities of “form,” which AIME flags but does not pursue, and for a new mode of existence to be added to Latour’s list: [FOR].","[('Jane Gilbert', 'University College London')]","['10.5325/chaucerrev.47.4.0416', '10.1017/tdo.2017.8', '10.1515/9781501779954', '10.2307/j.ctvd58s97.20', '10.1515/9781846156090', '10.1093/fmls/cqi020', '10.1515/9781846158643']",Duke University Press

According to many of the people who lived through it, enslaved childhood was a shifting, episodic phenomenon that had multiple points of definition. Throughout the nineteenth century, as their adult selves looked back on their early years, formerly enslaved people adopted a number of different strategies to understand and narrate how they came to be who they were and what their formative experiences meant in terms of the trajectory of their lives. They wrote within a literary culture that was itself partially responsible for creating (and certainly was instrumental in promoting and perpetuating) the temporal understanding of childhood as unidirectional, progressive, and only tangentially connected to material reality. But they also described quite different temporal patterns for slave childhood. These patterns are the focus of my analysis here: how African American narrators negotiated their vexed relationship to childhood as both never- and always-children in order to challenge the growing consensus on how childhood could and should be staged in literary texts. My primary sources are narratives by formerly enslaved people, written, as most slave narratives were, primarily but not exclusively for white readers.","[('Sarah E.

10.1093/alh/ajaa008,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"Economic Imperception; or, Reading Capital on the Beach with Thoreau",[],"AbstractThis essay argues that throughout his oeuvre, Henry David Thoreau develops a theory of sensory perception that comes to its literary culmination in Cape Cod (1865). I argue that Thoreau’s thinking on the senses demonstrates that the senses are a product of historical development. In Cape Cod, Thoreau is particularly interested in how economic interest has trained the senses to become structurally incapable of sensing the death that is a necessary part of the commodity form and social life in general—similar to what Karl Marx in Capital (1867) would describe as “dead labor.” This essay explores how in Cape Cod, Thoreau offers his reader a method of reading that seeks to make legible through literary form—specifically through puns, metaphor, and juxtaposition—the point at which the senses fail. Thoreau’s method in Cape Cod therefore differs from his more well-known works such as Walden (1854), where he only explicitly tells his readers about that to which they are blind. Ultimately, I claim that Thoreau’s political message throughout his career remains much the same, but the way in which he mobilizes literary form to convey that message marks an important change in how we might make sense of—and make sensible—political economy.","[('Alex Moskowitz', '')]","['10.4159/9780674495364', '10.1017/CBO9781316146002.005', '10.1017/CCOL0521440378.011', '10.12987/9780300156935', '10.1093/oseo/instance.00042831', '10.7208/chicago/9780226344720.001.0001']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Scholars have located existentialist strains in McCarthy's literature, but this article offers a new reading of Anton Chigurh's role as an embodiment of both death and the search for authentic existence. Working against the critical consensus that Chigurh's dialogues with his victims are grounded on a desire to provoke them to a deeper understanding of their situations, I argue that Chigurh is actually trying to bring about an existentialist understanding of death for himself. In Heidegger's Being and Time, such an understanding involves breaking free of societal views that treat death as a threat consigned to a distant future and embracing mortality as a possibility that is at once certain, indefinite, and intrinsic to one's existence.","[('Gregory Phipps', '')]","['10.5325/cormmccaj.14.1.0078', '10.1353/ctn.2013.0009', '10.2307/j.ctv47wd2c', '10.5325/cormmccaj.14.1.0055', '10.5325/cormmccaj.15.2.0128', '10.5325/cormmccaj.14.2.0168', '10.2307/j.ctv6wght8', '10.2307/302786', '10.1057/9780230617841', '10.1353/cli.0.0092', '10.5325/cormmccaj.15.2.0152', '10.5325/cormmccaj.15.1.0046', '10.1353/arq.2014.0016', '10.1007/s10746-015-9341-9', '10.51644/9780889205567']",The Pennsylvania State University Press

While Sedgwick’s essay is routinely cited for its endorsement of reparative reading practices, I argue that her call is not to abandon suspicion, but to engage in a similar movement, or “oscillation,” between the exhaustive alertness of paranoia and the small, but sustaining, world-building practices she associates with the “depressive” position. In the second part of the essay, I turn to Ling Ma’s debut novel Severance (2018) as a literary text that hones this critical movement and, more particularly, invites us to think the value of routine, repetition, and drifting as something other and more complex than the erasure of agency.","[('Eva Cherniavsky', '')]","['10.1525/rep.2009.108.1.1', '10.1353/nlh.2011.0045', '10.1177/016344378000200106', '10.1086/421123']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

While most eighteenth- and nineteenth-century fiction deploys miniature portraits to mediate social ties and signal emotional connection, in “Le Mulâtre” the carrying of a miniature departs from this trope, marking alienation, not affiliation. Reading Séjour’s text against popular depictions and material histories of ivory portrait miniatures, I demonstrate that these familiar objects of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century life function not merely as emblems of intimacy, as past scholars have argued, but rather as tools of what Elizabeth Maddock Dillon calls “intimate distance”—a social configuration that depends on asserting closeness with geographically distributed white populations while disavowing intimacy with physically present Black and Indigenous peoples. Although the portrait is said to depict Georges’s father, who readers know is also the man’s white enslaver, the object remains hidden from view in a bag until the final moments of the sketch, which concludes with the father’s beheading and the son’s suicide. I argue that by emplotting the miniature in a moment of bloodshed rather than of sentiment, Séjour registers the affective and material violence that undergirds white colonial definitions of the family, and invites broader critical comparison of the ways that both sentimental and colonial structures depend on racialized distributions of affections. In the concluding portion of this essay, I turn to the “little buckskin pouch” containing Alfred’s miniature and consider how its resemblance to Afro-Atlantic folk charms recasts the racialized binaries traditionally advanced by miniature portraits. Viewed as part of a charm, the portrait underscores that whiteness is a ritualized notion dependent on material signifiers.","[('Madeline Zehnder', '')]","['10.1525/9780520312197', '10.5040/9798400666322', '10.9783/9780812208733.21', '10.1057/9781137022691', '10.1080/08905490208583553', '10.4324/9781315554150', '10.1017/CBO9780511485701', '10.1080/14788810.2015.1026110', '10.18574/nyu/9781479817221.001.0001', '10.1111/1754-0208.12467', '10.1525/ncl.2010.65.1.1', '10.5949/liverpool/9781781381847.001.0001', '10.1215/9780822395737', '10.1353/book.20574', '10.1162/TNEQ_a_00527', '10.1215/00161071-2294883', '10.18574/nyu/9781479829590.001.0001', '10.1215/10642684-3750437', '10.7202/1069665ar', '10.1215/00029831-1901418', '10.9783/9780812292954', '10.2307/3177190', '10.1111/j.0141-6790.2004.00438.x', '10.1353/ecf.0.0055', '10.2307/1499774', '10.1080/07399330290107304', '10.7591/9781501729935', '10.1007/978-1-4939-2633-6_3']",Duke University Press

These later revisions not only link the passage to Melville’s earlier Liverpool recollection of the African sailor as a Black avatar of the Handsome Sailor type, but they also broaden Billy’s condition to embrace all “fervid hearts,” including Melville’s self-containment in his “inside narrative” of Billy’s lethal anger.","[('John Bryant', '')]",[],Project MUSE

How will climate change, one of, if not the most pressing issue of our times be tackled on a global scale? With these questions in mind, this article invites the reader to perform a thought experiment into the future. Following an imagined snapshot of the year 2040, the reader is guided through major global developments regarding climate change, social movements and, eventually, climate justice from the 2020s to 2040s. By imagining social, political and economic consequences of climate change and responses to them, this article paints a picture of what the future could look like if climate justice became a guiding principle in the struggle of mitigating the effects of climate change. Suggesting a paradigm shift from securitizing climate change to securing climate justice, this ‘future’ calls for a discursive turn of the manner in which climate change is thought of and acted upon. It requires different entities, including academia, to recognize their role as political actors within society. Consequently, it is crucial to reflect upon whose security is (not) considered but also which responses are taken into account in what way to mitigate security risks related to climate change. The article concludes that imagining a future of climate justice is pivotal to finding solutions to the challenges we are confronted with, that is, keeping the metaphoric ship from crashing into the cliffs.","[('Madita Standke-Erdmann', 'University of Vienna, Austria'), ('Alina Viehoff', 'Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg (IFSH), Germany')]","['10.1080/01436597.2017.1375379', '10.1038/s41558-018-0068-2', '10.1093/isq/sqx048', '10.1017/S0892679418000059', '10.4324/9781315749228', '10.2305/IUCN.CH.2020.03.en', '10.1215/9780822375265', '10.1057/dev.2011.86', '10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.09.014', '10.4324/9781315537689', '10.4324/9781315162935-18', '10.1007/978-1-349-19059-1_20', '10.1080/21624887.2019.1644050', '10.4324/9781315671468-1', '10.1590/1809-4422asocex0003v2022017']",SAGE Publications

It offers an analysis of Walther's two most important texts, Ein Beitrag zur Ontologie der sozialen Gemeinschaften (1922) and Zur Phänomenologie der Mystik (1923), written during Walther's involvement in the Freiburg and Munich circles of early phenomenologists. Analysis of these texts reveals a compelling, non‐discursive philosophical methodology in which mystical essences unfold as social and historical realities, rather than some ideal standing behind or beyond materiality. Walther offers a pragmatic and poetic vision of language that is inadequate in a representational sense, yet still capable of guiding us to philosophical redemption. In quoting the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke, she displays a complex interrelation between poetic and philosophical language in her work. This article argues for a significant re‐orientation of emerging scholarship on Walther, with a focus on her language and textual strategies. It positions her work in terms of recent developments in scholarship around the connections between phenomenology and modernist literature.","[('Niamh Burns', 'University of Oxford')]",[],Wiley

Chaucer’s contemporaries wrote more elaborate petitions than this one in their own hands, so the burden of proof lies with those who wish to claim that this petition is the work of a professional scribe.","[('Richard Firth Green', 'The Ohio State University Columbus, Ohio (green.693@osu.edu)')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

While studies that privilege the reactions of Oklahomans and Californians have perpetuated a narrative of negative attitudes toward The Grapes of Wrath, the archive of the F.S.A. labor camp newspapers undermines the accuracy of this narrative insofar as it extends to the migrants in the government camps. Within these newspapers, migrants enthusiastically reported on several topics related to Steinbeck's activities in the late 1930s and early 1940s, such as the Steinbeck Committee to Aid Agricultural Organization, The Grapes of Wrath novel, and the novel's adaptation into film. Regarding these overlapping topics, migrants in the F.S.A. labor camp newspapers expressed gratitude, published reviews, formed discussion groups, and defended the story from outside attacks.","[('Christopher Bowman', '')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

I posit that the affective condition of shame is both a result of and intrinsic to the social formation of queer and refugee identities. I also trace how these identities that at times can exclude the Other also intersect in On Earth as a way of revealing and critiquing the parallel forms of heteropatriarchal violence enacted upon the queer/refugee subject. Through Vuong’s presentation of Little Dog’s queer Vietnamese identity, I consider how Little Dog must reconcile himself to the loyalties that bind him to his matrilineal family and Vietnam and also to American idealizations of white masculinity and heterosexuality. These tensions are animated through the shame resulting from Little Dog’s sexual encounters with his white American love interest, Trevor, and in Little Dog and his family’s social “failures” to integrate into the United States and become model minorities. The sustained incompatibility between the matrilineal past of Vietnam (and the metonymic war the country signifies) and the American present belonging to the white fathers who fill the text also shows the limits of the dominant narratives that situate the United States in benevolent relation to the powerless refugees it saved and rehomed. Although I focus on the paralyzing effects of shame that attend experiences of racial and sexual difference, I explore how Vuong reimagines shame as a generative site that not only creates new intimacies and grammars across bodies that have been deemed socially abject but also conjures a Vietnam outside the familiar US war narrative of rescue.","[('Jennifer Cho', 'Boston University , USA')]","['10.1515/9780748691142', '10.1353/book.20656', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816674435.001.0001', '10.2307/j.ctv11smqsk', '10.1353/rmr.2021.0033', '10.1215/03335372-2007-019', '10.5325/jspecphil.29.3.0415', '10.1093/melus/mlw021', '10.1353/jlt.2018.0003', '10.1353/wsq.2019.0020', '10.1515/ang-2020-0023', '10.1353/wsq.2020.0026', '10.5749/CES.0601.nguyen', '10.1215/01642472-7371003', '10.18574/nyu/9781479804733.001.0001', '10.23943/princeton/9780691157825.001.0001']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

To understand how Gurnah engages productively with his intertexts, this paper draws on work by Judith Butler to characterise Western canonical literature as frames, as well as Ankhi Mukherjee’s description of canonicity. What becomes apparent in my examination of the selected works is a trajectory in Gurnah’s authorial project from the simple rejection of frames towards new representations of refugees and marginalised migrants as fully ethical agents rather than emblematic victims. Thus, Gurnah’s work could be read as an exemplar of the narrative recalibration of the representation of migrants called for by scholars such as Loren B.

Du Bois",[],"AbstractQuantification has long played a vexed role in efforts to record and resist racial violence. Building from Ida B. Wells’s antilynching crusade, this essay examines the risks and power of calculating life and death at the close of the nineteenth century. For her part, Wells pushed mere counting past itself to a profound mode of ethical accounting. Two of her contemporaries, Mark Twain and W. E. B. Du Bois, sustained a similarly supraquantitative thrust; each attempted to harness the antilynching potential of numbers by enlisting data visualization. Twain falls short in a telling fashion, as his unpublished satire “The United States of Lyncherdom” (written in 1901) exacerbates the dehumanizing tendencies of quantification. Du Bois, however, pursues a more generative experiment, creating statistical graphics in 1900 that indict and outstrip the causal circuit that yoked scientific numbering to lynching and racial violence more broadly.

It contains the notes made by Anna Dostoevskaya for herself about her late husband within a few months after his death, according to the most recent memories of him. On paper, using shorthand signs in some cases, she recorded joint purchases, gifts received from her husband, his characteristic words, habits, tastes, manner of bearing, dressing, reciting aloud, peculiarities of eating, conversation, creative work (including the January issue of “A Writer’s Diary,” published after Dostoevsky’s death), recorded information related to the writer’s childhood years spent in Moscow, as well as the last days and hours of his life, the details of the funeral and funeral service, the children’s memories of their father. These recordings have already been published, but not in full and in violation of the sequence. Despite their fragmentary nature, unformulated into processed memories, and chaotic arrangement, they have their own composition and logic. The memoirist structures the farewell text with a dear person who continues to live in her memory in a specific way: she opens the entries with sketches of the writer’s plans for the next 10 years, and concludes with a dialogue about children as successors of the Dostoevsky family. Memories of the writer are not the only materials in the composition of Anna Dostoevskaya’s notebook. It also includes other documents of historical and literary value (bills, receipts, receipts, address records, letters, a newspaper clipping with an obituary about Doctor of Medicine Ivan Verevkin, etc.), a comprehensive review of which is presented for the first time in this article. In the course of the study, corrections were made to the previously transcribed text of Anna Dostoevskaya’s transcripts (by the Leningrad stenographer Ceciliia Poshemanskaya), errors in the manuscript rendition made in previous publications of this document were corrected. In the Appendix to the article, memoirs from Anna Dostoevskaya’s notebook of 1881 are published in full, accompanied by historical and literary commentaries based on the latest achievements of the study of Dostoevsky’s work.","[('Irina Andrianova', ''), ('Boris Tikhomirov', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University

10.1093/alh/ajz048,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Willy Loman and Postwar Jewish Insecurity,[],"Abstract Willy Loman’s cryptic Jewish identity, recognizable but absent, has long been considered an act of ethnic betrayal, evidence of Arthur Miller’s inauthenticity as a Jewish writer. However, as scholars recently have explored the undercurrent of anxiety running beneath the surface of postwar Jewish life, Willy’s feelings of rootlessness, and his worries over American success, seem now particularly “Jewish.” Arguing that Willy Loman represents a postwar Jewish-American identity crisis, not a suppressed Jewish essence, the article analyzes the reception of Death of a Salesman (1949) in the Jewish press, from the pulpit, and within the synagogue community. Throughout, Willy’s preoccupation with acceptance and his eventual self-destruction resonate uncomfortably with the nightmare of European catastrophe that American Jews were then processing. In this context, the article claims that Biff’s attempt to counter his father’s world of selling by laboring in Texas, an action usually interpreted through myths of the American West, may have been read by Jewish Salesman audiences through a discourse of postwar Zionism they knew well: namely, the resettlement of Holocaust refugees in the land of Israel.","[('Mark Hodin', '')]","['10.3998/mpub.147187', '10.2979/JSS.2006.12.3.95', '10.1525/rac.2002.12.1.31', '10.4159/9780674989917', '10.5149/northcarolina/9781469635439.001.0001']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Chaucer thereby explores how masculine sympathy for the good wife appropriates the structures of feeling at work in conduct texts in order to forge new associations between men as disparate as Arveragus, Aurelius, and the clerk of Orléans. But Chaucer also encourages us to linger and continue to feel alongside Dorigen, and as a result to feel the emotional costs women must bear to make such feminine virtue and masculine sympathy possible.","[('Glenn D.

10.1093/alh/ajaa043,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"White Slave Fiction, So-Called",[],"AbstractIn the early twentieth century, the widespread belief that young white women were at risk of being captured and forced into sex work led to significant legislative victories, and this crisis also shaped US literature in surprising ways. When writing about so-called white slavery crossed over from the spheres of journalism, social reform, and the law into fiction, authors devised a suite of quasi-empirical literary techniques that turned the dubious facts of white slavery into the stuff of popular art. Novelists drew heavily on juridical and social scientific evidence to lend authority and specificity to stories that they insisted (counterfactually) were gravely true. White slavery fiction marries empiricism with sensationalism, data with melodrama, cold statistics with exaggeration and falsehood. This essay examines the literary empiricism of Reginald Wright Kauffman’s 1910 novel The House of Bondage and the amateur literary criticism of progressive anti-vice reformers to examine a tradition of mutual borrowing between nonfictional genres such as the report, tract, and newsletter and modern US fiction. An analogy between slavery and forced sex work was pivotal to the social critique that white slavery novels existed to forward. Yet the genre’s catalyzing metaphor circulated a radically dehistoricized, racist conception of enslavement for a twentieth-century white readership, drawing its figurative vocabulary and sense of political urgency from chattel slavery while eliminating any concern with Black men, women, or children.","[('Laura R Fisher', '')]","['10.1017/CCOL052181555X', '10.1353/yale.1997.0020', '10.1057/9781137284563', '10.1353/book.467', '10.1215/00295132-4195016', '10.4159/harvard.9780674736115', '10.56021/9780801826641', '10.7208/chicago/9780226021676.001.0001', '10.1515/9780691187754']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Is it possible to adhere to all of Shaw's intentions regarding his play? In this way, Mason's production's intersections with and divergences from the source text can serve to elucidate Saint Joan's legacy of performance in Ireland and internationally.","[('Aileen R.

I conclude by speculating that such piteous solidarity might represent “the mobilization of common affects in defense of equality and social justice” that Chantal Mouffe has recently argued is necessary for constituting the “we” of a left populism.","[('Mitchum Huehls', 'Mitchum Huehls is associate professor of English at UCLA')]","['10.1215/9780822394716', '10.1515/9780822383871', '10.2307/j.ctv224twjx', '10.1215/08992363-15-1-11', '10.1215/9780822390404']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

I narrate my personal story about exploring and experiencing relationality to offer some reflections and thoughts on these questions which are relevant not only for IR, but to the ways we engage reality. I illustrate the potential of relationality by referring to three dimensions where relationality provides with alternative thinking: the problem of ontological difference; the pluralization and diversification of ways of thinking and being and the engagement with the other than other-than-human. These aspects are some among many others, but they announce opportunities, challenges, tensions, contradictions and possibilities. In the end, the essay reveals not only a transformative experience but a very different approach to water governance providing the reader a general understanding of the alternative thinking derived from relational standpoints and the possibilities it opens to theorize IR and beyond.","[('Amaya Querejazu', 'Aberystwyth University, Aberystwyth, UK'), ('Amaya Querejazu', 'Law and Political Science, University of Antioquia University, Medellin, Colombia')]","['10.2307/j.ctv12101zq', '10.33458/uidergisi.985929', '10.1177/0305829817702446', '10.1177/1474474012462534', '10.1215/9780822373780', '10.1017/S0892679419000169', '10.1093/oso/9780198850885.001.0001', '10.1017/s0260210521000450', '10.5040/9781474218788', '10.1093/isr/viaa100', '10.1093/isp/ekaa008', '10.1515/9781400873548', '10.1177/030631270203200506']",SAGE Publications
10.15393/j10.art.2021.5241,NEIZVESTNYI DOSTOEVSKII-THE UNKNOWN DOSTOEVSKY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Was the Dostoevsky Estate Profitable?,[],"In August 1831, the parents of Fyodor Dostoevsky purchased an estate in the Kashirsky district of the Tula Province, consisting of the hamlet of Darovoe and the village of Darovaya. In February 1833, they bought the neighboring village of Cheremoshnya. The entire property, including the above-named villages and hamlet, also included land plots in the wastelands: Nechaeva, Trypillya, Harina, Shelepova and Chertkova. Having become the owners of 58 peasant souls and more than 500 dessiatines of land, the Dostoevskys were considered average local landowners. However, Darovoe, well-known as the childhood place of the writer Fyodor Dostoevsky, remains poorly studied from an economic point of view. One of the reasons is that today there are very few documents that could reliably indicate the economic condition of the estate for the memorial period. An exception is the monograph of V. S. Nechaeva “In the Dostoevsky family and estate,” published in 1939, where, based on the correspondence of M. F. Dostoevskaya and M. A. Dostoevsky, the author claims that the estate they acquired was not merely unprofitable, but also caused a family tragedy. The opinion of V. S. Nechaeva became fundamental for researchers of the writer's biography. However, this issue can be revised today, which is what the presented work is devoted to. The correspondence of Fyodor Dostoevsky's parents, the letters of his older brother M. M. Dostoevsky, who was the guardian over the estate and the Memoirs of the younger brother of A. M. Dostoevsky in the aggregate allow to take a fresh look at the estate and the income it brought. In the context of this problem, it is of interest to refer to the newly published “Report of the headman of the village of Darovoe Savin Makarov to Mikhail Mikhailovich Dostoevsky” dated October 8, 1850.

Philosophische, psychologische und narratologische Dimensionen des Zeitbegriffs in Thomas Manns Der Zauberberg",[],"Der Zauberberg ist von der Forschung unter Rückgriff auf einen von Thomas Mann selbst verwendeten Begriff häufig als „Zeitroman” beschrieben worden. Dabei hat oft die Frage nach den historischen und literaturgeschichtlichen Zusammenhängen des Texts – als Rückblick auf das Vorkriegseuropa beziehungsweise als Spiegel der klassischen Moderne – im Mittelpunkt gestanden. Der vorliegende Artikel widmet sich der Zeitthematik des Romans aus einem anderen Blickwinkel. Zum einen zeichnet er nach, welche Zeitdiskurse – von Schopenhauer über Nietzsche und Bergson bis Einstein – sowohl auf inhaltlicher als auch auf narrativer Ebene ihren Niederschlag im Zauberberg gefunden haben. Zum anderen illustriert er, wie die poetologische Dimension des Romans in der literaturwissenschaftlichen Theoriebildung der frühen Bundesrepublik (bei Käte Hamburger, Hans Robert Jauß und Günther Müller) teils implizit und teils explizit nachgewirkt hat. Der Artikel zeigt auf, in welchem Umfang Manns literarisches Reflektieren über die schriftstellerischen Möglichkeiten der Zeitdarstellung die Unterscheidung zwischen Erzählzeit und erzählter Zeit antizipiert hat und argumentiert vor diesem Hintergrund für eine Lektüre des Zauberbergs als eines „Zeitromans” in einem breiteren theoriegeschichtlichen Sinn.","[('Tim Sommer', 'Universität Heidelberg')]","['10.1515/9783050081496', '10.5771/9783465139522', '10.1007/BF03374829', '10.1007/978-3-476-03470-0', '10.1007/BF03375186', '10.3196/9783465030003', '10.1515/9783110210781.47', '10.1007/BF03374967', '10.1515/9783110607017', '10.36198/9783838528427', '10.1515/9783050095554-004', '10.1093/oso/9780198793274.001.0001']",Wiley

10.1093/melus/mlz067,MELUS,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Unauthorized Storytelling: Reevaluating Racial Politics in Julia Alvarez's In the Time of the Butterflies,[],"AbstractThis article revisits Julia Alvarez’s critically acclaimed historical novel In the Time of the Butterflies (1994). While much scholarship has paid attention to the novel as historiographic metafiction, its depiction of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo’s regime (1930-61), and its feminist perspective on the Dominican Republic, its racial politics are under-studied. In particular, scholars have overlooked Fela, the Afra-Dominican servant, spirit medium, and storyteller. I argue that studying Fela’s presence in the text as an unauthorized and unauthored voice not only adds complexity to the production of historiography and storytelling but also provides new insight into postcolonial feminist critiques of voice/lessness, narrative, and marginalized identities in the novel and criticism on it. Closely analyzing Fela’s voice—as it intersects with storytelling, historical slave narratives, Vodou, the maternal, and Haiti’s contribution to the Dominican Republic’s history—makes visible the unacknowledged yet essential role of the Afra-Dominican not only in this novel specifically but also to the Dominican Republic more generally.","[('Tegan Zimmerman', 'Stephens College')]","['10.1353/cal.2000.0120', '10.14321/j.ctt7zt8g7', '10.2307/3201984', '10.5949/liverpool/9781781381847.001.0001', '10.1215/9780822373766', '10.5949/UPO9781846316517', '10.1057/fr.1989.30', '10.7560/751576', '10.2307/3250626', '10.1093/oso/9780195138887.001.0001', '10.5040/9798400675133', '10.2307/3346592', '10.1075/chlel.x.06tor', '10.1057/palgrave.lst.8600042']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The author argues that despite the effects of what Suzette Henke calls “scriptotherapy” the narratives may have had for their writers, two levels of haunting intersect and ultimately remain unreconciled in these texts : (1) the haunting of the sexual violence that affected the women personally; and (2) the haunting of the Nazi past. While the former is the main focus of the narratives in that they attempt to formulate what Urvashi Butalia calls a “vocabulary of rupture” around traumatic memory, the latter manifests in a contradictory representation of the Soviets as well as in narrative lacunae or erasure of Nazi Germany’s responsibility for the war. The author concludes with a reflection on contemporary sexual politics and the transgenerational impact of the haunting in children born of rape.","[('Agatha Schwartz', 'University of Ottawa')]","['10.1177/0263276412439406', '10.56021/9781421413525', '10.1057/9780230589728', '10.7767/9783205793953-004', '10.2307/778926', '10.1017/9781108563758', '10.7560/JHS26302', '10.4324/9781315880501', '10.5195/ahea.2017.281', '10.2307/j.ctvc77dmn.26', '10.1353/gsr.2020.0046', '10.1080/713687893', '10.1177/0959353506068746', '10.7767/9783205793953', '10.5250/womgeryearbook.32.2016.0025', '10.1177/0032329206290426', '10.1007/978-1-349-19865-8']",University of Toronto Press Inc.

Existing translations of the key term queynte range from the flowery euphemism to the straightforward vulgarism. An appropriate translation into present-day English needs to be based not only on sound philological analysis, but also on a careful evaluation of the register of the original Middle English expression. This article offers a corpus-based assessment of relevant candidate expressions in order to propose a translation that captures the appropriate level of (im)politeness, both of the narrator towards his fellow pilgrims and of Chaucer towards his readers.","[('Andreas H.

The most striking resemblance is that their stories feature their possession of stolen money, which they earnestly and inordinately desire to the point that they jeopardize life itself to gain or keep it. The relationship between these two characters, consequently, clarifies the moral-economic dimensions of No Country for Old Men and their bearing on the novel's interaction with American culture. As McCarthy responds to Twain, he challenges his predecessor's lighthearted depiction of Tom's brutal ambition and greed as well as Huck Finn's naïve notion that abandoning society provides protection from its immorality. McCarthy's interaction with both the Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn traditions suggests that the refusal to participate in degrading, consumerist transactions combined with a commitment to human community are the ethical imperatives for a society sustained by the ideological assumptions of optimism and individualism.","[('Rachel B.

Dostoevsky and His Correspondents,[],"The article provides an overview of the editorial principles in publishing F.M. Dostoevsky’s epistolary heritage. An analysis of these principles allows to discuss the evolution of goals and objectives of the researchers involved in the preparation of Dostoevsky’s and his correspondents’ letters for publication. At the same time, this review reveals the problems that the researchers have encountered and continue to face for over 130 years of studies of the writer’s epistolary heritage. The literary value of Dostoevsky’s letters was recognized immediately after his death. They aroused interest both as a biographical source and as part of the writer’s literary heritage. A significant number of letters to A. E. Vrangel, A. N. Maykov, N. N. Strakhov, I. S. Aksakov and others were published as early as in the 1880s. Particular attention was heeded to Dostoevsky’s correspondence with readers, writers, editors, and journalists. The first publications of Dostoevsky’s letters did not pursue any scientific goals and presented them as part of the writer’s creative heritage. Many problems associated with the systematization of correspondence, search for manuscript autographs, lost or undiscovered letters, principles of publication of epistolary sources have already emerged at that time. In the 1920—1930s, the researchers, still focusing on Dostoevsky’s letters, turned to his addressees’ letters, which began to be recognized as an integral part of the correspondence. The corps of letters of certain correspondents were set apart, specific epistolary cycles were formed, mutual correspondence began to be published, and a gradual mastering of its historical, cultural and commentary potential commenced. The emerging trends were subsequently developed. Principles that included the completeness of presentation of correspondence, precision of reproduction of handwritten text, and a scientific and critical approach to the study and publication of the letters came to the fore. Despite the significant successes achieved by the researchers, many problems of publishing Dostoevsky’s correspondence are still relevant, for example, structuring the letters in an integral manner. At present, the publication of the writer’s epistolary heritage and the letters of his correspondents sets the task of publishing a complete annotated code of correspondence both in print and in an electronic form. The electronic publication format has certain advantages, as it expands the number of manuscript material presentation modes and, in turn, the chance for researchers to further study Dostoevsky’s epistolary heritage and the writer’s life and work as a whole.","[('Lubov V.

10.1093/melus/mlac020,MELUS,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Toni Morrison's Their Eyes Were Watching God,[],"AbstractI argue that Toni Morrison’s Tar Baby (1981) is a deliberate rewriting of Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937) and was, at the time of its publication, a critical intervention into heated scholarly debates over Janie Crawford’s suitability as a representative of what Jennifer Jordan terms “modern black feminism.” Morrison recasts the early twentieth-century Janie Crawford as the contemporary Jadine Childs and, availing herself of the descriptive and explanatory resources of her post-civil rights moment, renders Jadine’s capacity for self-determination undeniable, thus calling into question contemporaneous critiques of Janie as Hurston’s failed attempt to write, in Hortense J. Spillers’s words, “new” and self-determined “female being.” The novels, read together, reject the foundational paradigm of Black women’s literary succession—built as it has been around models of accretive, intergenerational possibility, wherein each successive generation of Black women characters attains new heights of self-determination—which posits Hurston and her characters as the necessary precursors of but regressive foils to Morrison and her characters’ political and literary self-actualization. Given Janie’s and Jadine’s shared experiences, reactions, and choices across drastically differing sociohistorical contexts, this polarization, Tar Baby suggests, is more a consequence of critics’ entrenched presuppositions than any tangible failings on Janie’s part. As a pair, Tar Baby and Their Eyes Were Watching God exhort readers to forgo the quest for what Jordan calls an “ideologically correct literature” on narrowly contemporary terms and, instead, to pursue recognition of Black women’s agency and truth-telling on malleable terms, even (and especially) amid the historical constraints placed upon these characters’ voices and upon representations thereof.","[('Alec Pollak', 'Cornell University , USA')]","['10.1353/afa.2009.0039', '10.2307/1208786', '10.2307/464063', '10.1086/494559', '10.2307/2931333', '10.2307/3177494', '10.1353/dia.2006.0026', '10.1093/oso/9780195121735.003.0001', '10.2307/377306']",Oxford University Press (OUP)
10.1075/ivitra.34.11rod,VERB AND CONTEXT,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Time after time The mirative construction &lt;no irFut. a plus infinitive&gt; in Spanish,[],"Abstract This paper analyzes the construction &lt;No ir Fut. a + infinitive&gt; in Spanish. At first sight, the construction is made up of two futures: the so-called periphrastic future &lt;ir a + infinitive&gt; [going to + infinitive] and the morphological future (Fut.) in which the auxiliary of the periphrasis occurs. However, neither of them seems to denote posteriority. The construction is rather used to convey the speaker’s surprise towards a contextually activated situation that is considered inappropriate, which falls under the umbrella of mirativity. Both the deictic instruction of ‘distance forward’ invoked by the morphological future and the lexical characterization of the verb ir [‘to go’] are acknowledged as productive mechanisms in the creation of meaning. The uses of their respective spatial configurations, in the relevant contextual environment, explain the interaction between future and mirativity in Spanish.","[('Susana Rodríguez Rosique', 'University of Alicante')]","['10.1515/lity-2012-0017', '10.2307/414388', '10.26530/OAPEN_625759', '10.1515/9783110335989.187', '10.1017/S0959269512000154', '10.1075/cilt.150.20bri', '10.5565/rev/catjl.132', '10.1075/slcs.197.10cel', '10.1163/9789004292772_015', '10.31819/9783968692753-008', '10.1016/B978-0-12-505850-6.50008-6', '10.1017/CBO9780511620539', '10.1017/CBO9781139165815', '10.1075/fol.16.1.04cor', '10.1515/lity.1997.1.1.33', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199589876.003.0004', '10.1016/0378-2166(95)00059-3', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199679157.003.0010', '10.1075/hcp.12', '10.1075/sl.13.1.02fle', '10.31810/RSEL.49.6', '10.31819/9783954878710-011', '10.1163/9789004368873_005', '10.1515/lity-2012-0018', '10.1093/oso/9780199214433.001.0001', '10.1075/sl.35.4.03kal', '10.1017/CBO9780511620607', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195331967.001.0001', '10.1075/hcp.29.06lan', '10.1515/ling.1979.17.5-6.365', '10.3406/lgge.1981.1886', '10.1353/lan.2008.0054', '10.1075/hcp.42', '10.1207/s15516709cog0000_62', '10.1075/etc.5.1.04nuy', '10.1515/9783110820881', '10.1075/pbns.16.12pri', '10.1007/s10988-011-9103-8', '10.3765/salt.v23i0.2687', '10.1016/j.lingua.2014.04.009', '10.1016/j.pragma.2015.03.017', '10.1075/slcs.202.08ros', '10.3726/b15234', '10.1515/9783110711172-009', '10.1515/LING.2008.030', '10.1016/j.pragma.2012.09.008', '10.1515/9783110572261-009', '10.1163/9789004368873_013', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199679157.003.0002', '10.1017/CBO9780511620904', '10.2307/414841', '10.1515/9783110226102.1.29', '10.1017/CBO9780511486500', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199679898.001.0001']",John Benjamins Publishing Company

Este fenómeno se plantea como un proceso de reestructuración, en el que el pronombre posesivo se desplaza de posición y elimina la preposición que lo separa del predicado. Después, se presentan los verbos predicativos –pronominales y plenos– que potencian los posesivos argumentales. Entre ellos, se destacan los predicados no delimitados o atélicos. Por último, se señalan algunos exponentes gramaticales (posición sintáctica, concordancia, intercalación de adverbios) que permiten distinguir el complemento de régimen preposicional y el complemento pronominal posesivo, así como este y el complemento posesivo en el ámbito adverbial.","[('Vanessa Casanova', 'Department of Linguistics , Ghent University , Blandijnberg 2 Belgium'), ('Enrique Pato', 'Département de littératures et de langues du monde , Université de Montréal , Pavillon Lionel-Groulx, room C8075 Canada')]","['10.5209/clac.65654', '10.1162/002438902762731781', '10.1002/9781118358733.wbsyncom047', '10.1080/07268600500110480', '10.1016/S0024-3841(03)00102-5']",Walter de Gruyter GmbH

In today’s Spanish, borrowing words from other languages is a fruitful innovation mechanism. In Chilean Spanish, a significant portion of lexical neology comes from English loanwords, a fact that may be attributed in part to the global, open-market model upon which the country bases its economy. In this context and because of its linguistic and cultural relevance, we established the development process of the English loanword berry/berries in Chilean Spanish. To this end, this paper presents an analysis of the sociohistorical background that gave rise to the introduction of this Anglicism in Chile. This mixed-methods research includes the analysis of texts, interviews, surveys and field study. A contrastive lexicographic description of berry and its equivalents in Spanish is provided, the role of different types of speakers —from experts to laypeople— is analyzed in relation to the incorporation of this neologism in Chilean Spanish, the occurrence of different existing denominations is examined, some neologicity indicators are analyzed, possible combinations of berry/berries with other elements are classified, and the evolution of this Anglicism in Chilean Spanish use is confirmed.","[('Carsten Sinner', 'Universität Leipzig , Institut für Angewandte Linguistik und Translatologie , Beethovenstr. 15 , Leipzig Germany'), ('Constanza Gerding Salas', 'Universidad de Concepción , Departamento de Idiomas Extranjeros , Casilla 160-C Correo 3 , Concepción Spain')]","['10.4067/S0718-48832007000200008', '10.4000/etnografica.4244', '10.2307/340934', '10.1515/9783110931600', '10.1515/9783110489736', '10.1515/9783111662268', '10.4067/S0718-09342018000200175', '10.4067/S0718-93032019000100231', '10.1515/ling.2010.004', '10.4067/S0718-09342019000100077', '10.3828/CATR.3.2.6', '10.1515/9783110956054', '10.17979/rlex.2013.19.0.3981', '10.14220/9783737004473.663', '10.1515/9783110235067', '10.1515/9783110926897']",Walter de Gruyter GmbH

In medieval Catalan, the synthetic forms, with proclitic (el faré) or enclitic (faré-lo) pronouns, coexisted with the analytical ones, that presented mesoclisis (fer-lo he). These forms were distributed according to the medieval syntax of weak pronouns (Batllori et al., 2005). Analytical forms do not present univerbation (cf. Lehmann, 1985) and are thus less grammaticalized. In this article, the grammaticalization of these tenses is observed from the occurrences of Vides de sants rosselloneses, written in the 13th century. The results, compared with Spanish (cf. Bouzouita, 2016a) and Navarroaragonese (cf. Primerano, 2019), support the hypothesis of the diatopic diffusion of the grammaticalization process, according to which the grammaticalization is more advanced in the eastern languages of the Iberian Peninsula than in the western languages (Bouzouita &amp; Sentí, 2022).","[('Aina Torres-Latorre', '')]",[],Universitatsbibliothek der Ruhr-Universitat Bochum

Reading Celeste Ng’s Everything I Never Told You (2014) alongside Emily X. R. Pan’s The Astonishing Color of After (2018), I trace depictions of characters who momentarily imagine and are ultimately threatened by the disappearance of their bodies—a disappearance that echoes nineteenth- and early twentieth-century portrayals of mixed-race identity in passing narratives. During a time when mixed-race individuals are hypervisible in the United States, why are Asian mixed-race bodies dematerialized? Why do texts return to the narrative paths and tools of passing narratives? I argue that dematerialization is, unexpectedly, an enactment of post-racial discourse, which casts mixed-race individuals as harbingers of a raceless future, ignoring the lived experiences and histories of mixed-race people and interracial families. By recalling passing narratives, Ng and Pan highlight this failure to detect mixed-race realities—and the importance of recovering mixed-race pasts and presents. In the face of post-racial discourse, Everything I Never Told You and The Astonishing Color of After refuse to render mixed-race experiences immaterial. Rejecting co-opted futures and reclaiming forgotten pasts, these novels recast passing narratives to insist on the materiality of their mixed-race protagonists.","[('Melissa Eriko Poulsen', 'Menlo College , USA')]","['10.1080/13613324.2014.911160', '10.1525/9780520936256', '10.5406/illinois/9780252038075.001.0001', '10.17953/aj.43.2.158-175']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Frank Norris’s The Octopus (1901) and The Pit (1903) offer a case study of a naturalist Capitalocene aesthetics, one capable of capturing global capitalism’s destructive planetary agency. As a student at the University of California at Berkeley, Frank Norris was exposed to Joseph LeConte’s influential theory of the Psychozoic era, a proto-Anthropocene theory from 1877 that named a new unit of geologic time in light of humanity’s status as a transformative planetary force. Norris adapted this theory into a critique of a rapidly globalizing capitalism’s effects on the planet and the natural world, particularly the structures of agricultural capitalism in which complex financial transactions led to destructive wheat monocultures. This critique anticipated the Capitalocene, a contemporary offshoot of the Anthropocene theory arguing that capitalism (rather than humanity per se) is responsible for the present planetary crisis. The vehicle of Norris’s critique is his multimedia landscape descriptions, which invoke and subvert Romantic landscape aesthetics through painterly language and visual paradox. At the center of this aesthetics is a contradiction in individual and collective agency that is also central to life and art in the Capitalocene: confronted with an anthropogenic landscape that is both destroyed and made sublime by the structures of capitalism, individual viewers both feel powerless in the face of the force it represents and feel themselves implicated in its creation, despite different levels of responsibility.","[('Philomena Polefrone', '')]","['10.1086/596640', '10.1038/415023a', '10.1353/sdn.2015.0008', '10.7208/chicago/9780226805764.001.0001', '10.1353/san.2009.0004', '10.7208/chicago/9780226323176.001.0001', '10.1177/2053019614567155', '10.1353/sdn.2014.0061', '10.1086/271947', '10.1177/2053019615609953', '10.5962/bhl.title.163042', '10.1353/san.2012.0009', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195368932.001.0001', '10.4159/harvard.9780674061194', '10.2307/2710228', '10.1525/9780520920200', '10.5149/northcarolina/9781469622668.003.0006', '10.1215/00029831-75-1-61']",Duke University Press

From the beginning of his afterlife as a dramatist two issues have been consistently put forward by his contemporaries: 1) his art’s universality—for Ben Jonson, Shakespeare was the one “To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe”—and 2) his ability in appropriating foreign exotic environments which have notoriously characterised most of his plays. The value of such claims, which seem to be so present to us, helped to identify Shakespeare as an ‘universal’ icon whose work transcends time and space, gradually fostering, in and outside Britain, the so-called ‘Bardification of culture’, a phenomenon which persists, even more powerfully, nowadays. This study examines the different ways through which Verona has contributed in popularizing and elaborating the myth of Romeo and Juliet into a variety of formats suitable for the tourism market. By taking into account the so-called ‘Shakespace’ phenomenon, it focuses on what I have labelled as the ‘R&amp;J-influenced spaces’ which account for a number of civic, cultural, and narrative spaces generated by and constructed upon the myth of the Veronese lovers.","[('Eleonora Oggiano', '')]","['10.1057/9781137063762_8', '10.1075/sec.1', '10.1057/978-1-137-51835-4', '10.1353/tj.1998.0044', '10.4324/9780203360071_chapter_11', '10.1093/oso/9780198187035.001.0001', '10.7765/9781526102997.00007', '10.1515/mstap-2017-0001', '10.1017/CCOL9780521844291', '10.18778/2083-8530.18.09']",Uniwersytet Lodzki (University of Lodz)

10.1215/00029831-10084526,AMERICAN LITERATURE,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,The Scene of Eviction: Reification and Resistance in Depression-Era Narratives of Dispossession,[],"AbstractBecause evictions pervaded US working-class cityscapes during the Great Depression, newspapers actively covered their developments and aftermaths, trading in eviction as a commodifiable experience that could entertain readers at the expense of pathologizing evictees and naturalizing summary process. Against this eviction reportage, this essay identifies a disconnected coterie of authors and artists who represented evictions and anti-eviction protests in their works, mapping out an urban geography that attends to the sociospatial and historical politics of forced ejection. In the writings of H. T. Tsiang and Ralph Ellison in particular, eviction constitutes a spatial politics of violence and exclusion, revealing the state’s protection of private property and bourgeois class interests over the well-being of its working-class and unemployed residents. Illustrating the sociospatial politics of eviction, these authors exploited and contested popular genres of eviction reportage, which narrated dispossession as a pathology of the poor to legitimate the state’s violent protection of private property. Challenging this pathologization as well as the scapegoating of Communist agitation, this essay contends that these texts account for how the juridical architecture of eviction itself creates the space and social mechanisms for anti-eviction resistance to take place. In so doing, this article positions housing and homeless justice as a politics central to the aesthetic experimentations and legacy of 1930s proletarian modernisms.","[('Cody C.

10.1093/alh/ajz055,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,The Rise of Behavioral Economic Masculinity,[],"AbstractThis essay begins a cultural history of the behavioral economic narrative mode in American popular media, in relation to the academic discipline but not coincident with it. From podcasts to Michael Lewis’s books and films, the behavioral economic mode of narration changes the character or figure of economic knowledge. Instead of the distant financial expert, this mode insists on the authority of the friendly explainer. In the years around the 2008 crisis, at a moment when financial scandals seemed to be losing their power to scandalize, this mode asserted behavioral economic knowledge as the new standard of realism. As the affective structures beneath earlier capitalist realist narratives diminished in power, the behavioral economic turn marked a reassertion of narrative authority. The behavioral mode instantiated a new relationship to a familiar misogyny and is perhaps best understood as a cultural shift with varied ideological commitments to economic philosophy itself. The behavioral economic mode is characterized by scenes of objectivity training or moments where the viewer or reader is trained to understand objectivity as a performance of distance from the subject’s gender or race. Not incidentally, this performance is demanded specifically of those who do not fit the neoclassical ideal of the rational agent and who are not white and not male.","[('Michelle Chihara', '')]","['10.1093/alh/ajr017', '10.2307/jj.2353879', '10.1215/9780822389163', '10.2307/j.ctt17kk9p8', '10.4324/9781315640808-37', '10.5040/9781501314414', '10.1017/CBO9781139600224', '10.2307/j.ctt20p58td.6', '10.1086/261737', '10.1215/01636545-2349133', '10.3917/dec.laval.2018.01', '10.4324/9780203423240', '10.4324/9781315640808-4', '10.2307/j.ctvqsf19c', '10.1215/9780822376538', '10.2307/1600573', '10.5040/9781501313141']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

On the one hand, Jean Cocteau, the French poet-turned-filmmaker, epitomizes the Imagistic experimentations of a French filmmaker with the narrative framework of poetry to create a “page-based” movie. On the other hand, Abbās Kīyārustamī, the Iranian filmmaker-turned-poet, typifies the cinematic aesthetic of modern Persian poetry to offer visual images that rely entirely on the creative engagement of the reader. The rhetoric of Imagism, that short-lived modernist movement of the early twentieth century, is what these poet-filmmakers similarly employ in their cinepoetic study cases, namely Tempest of Stars (1997) by Cocteau and A Wolf Lying in Wait (2005) by Kīyārustamī. Following a comparative approach to their common Imagistic foundations such as economical wording and phrasing, cinematic adaptation of visual imagery, rigor and clarity of vision, the poetic prerogative of subject matter, the avoidance of vague and ambiguous descriptions, and the writerly approach to the rhetoric of the poem, this article proves that Cocteau and Kīyārustamī are respectively the epitomes of Imagistic cinepoetry in French and Persian literature.","[('Mohamad Mosavat', ''), ('Faezeh Mohajeri', '')]",[],The Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (ZRC SAZU)

That enables us to comprehend these as one of the most important tools that guarantee the visibility of the author in the literary field. However, despite the increasing number of research work, there has not been an advance in the study of the tension between gender and authoriality through the analysis of the portraits of women writers. This article recurs both to this new critical paradigm and to feminist literary theory in order to study some of the photographs of the poet Ángela Figuera Aymerich (Bilbao 1902-Madrid 1984) as part of a process of representation as a woman and an author in the Spain of the fifties. The study of three representative portraits show that the meaning of each image is not univocal but vary from the editorial space in which the photographic element is placed (the press, the books or poetic anthologies) and the discourses that surround the paratext.","[('Raquel Fernández-Menéndez', '')]","['10.26754/ojs_tropelias/tropelias.2015241139', '10.26754/ojs_tropelias/tropelias.2015241138', '10.2307/3177835', '10.31819/9783954876167']",Universidad de Navarra

Drawing on extensive archival research, I document the procedures of and theory behind drama professor George Pierce Baker’s “47 Workshop” at Harvard, operative from 1912 to 1924. Baker’s use of the term, I argue, provides rhetorical cover by which to slot arts courses into a Harvard curriculum increasingly geared toward utilitarian education. At the same time, the term signals Baker’s ties to the American Arts and Crafts movement, a cause opposed to industrialization just as Baker opposed the mass fare of Broadway. Reading Baker’s 1930 pageant Control for its advocacy of preindustrial values, the article concludes by contending that this distinct genealogy for creative writing helps us rethink the discipline today. If Baker understood workshop as an alternative, nonrationalized discourse, present-day craft rhetoric consolidates the authority of elite educational institutions.","[('Christopher Kempf', 'Christopher Kempf is a doctoral candidate in English Literature at the University of Chicago')]","['10.1080/00335631909360739', '10.1057/9780230339590', '10.4159/harvard.9780674493902', '10.2307/j.ctvjsf59f', '10.1515/9780691227740', '10.1126/science.71.1839.334', '10.7208/chicago/9780226841854.001.0001']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The original of this document has not been preserved, as it probably burned down during a fire that occurred in the Kuznetsk Church in December 1919. In the biographical literature, the text of the marriage allegation, which dates back to a handwritten copy made around 1916 by the priest of the Odigitrievsky Church, Nikolai Rudichev, is preserved and now stored in the Memorial House of F. M. Dostoevsky in Semey (Semipalatinsk until 2007). In 1916, it was published with a number of inaccuracies by the priest and local historian B. G. Gerasimov in the now-missing publication “Siberian chronicle.” In this article, the marriage search is reproduced from a photocopy of the lost original, which was made in 1910 and is now stored in the Literary and Memorial Museum of F. M. Dostoevsky in St. Petersburg. The signature autograph of the writer under the text of the marriage allegation makes it an official personal document, which warrants the inclusion of the marriage allegation in the main body of the Academic Complete Works of the writer, in the “Official letters and business papers” section. A significant part of the article contains the polemic with the hypothesis of Siberian local historians M. M. Kushnikova and V. V. Togulev, who believe that the said marriage allegation was removed from the Church archives and destroyed before the fire of 1919. They believe that it was done in order to hide the forgery contained in its text, which makes Dostoevsky’s first marriage illegitimate. While agreeing that the document really did contain forgery, the author of the article relies on the then-contemporary legislation in proving that the conclusion about the illegality of the writer’s marriage is a great exaggeration, and the hypothesis about the seizure and destruction of the marriage allegation has no serious grounds.","[('Boris Tikhomirov', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University

This article responds by turning to the Asian American campus novel, a generic category not readily deployed because of the recurrence of universities in literary and lived model minority narratives. Taking Asian American institutional racialization as representative of the ambivalence that subtends contingency, “The Diversity Requirement” connects the author’s experience as contingent faculty and as staff of the campus diversity requirement to readings of Karen Tei Yamashita’s I Hotel (2010) and Weike Wang’s Chemistry: A Novel (2017) through the figure of the Asian American student teacher, the apt pupils within liberal whiteness who lack expertise or experience and yet are tasked with teaching responsibilities for diversity without full access to institutional power. In doing so, this article theorizes ambivalent contingency—a mitigated agency and constrained privilege from within institutional contingency that reflects contradicting intersections of power within and beyond the individual—as a strategy for surviving the institution without reproducing its logics of exclusion.","[('Douglas S.

The author reads Alberto Ledesma’s Diary of a Reluctant Dreamer (2017), Reyna Grande’s The Distance between Us (2012), and Dan-el Padilla Peralta’s Undocumented (2015) as examples of the critical DREAMer memoir, foregrounding suppressed and subversive self-representation. Such self-fashionings are constrained by overachievement while still troubling the myth of meritocracy to determine deservingness of US citizenship. This trio of texts shows how school systems are mechanisms of coercive assimilation that reproduce a ranking regime wherein racial others are excluded or subordinated. Even as school environments can silence, they can also be safe havens for amplifying the human voice. The freedom of expression found in education marks a transformation of silence into advocacy. The present proliferation of critical DREAMer memoirs largely reflects a new shape of post-9/11 Latinx literature, as well as the subgenre of human rights and literature.","[('Guadalupe Escobar', '')]","['10.7560/309148', '10.1080/01440357.2020.1816876', '10.1017/9781316869468.024', '10.1007/978-3-319-64614-5', '10.1080/08989575.2020.1741187', '10.4159/9780674986459', '10.2307/j.ctt1pwtbpj.14', '10.2307/j.ctv15d81f7', '10.1080/00064246.2015.1012993', '10.1353/arq.2014.0015', '10.4324/9781003016472', '10.18574/nyu/9781479805198.003.0033', '10.2307/j.ctt1bj4s76', '10.5250/fronjwomestud.40.2.0219', '10.1515/9780804788694', '10.18574/nyu/9781479868766.001.0001', '10.1017/9781108698511', '10.1093/oso/9780190619800.001.0001', '10.2307/j.ctv1hm8jfr', '10.1215/01642472-7794343', '10.1057/9781403973665', '10.1353/hrq.1997.0019', '10.5422/fordham/9780823228171.001.0001', '10.1057/s41276-018-00171-x', '10.1080/01440357.2020.1818360', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816673261.001.0001', '10.7560/787414', '10.1017/9781108698511.010']",Duke University Press
10.1215/00029831-8616151,AMERICAN LITERATURE,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,The Biology of Intimacy: Lamarckian Evolution and the Sentimental Novel,[],"AbstractThis article explores the enabling intimacy between sentimentalism and biopolitics by turning to a less-than-obvious and yet characteristic example of the sentimental mode: the ubiquitous orphan tale of the mid- to late nineteenth century. It argues that individual orphan heroines of domestic plots not only function as tropes of domestic and national belonging, as has been widely recognized, but also of population regulation at the biological level of species. Sentimentalism functions as a mode of evolutionary theory, one that articulated the Lamarckian belief that sensory impressions shape the development of the individual body and of the species. Sentimental Lamarckism extended across literature, reform, and scientific theory and preceded naturalism’s deep engagement with evolutionary thought by decades. The sentimental orphan trope figures as a key aesthetic technology for regulating the growth of the population. Sentimental novels about orphans are not just about children who transform through their experiences; they were also directed at children readers and crafted to elicit emotional identification that could spur similar changes off the page.","[('Kyla Schuller', '')]","['10.5749/minnesota/9780816677276.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9780511485701', '10.2307/2928377', '10.7208/chicago/9780226035000.001.0001', '10.1215/00029831-76-3-495', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190277314.001.0001', '10.2307/2902710', '10.1353/book.61934', '10.2307/3195428', '10.56021/9780801880711', '10.7551/mitpress/3482.003.0003', '10.1525/ncl.2014.69.3.342', '10.1515/9781400823659', '10.7208/chicago/9780226720852.001.0001', '10.1093/oso/9780195063547.001.0001', '10.1525/9780520378735', '10.1215/9780822372356', '10.1215/00029831-74-2-345', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199779390.001.0001', '10.1525/9780520913868', '10.2307/464747', '10.1353/mod.1994.0015', '10.5479/sil.447686.39088007511512', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816693948.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9780511485695']",Duke University Press

It pays particular attention to the influence of Stacey Alaimo’s call for attention to the ethics of “transcorporeality” when it comes to reading horror, a need to imagine the human and nonhuman not as a binary but as intermeshed and mutually dependent. Hybridity in horror might thus present something not monstrous but politically desirable. Similarly, the essay explores the ways in which scholarship and public intellectuals have tended to see the recent boom in post-apocalyptic writing as either indicating the durability of late capitalism or the moment of its collapse and reshaping into something new.The books under review examine the outpouring of ecological horror and postapocalyptic fiction in the second half of the twentieth century and into the present. Why have such stories come so forcefully into the literary and filmic marketplace over the last 50 years or so?","[('Michael Newbury', '')]",['10.1515/9780271090436'],Oxford University Press (OUP)

The Jewish Enlightenment, which began in Europe in the early eighteenth century, caused some Jews to broaden their knowledge by learning subjects such as geography and science. However, most Eastern European Jews remained loyal to the rabbinical authority. When many immigrated to the United States during the Progressive Era, they had to choose between maintaining the old approach toward secular education and learning secular subjects. Analyzing three Jewish immigrant texts, Mary Antin’s The Promised Land (1912), Abraham Levinsky’s The Rise of David Levinsky (1917), and Anzia Yezierska’s Bread Givers (1925), this essay argues that these books present Eastern European Jewish immigrants as treating secular education similar to the European maskilim. Exploring Biblical allusions and imagery used to portray Torah learning, this paper determines that these texts sanctify nonreligious studies. Following a centuries-old heritage of learning, they glorify the knowledge obtained in American institutions. Although the protagonists feel they are betraying their tradition, they participate in establishing a Jewish American culture based on the value of studying. While these texts often praise American education, they portray a clash between American and traditional Jewish education, suggesting that disavowing one’s traditional education is challenging.","[('Ohad Reznick', 'University of Virginia , USA')]","['10.4324/9780203327722', '10.1057/9780230604841', '10.1007/978-3-319-51586-1', '10.58680/ce201218408', '10.3726/978-1-4539-0365-0', '10.1093/oso/9780199336388.001.0001', '10.2307/41206068', '10.1353/ajh.1998.0022', '10.1093/oso/9780195127201.001.0001', '10.1007/978-3-319-90044-5', '10.1353/sho.2014.0061', '10.56021/9780801854460', '10.1515/9780791482421', '10.1515/9781400829538', '10.22439/asca.v29i1.1527']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

10.1215/00029831-11218865,AMERICAN LITERATURE,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Taxonomy of an Enslaved Heart,[],"Abstract“Taxonomy of an Enslaved Heart” opens up the figuration of heartache, so common to sentimental writings, to consider how it can signify anatomical pain as well. What does it mean to read figuratively—accepting that every instance of a heart broken or throbbing or heavy indexes emotional pain addressing the reader’s sympathy—and, at the same time, to literalize these instances, so that each one refers to a specific episode in the history of a circulatory system? This essay attempts to hold both in tension, even as they resist each other. Attending to texts by Harriet Jacobs, Mary Prince, Sojourner Truth, and James Baldwin, the essay argues for what it calls the story of the heart: a minoritized account of pain that deforms sentimental language to register at once somatically, mentally, and intersubjectively. Because of its insecure legibility, the story of the heart subverts the biopolitical logic of legitimacy that traps many patients who are Black, disabled, or both today. What emerges from holding figuration with literalization subtly shifts the illnesses we know and the conditions by which we know them.","[('Shari Goldberg', '')]","['10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199540976.001.0001', '10.9783/9780812294743', '10.4159/9780674495364', '10.1215/9780822372066-005', '10.1017/CBO9780511780059', '10.2307/2927393', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199273942.001.0001', '10.2307/3177999', '10.1093/oso/9780192855596.001.0001', '10.1353/esq.2016.0019', '10.1215/00029831-7917284', '10.1215/-12-2-1', '10.1080/00497878.1995.9979081', '10.1093/alh/11.1.63', '10.2307/j.ctt5hjr8p', '10.1353/jnc.2022.0015', '10.1017/CCO9781107337725.016', '10.3828/jlcds.2014.15', '10.1017/CBO9780511812071', '10.1525/9780520378735', '10.1093/alh/ajy041', '10.18574/nyu/9780814740880.001.0001', '10.9783/9780812206180', '10.5749/j.ctv1c9hq90']",Duke University Press

The paper traces the process of politicisation of rock music and compares the two different cultural spaces by mapping each space’s state ideology, aesthetic traditions and identities, and discriminative political and economic tools used to marginalise rock. Here the term politicisation refers mainly to the polarisation between the communist regimes’ restrictive policies, and the attempts of the rock scenes to sustain their discriminating characteristics and relationship to protest. While in European communist states rock played a relevant subversive role, conversely, in China any ‘rocking’ of the state has largely been averted. The Chinese rock scene as an off-mainstream urban subculture has received less popular support than its counterpart in Europe and has also proved less politically significant. This comparative case study discusses the relationship between popular music and politics by tracing analogies and differences between the former Czechoslovakia, where the ideologisation and politicisation of rock reached the highest point in the Eastern Bloc, and contemporary China.","[('Rudolf Fürst', 'Institute of International Relations Prague, Czech Republic')]","['10.1093/oso/9780195139433.001.0001', '10.1386/fspc.2.2.257_1', '10.1525/9780520936539', '10.1080/09502386.2020.1844260', '10.1016/j.poetic.2011.12.002', '10.1017/S030574100500038X', '10.1080/07036337.2010.546849', '10.4324/9780203357057', '10.5296/jsr.v4i2.4503', '10.4324/9780203076811', '10.1017/CBO9781139051682', '10.1177/0009445515597805', '10.1080/02560046.2020.1830141', '10.1080/1067056042000281486', '10.1080/14742830120118909', '10.1017/CBO9780511586156', '10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00043.x', '10.1080/10304312.2020.1757039', '10.1080/14791420.2019.1637008']",SAGE Publications

It argues that in these works acedia, the originally theological discourse on the ‘sin of sloth’, articulates a form of passive protest against the conditions of working life and life more generally in ‘fast’ capitalism. Protest takes the form of exhaustion, boredom, and cumulative overwhelming, all of which are attributes of acedia. The article also considers how both authors experiment with signification, arguing that in so doing they expose what Slavoj Žižek calls ‘the inertia of the Real’: in the contemporary context, everyday digital technologies which remediate information. These aesthetic innovations, which emphasise the materiality of signification in the creaturely world of modern acedia, point to the frailty of contemporary capitalism and its uncertain future.","[('Mary Cosgrove', 'Trinity College Dublin')]",[],Wiley

Through an analysis of Haddish’s 2019 Netflix special, Black Mitzvah, this paper first traces the stylistic and aesthetic methods that connect Haddish’s comedy with that of her Jewish peers (both historical and contemporaneous) and then considers the areas where Haddish breaks new ground in her assertion of a non-paradigmatic Jewish identity that is simultaneously embraced and othered within popular culture at large. The paper then transitions into a larger discussion of the ways in which Haddish’s work challenges how popular culture “expects” Jewish identity to manifest itself; her double visibility both as a Black woman and as a Jewish woman destabilizes the hegemonic understanding of Jewishness as homogenously white and Ashkenazic. Perhaps more importantly, Haddish acts as an important case study of the shifting demographics of Jewish visibility within American popular culture, and consequently, the critical and popular response to her work demonstrates the contradictory role that popular culture—and comedy specifically—plays in confirming and subverting stereotypes.","[('Samantha Pickette', 'University of Texas at Austin')]","['10.2307/j.ctt6wq32v.15', '10.1177/1527476419855688', '10.5325/studamerhumor.2.2.0236', '10.2307/j.ctt6wq32v.19', '10.1353/aq.2003.0014', '10.1017/S0364009419000461', '10.1353/bwg.0.0011']",The Pennsylvania State University Press

Afinal de contas, se pergunta o próprio narrador, como pode um escritor de Jalisco escrever sob a sombra de uma figura como Rulfo?","[('Guilherme Belcastro', 'Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,  Brasil')]",[],FapUNIFESP (SciELO)

First, it considers the production and reception of the film, drawing on contemporary periodicals to illustrate Feyder's contribution to the film; second, drawing on Gilles Deleuze's conceptualisation of mirror images in cinema, it argues that The Kiss constitutes an important turning-point within Feyder's output as well as a key illustration of his authorial signature, looking towards the complex portrayals of women which feature in his most famous French films of the 1930s. Key to this analysis is how Feyder mobilizes mirrors to confront spectators with their own collusion in the construction of Greta Garbo's star persona in her films and portraits, and to open broader debates regarding the intersection between authorship and star personae.","[('Barry Nevin', '')]",[],Edinburgh University Press

After an outline of the historical context of evacuation, three aspects of the evacuee-host experience are considered: the decision to accept an evacuee, the material conditions in which the child was accommodated, and the longer-term relationships forged through evacuation. It is both an analysis of some of the historical dimensions of children's evacuation and a methodological exploration of oral and written data.","[('Lindsey Dodd', '')]",[],Edinburgh University Press

The spelling and translation of the aphorism, its grammatical and stylistic structure, as well as the possible sources of the Latin quotation are elucidated. The expression in question is contextually unrelated to the Russian text and functions as an independent statement. The semantic connection of the aphorism with the content of the pages where it is found is revealed. The Latin expression marks the theme of war. The juxtaposition of war and art inherent in the aphorism and traditionally understood as the impossibility of their coexistence, is interpreted by the writer as a paradox: through his paradoxical hero, Dostoevsky fosters the idea that only during a war true art awakens souls and mobilizes a society’s spiritual needs. Subsequently, on his own behalf, the writer speaks about the nature of true art, which arouses people by its lofty ideals in the times of peace. However, the social reality is such that the only way for a spiritually unhealthy society to awaken and cleanse itself is a war over a noble idea. The Latin quotation is a key link in the writer’s reasoning, and it becomes an instrument of his argumentation.","[('', ''), ('Anna Skoropadskaya', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University

A first step is the semiotic description of narrative imagination; storyworld elements come about through the laws that Peirce attributes to all semiotic processes (section 1). Besides, Peirce’s insights are used to show that those elements significantly differ according to their phenomenological or epistemological nature. From this description of semiotic processes, a matrix of nine different signs will be derived (section 2) that correspond to nine distinct operations of imagination. The hypothesis is that it suffices to attribute a distinct function to each of the nine signs to adequately describe the experience of a storyworld.","[('Bart Keunen', '')]",[],The Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts / Znanstvenoraziskovalni center Slovenske akademije znanosti in umetnosti (ZRC SAZU)

While Elisa’s desires are never clearly stated, an examination of the psychology and circumstances of American women in the 1930’s still living in the fringes of the Victorian era suggests that women want more independence and adventure than society permits. Steinbeck, always ahead of his times, intimates that the idea of a woman’s being independent and assertive is an important part of being human, yet society at large denies these attributes to too many women, including Elisa. Restoring Roe vs. Wade, long the law of the land, would be an appropriate starting point to assure a woman’s liberty and freedom to choose. Equality in the workplace would be another forward step. Steinbeck’s story opens the door for gender equality by revealing the anguish of a woman who lives her life under the confines of gender role constructs. Thus, the reader may readily see the danger in the oppression of placing a woman in a role that doesn’t fulfill her needs and desires.","[('Robin DeMerell Provey', '')]","['10.4135/cqresrre20191108', '10.2307/41582920']",The Pennsylvania State University Press

This reading has three key implications: firstly, that, behind the text’s metaphorical figurations, the sun is embodied within Billy himself, who acts as a conduit for its energies; secondly, through a solar material lens, Billy Budd and John Claggart form a solar assemblage, creating a confederacy with the nonhuman and signaling a non-hierarchical and open ontology. The final section turns to Captain Vere and the questions of judgment that have perpetually been asked of the text in order to posit instead, following Jane Bennett, a “solar judgment” that is sympathetic to and incorporates the nonhuman. As a result of these implications, I argue that Captain Vere, in his hasty decision to execute Billy, disavows and suppresses the vital force of the sun that permeates the Bellipotent , an attempt that ultimately fails. The essay thus affirms the omnipresence and potency of nonhuman forces within Melville’s texts and beyond, advocating for an empathetic and open reading that accounts for such forces, especially those related to the sun.","[('Christopher Bates', '')]",[],Project MUSE

Critics are unable to reach a consensus on why Gawain hides the green girdle before his confession at Bertilak's castle, and on what significance the second quasi-confessional episode at the Green Chapel holds. Ideas about confession developed by the likes of Simon of Tournai, Alan of Lille, Thomas Aquinas, and John Duns Scotus can help to decode these puzzling sections of the text. This article contends that Gawain follows a standard penitential narrative outlined by canon law and scholastic theology, from an imperfect state of sorrow for his sins (attrition) to a perfect state (contrition). That is, after his initial confession, Gawain embarks on a penitential development that is completed only once he has faced the Green Knight and returned to Camelot, turning from attrition to contrition.","[('Patrick Outhwaite', 'McGill University, Montréal, Quebec, (patrick.outhwaite@mail.mcgill.ca)')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

Shaw was quick to acknowledge the possibilities of “celebrity” photojournalism; however as an accomplished photographer and critic, he focused on quality artistic portraits of himself that drew attention to his cultural interests, photographic expertise, and friendships. Self-portraits, and photographic portraits by the art photographers Frederick H. Evans and Alvin Langdon Coburn, were selected for publication to promote his life and work.

He related them to each other and to caste, social classes, and capitalism. This article surveys Shaw's dramatic and nondramatic works, including prefaces, interviews, articles, and his novella The Black Girl in Search of God, to provide an overview of Shaw's views on racism (including his solution to this social evil) and to argue that his perspectives remain relevant to twenty-first-century struggles against it.","[('Bernard F.

10.1093/fs/knac272,FRENCH STUDIES,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,REWILDING WITH THE CRIIN MEDIEVAL FRENCH TEXTS: YVAINAND MELUSINE,[],"Abstract Focusing on two medieval narratives about identity transformation, Yvain and Mélusine , this article explores areas of dialogue between medieval literary studies and current perspectives on sound and rewilding the environment. Sound studies have in recent times enabled a more expansive philosophical reflection on the intersections between language, ecology, and identity. This article uses a friction between philosophical perspectives on the French cri and ecological ‘acoustemology’ to illustrate such reflection. If, as contemporary ecologists suggest, rewilding is a process underscored by careful human management in order to restore landscapes back to a state of wilderness, the same can be said of moments of narrative transformation in medieval texts that are revealed through sound. How might such interpretations of texts offer ways of linking textual modes of rewilding to the transformation of human and nonhuman subjects? To conclude, the article suggests how listening to medieval texts, to their narrative pivots and the changes in the sounds they depict, modifies the way nonhuman identity is discussed in connection with medieval (and non-medieval) literature.","[('Liam Lewis', 'University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom'), ('Liam Lewis', 'University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom')]",[],Liverpool University Press
10.4314/eia.v48i1.5,ENGLISH IN AFRICA,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Queer Hospitality and African Resistance in the Novels of Olive Schreiner,[],"This article analyzes moments of queer hospitality in two novels by Olive Schreiner to argue for new ways of understanding her complex views of race and gender. I focus on Otto Farber’s missionary ethics, in contrast to a competing model of imperialist domination, to show the beginnings of queer hospitality in African Farm. Otto’s disruptive Christian morality frames two of the few instances of African resistance in this early novel. While the unfinished later novel, From Man to Man, seems at first glance to embrace two classic Victorian domestic plots, those of marriage and of the fallen woman, I argue that Rebekah’s Cape Town home functions as a queer space that allows a radical rewriting of those plots. Her adopted mixed-race daughter, Sartje, and Bertie’s rebellious African maid, Griet, embody as-yet unfulfilled potential for women of colour in the novel. Rebekah’s redefinition of her own marriage and Bertie’s fall into prostitution create new spaces for women’s lives and allow us to imagine profoundly altered understandings of sympathy, maternity, and community. Drawing on Sara Ahmed’s call for a new communicative ethics in our globalized moment, I highlight moments of resistance and possibility in both novels to demonstrate both the political limitations and ethical potential of Schreiner’s South African vision.","[('Rachel Hollander', '')]",[],African Journals Online (AJOL)

In the Franklin's Tale we find ourselves trapped within the second nature produced by oikonomia: the world seems unchangeable only because we have lost sight of its historical character. Meanwhile, the realm of politics—and the authentic freedom it makes possible—hovers just outside the borders of the tale, a destination recalled but never reached. Fortunately, we have Dorigen's meditation on “the grisly feendly rokkes blake” to provide us with a model for the objectification of critical consciousness and thus with an apprehension of freedom. In Dorigen's critical “memory of nature,” we find our emancipation from inert second nature.","[('George Edmondson', 'Dartmouth College Hanover, New Hampshire, (george.edmondson@dartmouth.edu)')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press
10.5325/edgallpoerev.21.1.0023,EDGAR ALLAN POE REVIEW,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"Public Speaking in Poe's "" 'Thou Art the Man' """,[],"Abstract Poe's last detective story, “‘Thou Art the Man,’” has received little attention and less praise. In this ingenious tale, however, Poe revises his own pioneering narrative technique by making the narrator—who faithfully records the actions and words of the character investigating the crime—turn out to be himself the detective. Charley Goodfellow, the supposed investigator, is actually the murderer, who uses his considerable oratorical skills to persuade an entire town to convict the wrong man. Given this emphasis on unreliable narration and deceptive oratory, it seems appropriate to read Poe's satirical detective story in the context of public speech during the Jacksonian period, including political rhetoric, abolitionist discourse, theatrical performance, and ventriloquism. In the tale's climactic scene, the narrator publicly accuses Goodfellow by throwing his voice, making it seem that the murdered man's corpse has identified him as the killer by uttering the title phrase aloud. That phrase alludes to Nathan's striking indictment of King David in the Bible, which in the early nineteenth century was extolled as a model of successful rhetoric and often imitated in abolitionist writing, including a passage from Babbage's Ninth Bridgewater Treatise that Poe read before writing his story. The narrator of “‘Thou Art the Man’” not only quotes Nathan's speech but also imitates his rhetorical strategy. Poe repeats both the speech and the strategy, in turn, in constructing his tale. “‘Thou Art the Man’” demonstrates that artful rhetoric ultimately leads to truth, even in an atmosphere of bullying, chicanery, spurious accusation, and deliberate falsehood.","[('Susan Elizabeth Sweeney', 'College of the Holy Cross')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

Based on historical experience, as well as the work of modern researchers in the field of textual studies, the socio-cultural functioning of traditional spelling in Russia at the present time is highlighted. This is the language in which the Russian classics were created. Rehabilitation and functioning of traditional spelling involves the capacity to write and publish your texts in scientific and business communication. It is necessary to encourage the use of traditional orthography in professional literary-critical and linguistic activities. Technical issues need to be addressed, in particular, the introduction of a new standard for the Russian keyboard layout, the development of information and reference services on the history of the Russian language, tools and technologies for creating electronic texts.

Against this background, the paper investigates the relationship between illiberalism and various political and social factors in Romania, taking into account a particular context (the Russian invasion in Ukraine). Romania has experienced a rise in illiberal attitudes and the spread of populist and nationalist rhetoric, which is particularly concerning given its strategic location as a member of the European Union and NATO, and its proximity to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. This study aims to investigate the associations between various attitudes, news consumption habits, and perceived exposure to misinformation, and how these factors relate to levels of illiberalism in Romanian society. Given the increasing prominence of illiberal and populist ideologies globally, a nuanced understanding of these relationships is critical. The study employs a quantitative approach, leveraging an online survey to collect data from a sample of 1000 Romanian citizens. Soft quotas were used to ensure a diverse representation across age, gender, and education levels. Data collection was carried out by Dynata, a globally recognized market research firm, between March 1–9, 2022. Our analysis, informed by multiple regression models, uncovers complex relationships between trust in institutions, attitudes towards Russia and Ukraine, news consumption habits, perceived misinformation, and demographic factors in shaping illiberal perspectives. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the contributing factors, this study aims to inform public discourse and policy-making processes on how to address illiberal tendencies in society.","[('Alina Bârgăoanu', 'National University of Political Studies and Public Administration, Romania'), ('Flavia Durach', 'National University of Political Studies and Public Administration, Romania'), ('Oana Ştefăniţă', 'National University of Political Studies and Public Administration, Romania')]","['10.1257/jep.31.2.211', '10.1007/978-3-030-54674-8_1', '10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00410.x', '10.2139/ssrn.3321719', '10.1017/S0008423917000270', '10.1080/10286632.2020.1806829', '10.5937/jrs18-41766', '10.47743/ejes-2022-SI10', '10.17645/pag.v5i4.1156', '10.1080/23745118.2021.1956238', '10.1177/08883254030170020', '10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001', '10.1353/jod.2015.0009', '10.1080/17457289.2019.1666270', '10.17645/pag.v10i4.5515', '10.1177/1464884917724621', '10.3389/fpos.2022.907681', '10.1515/peps-2023-0029', '10.1017/9781108354943', '10.1177/2336825X231165469', '10.1016/j.paid.2020.110057', '10.1111/pops.12477', '10.1017/S1049096504004202', '10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00414-5', '10.1086/499414', '10.1111/1468-4446.12319', '10.1037/ppm0000387', '10.1609/icwsm.v17i1.22149', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198766902.003.0003', '10.7208/chicago/9780226299358.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9780511550362', '10.1017/CBO9780511790881', '10.1111/jcms.12193', '10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339', '10.1111/j.1468-4446.2007.00166.x', '10.1017/S0003975620000181', '10.1177/0261018315624168', '10.14267/cjssp.2017.3S.14', '10.1177/0022343300037002007', '10.1353/jod.2018.0043', '10.2307/j.ctt7spr6', '10.1080/10410236.2021.1996920', '10.1017/S175577392200042X', '10.2307/1951731', '10.1080/23745118.2019.1569334', '10.5817/PC2018-1-28', '10.1177/02673231221150347', '10.1037/0022-3514.76.2.229', '10.1080/10361146.2011.643167', '10.1017/CBO9780511609343', '10.1017/9781108595841', '10.1080/21599165.2023.2180734', '10.1086/706889', '10.17721/apmv.2023.1.154.34-52', '10.1111/j.2044-8309.1997.tb01118.x', '10.1145/358916.361990', '10.1016/j.adolescence.2015.03.011', '10.1353/jod.2022.0017', '10.1111/1475-6765.12425', '10.1177/0022022113490830', '10.1017/CBO9781139175043', '10.1177/00220221221084041', '10.55271/rp0010', '10.1080/01402382.2012.631312', '10.1080/09668136.2012.698052', '10.1080/21599165.2021.1876676', '10.1515/9781400884711', '10.17356/ieejsp.v1i1.28', '10.1017/CBO9780511559228.011', '10.1177/2336825X1802600110', '10.1525/j.postcomstud.2022.55.2.39', '10.1017/CBO9781139179072', '10.1146/annurev-polisci-041719-102711', '10.1177/02633957209759', '10.1093/isr/viac015', '10.1126/science.aap9559', '10.1080/23743670.2019.1627230', '10.2307/2095433', '10.1146/annurev.polisci.5.112601.144242', '10.1111/socf.12507']",SAGE Publications

The article discusses the important and often obscured similarities between the two periods and holds up the cultural assumptions and representations of these intellectuals’ collective discourse alongside their later critical reception by scholars like Edward Said, Armando Gnisci, Franca Sinopoli, and Magdi Yousef. Through this critical review of postwar intellectual thought, the article analyzes the ideological and affective charge of the idea of European literature as it is perpetuated through schooling and the paradigm of literary history. It demonstrates how, even though it was used as a defense against barbarism after the two world wars, the notion of “European literature,” like that of “tradition,” became a highly vulnerable construct after the advent of post-structuralism.","[('Neus Rotger', '')]",[],The Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (ZRC SAZU)

Genealogies of liberal guilt rarely mention Howells, and yet no American writer has more painstakingly elaborated the embarrassing predicament of middle-class complicity in social arrangements that entail the widespread suffering of others. I provide a summary of theoretical positions on liberal guilt as a structure of feeling that entails what Richard Rorty calls “doubt about [one’s] own sensitivity to the pain and humiliation of others, doubt that present institutional arrangements are adequate to deal with this pain and humiliation.” Howells felt these doubts profoundly, and yet he understood liberal guilt as a productive emotional and intellectual predicament. Put simply, Howells viewed liberal guilt, like realism itself, as an attitude of resigned acceptance of persistent social injustices but an attitude capable of animating, rather than dissipating, liberal commitments and public agendas.","[('Henry B.

Scholarly accounts of the relationship between Heidegger's philosophy and politics abound, but relatively few focus their attention on the substantial connection between Heidegger's reading of Hölderlin and the ideology that facilitated his choice to follow Nazism. Those who acknowledge this connection generally tend toward careless confusion of Heidegger's interpretation and Hölderlin's actual thought, despite ample evidence that Heidegger's reading amounts to a radical distortion of the poet's words. This essay accounts for Heidegger's misreading through the apocryphal poem “In lieblicher Bläue,” which Heidegger mistakenly attributes to Hölderlin. This is followed by a critique of Heidegger's interpretation through an exposition of Hölderlin's theory of Greek tragedy and the poetics of his late hymns. Theory and praxis alike stand opposed to Heidegger's aesthetic enterprise, and they defy any attribution of proto‐Nazism to Hölderlin himself.","[('John W.

Scrooge and Pickwick start out as relatively isolated businessmen who make journeys of discovery and learn lessons in compassion. Their metamorphoses are deepened through their relationships with loyal employees. This article explores the scant details about the two men's business lives, including Scrooge's role as a creditor and his connection to the Second Royal Exchange in London, which burned down in January 1838. It also contextualizes Pickwick's ties to the South American sugar trade and the enslaved labor that contributes to his great wealth.

Postnostalgia is an adopted “nostalgia”—though it not actually nostalgia—for a place and a time that descendants have never lived but long for as if they have. This almost-form of “nostalgia” is powerful because it is an affective and persistent response to the particular places to which they are connected, given how their families once occupied those milieus. This article treats Jonathan Safran Foer’s Everything Is Illuminated, which serves as a representation of how third-generation protagonists commonly attempt to discover pre-Shoah life by visiting the sites of family life in their family’s native lands. This formulation of postnostalgia offers insight into how survivors’ descendants in third-generation literature have responded to their inherited traumas, elucidating the common phenomenon of what is referred to as “pilgrimages” to sites of pre-Shoah family life.","[('Lucas F.

Proposing what I call Moss’s “African-Americanization” of the Holocaust, and by contextualizing Moss’s work in the early 1990s phase of the “Americanization” of the Holocaust and drawing on Marianne Hirsch’s concept of postmemory, this article focuses on Moss’s Holocaust poems in order to grapple with her poetry’s disjunctive themes and collective histories. Exploding the logic of competitive victimhood, Moss’s poems show how African-American experience does not compete with but rather works as a mnemonic device for other traumatic histories and other genocides. Her unusual upbringing leads Moss to multiply connections across traumatic histories, collective memories, and African-American identity in her Holocaust poems, even playfully so through her grotesque and darkly comic figuration of events. Moss’s poems extend the reach of collective memory and racial identity, multiplying their possible relations against the backdrop of the Americanization of the Holocaust.","[('John Claborn', 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign')]","['10.1017/CBO9780511585203', '10.1080/14623529908413937', '10.1215/03335372-2007-019', '10.1017/CBO9780511483196', '10.2307/4023128']",The Pennsylvania State University Press

The third section of the article reports opinions by medieval speakers about the intelligibility of different Italo-Romance varieties, and then compares them to opinions about genealogically and/or geographically more distant languages. While the dominant view among experts on Italy’s linguistic history is that speakers were trapped within mutually unintelligible vernaculars, this review of the extant evidence suggests a greater degree of intercomprehension than is usually supposed.","[('Alessandro Carlucci', 'University of Bergen')]","['10.3138/9781442673717-014', '10.1002/9781405198431.wbeal1001', '10.1515/9783111631134', '10.1075/hsm.6.04bra', '10.1179/0075163412Z.00000000033', '10.1515/9781501503542-011', '10.1515/9783110310771-017', '10.1484/J.TMJ.1.103433', '10.1484/J.MSS.1.100693', '10.1484/M.TCNE-EB.3.4609', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199744084.013.0010', '10.1002/9781118827628.ch11', '10.1016/j.specom.2017.02.008', '10.1080/14790718.2017.1350185', '10.5128/LV29.01', '10.1017/CBO9780511486623.003', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198727415.001.0001', '10.1007/978-1-349-20841-8_4', '10.2307/j.ctt1tqx89p.23', '10.1093/oso/9780198818960.001.0001', '10.1515/ijsl.1979.21.81', '10.1177/001458587000400206', '10.25291/VR/1992-2-VR-461', '10.1080/01434632.2013.860149', '10.1017/CBO9781139519373.017', '10.1002/9781118827628.ch29', '10.1080/02614340.2010.11917477', '10.1484/M.USML-EB.4.00193', '10.1007/978-1-349-26610-4_11']",John Benjamins Publishing Company

THE HISTORY OF CHILDHOOD IN FRANCE,[],"The aim of this article is to set the context for the studies that follow by assessing the historiography on children and childhood in modern France (including works produced by foreign as well as French authors). The first section identifies topics with the highest and lowest profiles in the existing literature. In particular, it focuses on the former, documenting the wealth of French studies of the infant welfare movement, education and the impact of revolution and warfare on the young. The second section questions the influence the history of childhood has had on historical studies overall in France. It argues that to date, ‘top-down’ studies, concerned with the role of adults in childhood matters, have been more prominent than those looking from the ‘bottom-up’, emphasizing the agency and voices of children.","[('Colin Heywood', '')]",[],Edinburgh University Press
10.1093/alh/ajac200,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Novels of Democratic Exhaustion,[],"AbstractA shared effort to make the US live up to its democratic promises was a regular feature of twentieth-century US fiction. Authors often wrote of the continuation of this endeavor, even in the face of disappointment, as the responsibility of an epic “us”—a national readership that was asked to participate in the ongoing quest. Contrastingly, in many very recent US novels, the collective pursuit of democratic redemption, however uncertain, no longer makes sense as a way to organize a narrative. This essay discusses contemporary novels including Ling Ma’s Severance (2018), Brit Bennett’s The Vanishing Half (2020), Asali Solomon’s The Days of Afrekete (2021), and Vanessa Veselka’s Zazen (2011), books that depict collective attempts to recover US democracy or make it anew as irrelevant or useless, while individual efforts to keep going in the face of crisis portend no brighter future. These narratives map the terrain of our contemporary democratic crisis, a crisis to which it is difficult to envision a solution. Not merely documents of defeat, these books also sharpen our desire for a different future, and they suggest that in seeking to narrate our way out of contemporary crises, we may need to imagine possibilities beyond the bounds of US democracy.Considered together, the books discussed here … map the terrain of our contemporary democratic crisis, a crisis to which it is difficult to envision a solution.","[('Sara Marcus', '')]",['10.1215/-12-2-1'],Oxford University Press (OUP)

This essay examines moments when scholarship sidelines novelistic representation of political activism and action, and suggests that novels of politics trouble a persistent gesture in scholarship by which novels and their characters are treated as representative—individuals standing in for classes, novels standing in for societies. But novels of politics often foreground tactical questions that fail to be representative; they look at political strategies that can’t or shouldn’t stand in the societies they hope to create, or at the way taking political action estranges individuals from the communities they hope to act for. Novels of politics look at what happens when individuals set out to trouble realism’s sense of “the way things happen” (James), and, in doing so, they raise broader questions about the gaps between means and the ends that are supposed to justify them.Scholarship of the novel . . . tends to see politics not as something that people . . . do, not a form of action, but as . . . a kind of mimesis: a problem of how social structures and populations . . . are made visible.","[('Michaela Bronstein', '')]","['10.7208/chicago/9780226923536.001.0001', '10.5749/j.ctt22727z1', '10.1215/00295132-9353766', '10.1515/9781400840090', '10.4159/9780674495074']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Drawing also from Luce, Watson, McCoy, and Prather, my article will demonstrate how narrative techniques such as metonymic displacement, metaphysical condensation, fetishization, and repetition make not only blackness, but also whiteness strange.

The success of the formation appears to be in line with that of other European (far) right-wing parties, which have become politically relevant in recent decades. Despite the Confederation’s growing position in European politics, there is a paucity of research devoted to the party. The present paper attempts to bridge the gap by focusing on Bosak’s 2020 presidential campaign and the politician’s use of Twitter. In order to investigate Bosak’s discourse in detail, corpus linguistic methods were used. As they allow the researcher to work on large samples of data, Bosak’s tweets were investigated at both qualitative and quantitative levels. The results suggest that the candidate focused on legitimizing Catholicism and conservative ideas. At the same time, he delegitimised the left and LGBT communities, framing the presidential campaign as a clash between the conservative order.","[('Marcin Kosman', 'Faculty of Humanities & Fine Arts, University of Economics and Human Sciences in Warsaw, Poland')]","['10.1002/1944-2866.POI327', '10.3366/nfs.2013.0049', '10.3145/epi.2018.nov.03', '10.17250/khisli.30.2.201308.001', '10.14746/pp.2021.26.3.4', '10.5040/9781350933996', '10.1075/jls.17018.bak', '10.1007/978-1-349-21599-7', '10.1075/jlp.21070.ben', '10.1558/genl.v7i3.333', '10.3390/ijerph18042002', '10.1075/jlac.00033.bre', '10.1017/9781316410899', '10.1080/17405904.2021.1933116', '10.1016/j.pragma.2007.10.002', '10.3390/languages6010012', '10.1111/lang.12225', '10.26431/0739-182X.1284', '10.1080/17457289.2018.1532434', '10.1017/S0007123412000336', '10.1080/1369118X.2012.706316', '10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.11.049', '10.1177/1461445620928814', '10.1177/0957926512441113', '10.1080/19331681.2015.1132401', '10.18778/0860-7435.29.08', '10.1007/s40607-014-0009-9', '10.5604/01.3001.0013.7834', '10.1075/dapsac.50.15kop', '10.1075/jlp.17032.kre', '10.1016/j.chb.2014.01.025', '10.3145/epi.2017.sep.02', '10.4467/23540214ZM.21.027.13758', '10.1108/14601060510610216', '10.1177/2053168016643346', '10.1080/17405904.2010.511832', '10.1515/zfal-2019-2005', '10.1080/15295036.2016.1266686', '10.1111/lang.12427', '10.1007/978-3-319-93503-4', '10.1017/gov.2020.11', '10.15581/003.33.2.175-192', '10.1086/720014', '10.1177/0957926511419927', '10.31261/polpre.2021.28.5-22', '10.2753/PPC1075-8216610202', '10.1080/2331186X.2023.2212118', '10.1016/j.langcom.2019.09.003', '10.1016/S0346-251X(97)00011-0', '10.2478/ppsr-2020-0006', '10.1093/ojls/gqu008', '10.15804/athena.2022.75.09', '10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190038', '10.1177/0957926514536962', '10.1287/orsc.1080.0394', '10.1075/bjl.11.03dij', '10.1177/1750481307071986', '10.3390/vaccines10040528', '10.1080/13597566.2018.1451846', '10.4135/9781529739664']",SAGE Publications

Zanimalo me je, zakaj je prvi roman ob svojem izidu presegel bralčev horizont pričakovanja in s tem dosegel tudi manjšo pripovedno empatijo pri bralcih, drugi pa je izpolnil horizont pričakovanja in s tem tudi večjo stopnjo pripovedne empatije na ravni recepcije.

Neskladje med bralčevo in avtorjevo empatijo je namreč pokazalo, da je roman Hiša Marije Pomočnice ob izidu doživel manj pripovedne empatije zaradi manjše bralčeve empatije, ker slovenski bralci ob začetku 20. stoletja niso zmogli deliti čustev in perspektiv ob tem Cankarjevem inovativnem romanu, in so se od njega odvrnili.

Como señalaba Slobin, la expresión del movimiento puede hacerse según las lenguas mediante la codificación de la trayectoria del movimiento o de la manera del movimiento en el verbo (Talmy), pero este no es el ´unico factor que permite explicitar cierta información o dejar otra implícita y conseguir un enunciado totalmente aceptable en una lengua. Nuestro objetivo es trasladar este tipo de conocimiento léxico a un diccionario sintáctico-combinatorio bilingüe, TACTICOMB, para una clase semántica de verbos que no parece implicar, en sus significados más ""literales"" ninguna combinatoria restringida (colocaciones), como la que puede verse en la mayoría de diccionarios de combinatoria. After Talmy (1985) and Slobin (2004) highlighted the existence of tendencies in conceptualization and lexicalization of motion events in languages, there has been a lot of research on this topic in different areas: Linguistics, Translation Studies, First and Second Language Acquisition or Second Language Teaching. As Talmy points out, the expression of motion has different tendencies in languages from highlighting the trajectory of motion to highlighting the manner of motion in the verb, but this is not the only factor (linguistic) that allows to make some notions explicit or to keep others implicit, in a discursively acceptable utterance (Slobin). Our aim is to try to transfer this kind of lexical knowledge into a bilingual syntactic-combinatorial dictionary, TACTICOMB, through the class of motion verbs that do not seem to involve, in their “literal” senses, a restricted combinatory (collocations) as appears in many combinatory dictionaries. Après les études de Talmy (1985) et de Slobin (2004) montrant les tendances dans la conceptualisation et la lexicalisation des procès de mouvement dans les langues, il y a eu de nombreuses recherches à ce sujet provenant de la Linguistique, la Traduction, l’Acquisition de la langue maternelle et étrangère ou la Didactique des langues étrangères. Comme le signale Talmy, l’expression du mouvement se fait différemment selon les langues, elles expriment dans le verbe soit la trajectoire, soit la manière du mouvement. Or ce n’est pas le seul facteur qui détermine la confluence d’información sur le mouvement dans un énoncé totalement acceptable dans la langue (Slobin).

The features of the novel that critics tend to dismiss—its sentimentalism, apparent acceptance of supernatural events, and so forth—constitute a direct and purposeful engagement with the conventions of romance, in contrast to Twain's more subversive treatment of those conventions elsewhere. This article contends that Personal Recollections Joan of Arc serves as an example of emergent modernism, which results from the dialectical process at work in the historical struggle between realism and romance and from the novel's own attempt to work through the tensions between two modes of fiction. Throughout the novel, Twain exploits and thematizes those tensions, in turn creating greater ambiguity and irony.","[('Nathaniel Cadle', 'Florida International University')]","['10.1353/book.67478', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190642891.013.5', '10.2307/j.ctv111jjv6', '10.5406/amerlitereal.51.2.0136', '10.1353/book.71832', '10.5406/amerlitereal.51.2.0095', '10.1353/jnc.2019.0021']",The Pennsylvania State University Press

I focus on strategies of editorial framing which, in each phase, insist on the apartness, and the authenticity, of Breton expression. These anthological, quasi-anthropological projects both anticipate and encourage the reader's touristic gaze, betraying anxieties about Brittany's relationship to the nation within which it must negotiate a place. These negotiations are played out in texts which, in their use of the French language and French poetic forms, operate a constant dialogue with the national tradition, a mode of self-questioning to which the poem is particularly well suited.","[('David Evans', '')]",[],Edinburgh University Press

Motherhood is an idea burdened by historical stereotypes, and I argue that Otoo and Wenzel use aesthetic means to subvert gendered and racialising mythologies and controlling assumptions about who can provide nurturing, reinscribing motherhood in ways that depart from Western expectations of an idealised one‐on‐one relation. Building on Michelle Wright's analysis of Black motherhood as a poetic trope of subversive agency, Theresa Washington's exploration of the West African concept of Ájè in African American women's writing, and Francine Wynn's conception of the chiastic mother‐infant relation, I suggest that Otoo and Wenzel show how the trope of motherhood can not only be subversive but (perhaps appropriately) epistemically generative. It can be read as a foundational image for a different epistemological discourse that does not depend on the mastery of difference.","[('Sarah Colvin', 'University of Cambridge')]",[],Wiley

These affective bonds between people and their pets paved the way for animal advocacy and the transnational anti‐vivisection movement. Gemma; oder, Tugend und Laster (1877), written by Anglo‐German author Marie Espérance von Schwartz (1818–99) under the pseudonym Elpis Melena, was one of the publications that launched the anti‐vivisection movement in Germany. This sentimental novel provides a model for late nineteenth‐century animal activism through the depiction of the title heroine, a young woman who is devoted to her pets and is determined to end vivisection in England. Published five years after Charles Darwin's The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), Gemma acknowledges strong relationships between humans and non‐human animals on the basis of common feelings and suffering. My analysis demonstrates how Gemma attempts to inspire compassion for animals by redirecting readers’ initial disgust at images and descriptions of vivisected animals to the vivisectors themselves. Yet at the centre of the novel's narrative structure are anthropocentric concerns, as if to acknowledge that feeling compassion towards non‐human animals – although it was gaining greater currency at the time – was still contested.","[('Holly A.

A través de un recorrido por su producción literaria –y en particular por tres obras que abarcan tres décadas de escritura: el libro de memorias La insumisa (2020), el poemario Babel bárbara (1991) y la novela La nave de los locos (1984)– se exploran sus vínculos con la tradición exílica de la literatura moderna y se analiza el singular aporte que supone la reescritura de esa tradición en clave de “deseo exílico” –un deseo “apátrida” por el que se positiva el exilio y por el que emergen un deseo lésbico y un discurso queer que cuestionan los fundamentos del heteropatriarcado, aliando su proyecto literario con el activismo feminista y LGTBIQ+. A partir de la noción de “deseo exílico” examino asimismo en detalle la reescritura de dos mitos bíblicos –el mito del Paraíso y el mito de Babel– de la que se sirve esta autora de manera recurrente a lo largo de su obra para articular una aguda crítica de las fantasías heteronormativas de totalidad y reivindicar los deseos minoritarios y los amores “otros”.","[('Julio Prieto', '')]",[],Universidad de Alcala

The discussion will alternate between two aspects of the topic: the particular claim to truth that witness literature puts forward, and the process that leads from catastrophe to creativity, turning the victim into a writing witness who can undo forgetting and denial. War memory and its intersection with the concept of trauma is explored in the works of authors Xhevdet Bajraj and Ivana Bodrožić, renowned poets of contemporary literature in their respective countries. Their views provide a geopoetic and cultural background for a theoretical discussion of literary and cultural aspects of war memory. The main objective is to examine the concept of poetry as testimony and its relevance to contemporary literature in Croatia and Kosovo. The theorizing introduction is followed by poems by authors, but at the end there is a theoretical offshoot on the topic.","[('Blerina Rogova Gaxha', '')]",[],The Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (ZRC SAZU)
10.1093/alh/ajab084,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Literary Theory on Acid,[],"Abstract This essay argues for the value of psychedelic experience as a framework for amplifying the social and political impacts of literature on the affective lives of readers and viewers. Psychedelics are chemical compounds that induce a hypersaturated experience of life that represents facets of the world to us in unfamiliar, intensified form. Neurochemical studies of the psychedelically “tripping” brain suggest that the experience can have wide-reaching, long-term positive outcomes including the expansion of one’s sensory apprehension of the world, a stronger ability to grapple with life’s contingency and human mortality, and the mitigation of depression, anxiety, and addiction. The author identifies several crucial ways in which literary criticism and pedagogy’s enhancement of cultural meaning making dovetails with the best aspects of psychedelic states, including the activation of readers’ and students’ aesthetic sensibilities. A psychedelically inflected criticism aims to achieve the psychedelic experience’s “blossoming of mental states” by revitalizing the literary text as a site for exploring, refining, and retuning the sensorium, thereby enriching one’s perceptual and imaginative capacities. The author unpacks how the insights of psychedelic experiences can shape distinct pedagogical and interpretative practices that respond to our current global political crises. This can potentially revivify the therapeutic value of the humanities as an institution invested in honing the creative and ethical faculties of generations of youth while attending to their long-term affective well-being.","[('Ramzi Fawaz', '')]","['10.7551/mitpress/11888.001.0001', '10.7208/chicago/9780226464589.001.0001', '10.4159/9780674978522', '10.1017/CBO9780511663994']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Dostoevsky in Darovoe (1837-1839),[],"The history of the Dostoevsky estate Darovoe, which is an important period in the life of Fyodor Dostoevsky, still contains unresolved issues. The most ambiguous is the fate of the writer's father, who ended his days in Darovoe. The cause of the tragic death of M. A. Dostoevsky and the place of his burial are still controversial. The document from the State Archive of the Tula region, published for the first time, allows to dispel all doubts about the location of the grave of M. A. Dostoevsky. The article examines the history of the issue, including oral tradition, analyzes well-known documentary sources, and the entry in the metric book of the Holy Spirit Church of the village Monogarovо in 1839 confirms the testimony of A. M. Dostoevsky about the burial of his father in the churchyard. The fact of M. A. Dostoevsky's affair with the house serf Ekaterina Alexandrova is questioned, since it was based on rumors and undocumented. The author analyzes the oral tradition phenomenon and its influence on the formation of the image of M. A. Dostoevsky as a cruel landowner killed by peasants out of revenge.

10.5209/cfit.73193,CUADERNOS DE FILOLOGIA ITALIANA,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Learning problems with three periphrases between Spanish and Italian. Acquisitional remarks and pedagogical proposals,[],"Il contributo prende in considerazione alcuni problemi acquisizionali particolarmente ostici e persistenti nel processo di apprendimento dell’italiano da parte di discenti ispanofoni. Sono noti, in letteratura, i fenomeni di transfer additivo e persistente di strutture perifrastiche spagnole non presenti in italiano. È il caso di andare e venire + gerundio, strutture “gemelle” di ir e venir + gerundio: contemplate e frequenti, in spagnolo, in contesti diafasici anche bassi e trascurati, tali perifrasi, in italiano standard e neo standard, hanno perso molto “spazio” d’uso, e sono oggi relegate a varietà diafasiche molto alte della lingua. Per estar + gerundio e stare + gerundio – la terza coppia di perifrasi considerate in questo studio –, notiamo invece, in italiano, severe restrizioni aspettuali: estar + gerundio esprime sia l’aspetto progressivo che quello continuativo, mentre stare + gerundio si è specializzata solo nell’aspetto progressivo. Ne conseguono fenomeni di transfer spagnoloàitaliano tipici, ben rintracciabili in realizzazioni come *sono stato lavorando tutta la notte. L’interpretazione psicolinguistica di tali problemi acquisizionali è basata sulla difficoltà di individuazione delle prove che possano permettere la ristrutturazione dell’interlingua: in questi tre casi sono prove negative indirette, ovvero la non apparenza delle strutture in determinati contesti o incongruenza con determinati valori aspettuali. Per lenire i problemi di transfer additivo delle tre perifrasi, in questo lavoro, dopo aver approfondito gli aspetti psicolinguistici di cui sopra, considereremo se e come le grammatiche pedagogiche di italiano per stranieri – in particolar modo ispanofoni – trattano queste discrepanze fra le due lingue. Proporremo infine alcuni accorgimenti pedagogici che possono essere utili per aiutare i discenti ispanofoni ad analizzare correttamente l’input italiano, così da lenire l’interferenza negativa fra le due lingue.","[('Maria Vittoria Ambrosini', ''), ('Paolo Della Putta', '')]","['10.1016/j.cortex.2012.08.018', '10.14746/ssllt.2017.7.3.7', '10.15366/chimera2018.5.2.010', '10.1075/sibil.50.05ben', '10.1007/978-88-470-5349-6_4', '10.1515/9783110197099.4.559', '10.1177/003368820003100206', '10.1515/9781614514442-004', '10.1515/9783110458268-010', '10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750', '10.1093/applin/aml015', '10.1111/modl.12532', '10.1017/S0272263110000264', '10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00080-9', '10.1177/0267658318809765', '10.21832/9781847696991', '10.1075/lllt.38.17jar', '10.1075/cilt.50.03lan', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195331967.001.0001', '10.3390/languages5020019', '10.21001/sintagma.2017.29.02', '10.3917/dbu.myers.2004.01', '10.1515/9783110820881', '10.1017/S0272263120000212', '10.21832/9781853599361', '10.1002/9781444315783.ch7', '10.1111/lang.12149', '10.5209/cfit.66537', '10.1075/lllt.52.10spa', '10.1515/9783110805291', '10.1017/S0261444819000090', '10.7591/9781501743726']",Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)

One of the more prominent and reliable methodologies used to assess leader personality through leader speech is Leader Trait Analysis (LTA), developed by Margaret Hermann. However, because LTA was developed using English language vocabulary and grammar, its accuracy using Russian language speeches to discern leader personality traits has relied on translation. Translation is both inefficient and may not accurately transfer the semantics of speech upon which LTA’s results depend. Responding to this issue, this paper applies Mona Baker’s translation studies criteria to qualitatively compare the semantic equivalence, or maintenance of a text’s original meaning, between English translations used to create an LTA profile for Vladimir Putin and Putin’s original Russian speeches. The research identifies the preponderance of grammatical differences between English and Russian in limiting how well English translations of Russian speech maintain semantic equivalence relevant to assessing leader personality. It is concluded that an accurate understanding of Russian leaders’ personalities requires Russian language specific LTA profiling.","[('Katherine Hallin', 'University of St Andrews School of International Relations, St Andrews, UK'), ('Katherine Hallin', ""University of St. Andrew's school of Modern Languages, St Andrews, UK"")]","['10.1111/1521-9488.00238', '10.1080/13642987.2017.1383240', '10.1080/13501763.2015.1127277', '10.1093/isr/viaa001', '10.1080/09668136.2020.1749566', '10.1162/01622880151091916', '10.1093/isp/ekaa016', '10.1017/S0003055411000219', '10.1057/jird.2014.31', '10.1111/pops.12333', '10.1177/0022002703261053', '10.1111/0162-895X.00206', '10.1093/pa/gss007', '10.1080/02684527.2017.1313523', '10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00006.x', '10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00903.x', '10.1111/fpa.12019', '10.1007/978-3-030-37763-2', '10.1111/1467-856X.00110', '10.1177/014616728063002', '10.2307/2600126', '10.1111/1521-9488.5020012', '10.1111/misr.12213', '10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00447.x', '10.1080/14683849.2019.1575735', '10.1145/2635648.2635657', '10.1145/2635648.2635657', '10.1515/lingvan-2015-1004', '10.1080/13600826.2016.1269056', '10.1111/modl.12177', '10.1007/s11185-018-9196-6', '10.1177/1369148120910984', '10.1177/2053168014558970', '10.1080/13537121.2015.1111638', '10.2307/412307', '10.1162/isec.2009.34.2.119', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199653881.013.032', '10.1093/fpa/orac008', '10.1057/9781403983497_2', '10.4324/9781003131021', '10.4324/9781003131021', '10.2307/2600414', '10.1111/pops.12206', '10.1111/lnc3.12364', '10.1093/isq/sqab083', '10.2307/3791696', '10.1017/CBO9780511612183', '10.1177/0192512117694481', '10.5539/jpl.v13n1p123', '10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00852.x']",SAGE Publications

The likeliest conclusion to be drawn from a comparison of findings is that the two poetic traditions are rather similar in regard to kenning use. In both traditions, kennings are notably simpler and less riddle-like than in skaldic poetry, though theEddacontains a few kennings of sufficient complexity to suggest skaldic influence. Although kennings, on average, occur more frequently in Old English, the incidence is broadly similar to that in the Poetic Edda. Kennings are not uncommonly explained by the use of variation (apposition) in Old English, but less commonly in theEdda, although the difference does not specifically suggest discrepant attitudes toward kenning use in the two traditions, since variation is rare in theEddaunder all circumstances. Although the possibility of the influence of one tradition upon the other cannot be ruled out, the similarities, in the main, are probably best explained as the result of common inheritance. This explanation garners support from the number of instances in which more or less precise cognate kennings appear in the two bodies of literature.","[('Robert D.

It was during this period that John Marston at Paul's and Ben Jonson at Blackfriars attracted attention at these theaters by ridiculing each other personally and denigrating each other's work. In doing so they converted these playhouses into forums for staging ideologically opposed interpretations of drama. Rather than aligning themselves with each other against the “public” theater, as Alfred Harbage had assumed in his influential chapter on “The Rival Repertories” in Shakespeare and the Rival Traditions, Jonson and Marston's satire of each other's work used Paul's and Blackfriars to debate the question of the legitimacy of the drama they staged and the status of the writers who composed it. Their debate on what drama should and should not be constitutes one of the most significant critical controversies in early modern English theater. It constitutes part of the first significant criticism of contemporary drama in English. The point of this essay is to account for how, when Jonson began writing for the Children of the Chapel at Blackfriars in 1600, Marston at Paul's became one of his principal targets through personal invective framed as a series of generalized strictures excoriating the obscenity and plagiarism of contemporary private theater.","[('James P.

Because it has persistently failed to theorize the intellectual and methodological assumptions underlying its practice, Jewish American literary study remains burdened by the essentialist implications of an ethnological historicism. This article ultimately argues that Jewish American literary study needs to take more seriously the possibilities offered by a materialist epistemology rather than the Jewish studies-based historicist ontology it has mostly taken for granted. “My hope is that a Jewish American epistemology can operate outside the penumbra of a tired and played-out concept of ethnicity—a term that unavoidably, if spectrally, posits a biologistic object at the heart of its historicist project—even as it might still claim the mantle of Jewish-y-ness.”","[('Benjamin Schreier', 'Mitrani Family Professor of Jewish Studies and Professor of English and Jewish Studies at Penn State University')]","['10.1086/379981', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199926695.001.0001', '10.2979/prooftexts.36.1-2.01']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

In doing so, the article puts forth the claim that the ideas of “contradiction” and “beside” offer important insights into understanding the formal innovations and thematic qualities of Cane.

While many critics have celebrated Dirty Computer for its embrace of queer identity and assertion of Black humanity, they have often done so by pitting it against her earlier work, which often features her cyborg alter-ego and riffs on iconic imagery from the films Metropolis (1927) and Blade Runner (1982), aligning her with speculative traditions concerned with the enmeshment of human and machine. I argue that the formulation of the “dirty computer” is not a departure but an intensification and distillation of her commitment to deconstructing the category of the human and disrupting the human/machine divide. The body as dirty computer interrogates the efficacy of Donna J. Haraway’s version of cyborg being for Black women, whose bodies have been scripted as less-than-human for so long, by calling on Black feminist traditions from Hortense J. Spillers onward that center fleshy materiality as a means of resistance to the hegemonic construction of the human body. In conversation with scholars such as Alexander Weheliye and Uri McMillan, who argue that Blackness is itself a technics, the dirty computer performs an always already virtual Black body materialized through technologies of the voice and citational practices that disrupt linear temporality. Monáe articulates an Afrofuturist feminist vision for embodiment that rejects transhumanism by embracing the messiness of the body as an essential tool for testifying.","[('Zoë Rodine', 'University of Minnesota, USA')]","['10.1086/345321', '10.1177/0263276407085156', '10.1353/ams.2013.0116', '10.7208/chicago/9780226321394.001.0001', '10.5250/fronjwomestud.39.1.0042', '10.2307/j.ctt15zc7kv', '10.18574/nyu/9781479856275.001.0001', '10.2307/464747', '10.12801/1947-5403.2013.05.02.02']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

On the one hand, I will shed light on Massinger’s use of an Italian ambience, concentrating on the choice of Palermo and Siena as a setting. The pseudo-historic setting of the play may be seen as a pretext to dramatize the author’s moral needs and convey a form of political ideology, which reflects the social tensions and the political concerns of the period. On the other hand, I will discuss the different forms of legacy from the Italian world, focusing on the cultural forces, and the moral and ideological motivations behind the playwright’s choice of the genre of his play, the changes concerning plot, setting and the characters’ names in the original Italian text on which the tragicomedy is based. Moreover, this tragicomedy, characterized by a profound didactic and moral intent, also seems to combine some elements of the late 16th century commedia grave, mainly in the presence of an exemplary female protagonist, Camiola, who embodies the providential spirit of the Counter-Reformist attitudes in vogue in the period. Finally, I will examine the way an image of Italy is portrayed through language, analyzing the very marginal occurrence of the Italian language and the presence of Latin words and tags.","[('Cristina Paravano', 'University of Milan')]","['10.1086/rd.2.41917042', '10.1111/j.1477-4658.2010.00698.x', '10.2307/3506942']",Edinburgh University Press

Piers Plowman is a recognized anomaly, yet there is disagreement about the extent of the differences. In this article, I examine long final dips, the vocalic quality of syllables in the final dip, and the placement of word divisions. Throughout, my focus is on the B version of the poem. I make a survey of lines with a word division after the final lift and of lines ending in -ly adverbs, compounds in -man, compounds in -nesse, nouns in -(i)oun, and gerunds. I compare the frequency of each sequence at the close of the a-verse and b-verse, observing that many individual items skew towards the norms of usage observed in other alliterative poems. Yet, more than other alliterative poets, Langland allows semantic and expository priorities to override prosodic form.","[('Ian Cornelius', 'Loyola University Chicago Chicago, Illinois (icornelius@luc.edu)')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

This is as true when counting formulae of the Parry-Lord variety according their theory of oral-formulaic composition as it is when counting the more flexibly defined formulaic expressions of the sort permitted under the theory of oral traditionalism. Both methods, however, probably give an inflated view of the extent to which orally-based thinking was involved in composition of the romances, since they focus exclusively on the formulaic surface-structure expressions which do not always accurately reflect deep-structure ideas or frames of thought. The present concise examination of the Matter of England romances – a subset of the Middle English verse romances spanning the lifetime of the genre – suggests that, contrary to what one might expect, the number, length and complexity of such formulaic expressions actually appear to increase as evidence of purely orally-based thought declines. This finding is realized by briefly measuring the extent to which each romance instantiates Walter Ong’s nine psychodynamic characteristics of orally based thought and expression, five of which concern the deep-structure frames of the former with the remaining four concerned with the surface-structure scripts of the latter. It then concludes by proposing that the much-vaunted residual traces of orality in the formulaic expressions are not so much true reflections of orally-based thinking as they are contrived literary “skeuomorphs” masquerading as such in order to lend the tales credibility and authenticity.","[('John-C.

The interface examination of the interpretative, syntactic and prosodic properties of CLRDs shows that these constructions can be ordered on a scale based to a minor or greater degree of prosodic and syntactic integration between verb and post-verbal object. This scale of integration is based on the hypothesis that the different dislocations are part of a complex system of resources for the post-verbal expression of topic and focus categories. Crucially, the study shows that in interrogative CLRDs the clitic resumes an accessible referent which is also focal, manifesting the greater intersubjective attitude of the speaker.

Perisauli's poem in octaves, which is a response to the misogynist text Sonaglio delle donne composed by Bernardo Giambullari, is one of the few examples of compositions in verse within the debate on female dignity that had already been developed in the fourteenth century with texts such as Ahi lasso che li boni e li malvagi de Guittone d'Arezzo. Following his example, Perisauli proclaimed himself an advocate of the female sex and refuted some of the prejudices and accusations addressed to women. He introduces a whole series of arguments that would also be used by the 16th-century “defenders of women” in their dialogues and by the women writers of the 16th and 17th centuries. Addressing his antagonist to all men in general, the author of the Trastullo thus seems to propose in his text, albeit in a playful manner, a different model of masculinity.

The essay discusses not only how the poets wrote but also how they realised the printed forms of their poetry in performance, contrasting Olson’s literal performance of his theories with the different relation of print to performance of his contemporary and associate William Carlos Williams. It argues that Olson’s experiments, polemically formulated in his manifestoProjective Verse, while they have influenced central currents of American poetry since the 1950s, have remained largely American, whereas Celan’s, tentatively intimated in his anti-manifestoDer Meridian, and inimitably personal in their specific forms, can also be seen as modelling ways in which a wide range of twentieth- and twenty-first-century poetry can be realised in reading aloud.","[('David Fuller', '')]","['10.3998/mpub.14048', '10.2307/358524', '10.4148/2334-4415.1134', '10.3998/mpub.13441', '10.3998/mpub.15381']",Springer International Publishing

Arendt and Müller are ethical, phenomenological, and instinctively iconoclastic thinkers who insist on the value of experience and are unafraid to think and speak, to use Arendt's term, ‘without a banister’. Both mount a modernist challenge to totalising discourses and seek out the possibilities of humanity in dark times, locating these in ideology's opposites: singularity, newness, and infinite possibility, in short, in the ‘natality’ (Arendt) which characterises the human condition. Müller's protagonists experience the loneliness and atomisation that Arendt identified as central to totalitarian rule, but they are also survivors and witnesses whose stories illuminate across time. Müller's disorienting collage technique, reminiscent of Benjamin's montages of quotations, promotes in the consumer a process of judgement and thought, a ‘vigilant partiality’ (Arendt on G. E. Lessing) which spurs engagement with the issues of their own era.","[('Brigid Haines', 'Swansea University')]",[],Wiley

The novel is largely based on Pastior's experience as one among the thousands of Romanian‐Germans deported to Gulags in 1945, and the poet worked with Müller both as a source and a literary collaborator before his death. Müller does not directly reproduce Pastior's poetics or his experience in her novel, but she engages with both using dynamic, paratactical structures reminiscent of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's notion of ‘assemblage’. Müller's interaction with Pastior benefits from an overlap between their poetic concerns: both writers’ oeuvres are marked by traumatic experiences of totalitarianism, and by a desire to undermine the master‐narratives of ideology. In Atemschaukel their poetics become entangled, evoking both resistance to totalitarian structures, and the trauma these same structures inflict. The dynamic poetic forms Müller uses to engage with Pastior also help her to negotiate a fraught memory space that not only includes Soviet crimes, but is also overshadowed by Nazi atrocity. Through the use of paratactical poetic motifs Müller acknowledges the presence of multiple painful historical currents, without shaping them into an undifferentiated whole.","[('Hannah Vinter', ""King's College London"")]",[],Wiley

My interest lies in exploring the challenge that Müller's approach to the labour of memory poses to conceptions of cultural memory and, related to it, to notions of national identity, national literary canons, and authorship. I ask how the ethical and aesthetic precepts of Müller's disruptive memories in her written work and her numerous public interventions may contribute to an affirmation of human rights today – at a time when democratic values are increasingly under threat. I argue that Müller's work – augmented by her public engagement – contributes to the reshaping of cultural memory from a narrowly conceived national one toward a deterritorialised collective memory that may transcend national and ethnic boundaries and foster new kinds of solidarity.","[('Karin Bauer', 'McGill University')]",[],Wiley

By engaging this question, this collection of essays offers new insights about these women’s writing in particular and expands the corpus of scholarship on Black women’s writing in general. In the aftermath of the passing of these writers, a collective reappraisal of their oeuvres is a timely and fitting tribute, as each of their bodies of work reveals that they long have engaged concerns about Black people’s encounters with systemic barriers that have laid the foundation for the current twinned crises of anti-Black violence and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19.","[('Robin Brooks', 'University of Pittsburgh, USA'), ('Robin Brooks', 'University of Pittsburgh, USA'), ('Meina Yates-Richard', 'Emory University, USA'), ('Meina Yates-Richard', 'Emory University, USA')]","['10.1542/peds.2020-015917', '10.4324/9780203309506', '10.3998/mpub.10257', '10.2307/467272', '10.4159/9780674982628', '10.1215/9781478002253', '10.4159/harvard.9780674061194', '10.1353/lit.2020.0029']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

While Eliot’s ending calls for a humanistic faith rooted in compassion and fellowship, Shaw dismissed individual compassion as an ineffective substitute for socialist reform. Moreover, whereas Eliot’s novel ultimately rejects the idea of religious institutions, Shaw left the issue unsettled in Major Barbara and returned to it in later writings in an effort to formulate an idea of a widely shared religion grounded in economic equity and cooperation with the Life Force.","[('Mary Christian', 'Middle Georgia State University')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

It presents the results of the analysis of Dostoevsky’s 1868–1869 workbook (“The Idiot”) and later entries. It became clear that without reference to handwritten sources, it is impossible to solve certain tasks that include the correction of research errors in reading Dostoevsky’s manuscripts and determination of the author’s original text. Methodologically significant conditions of textual work with autographs are a combination of linguistic (that is grammatical, spelling, punctuation) analysis of Dostoevsky’s drafts and the study of letter and non-letter graphics. Previously, researchers had to depend on isolated, accidentally discovered examples of similar spellings and, in general, on their accumulated experience of reading Dostoevsky’s handwriting. This method did not ensure the representativeness of the result, because there was no large-scale continuous sampling of each letter’s handwriting in different positions or summary tables or databases. Non-automated, “manual” analysis did not always allow to quickly find an unambiguous and reliably articulated solution. Today a graphics database on the “Archive of F. M. Dostoevsky” portal has become an important tool for the textual research of the writer’s manuscripts, which significantly increases work efficiency. This is a digital archive of images of the writer’s notebooks and their interpretation in authentic and modern language versions. Based on this archive, a replenishable “Library of graphic samples” is also being created. It contains samples of different types of the writer’s handwriting and nonverbal graphics (drawings, figures, author’s signs, editing marks). The electronic catalog of graphic samples allows to systematize the writing, find typical and atypical samples among them. This is an additional important criterion for the argumentation of certain research readings when interpreting Dostoevsky’s handwritten text. Technical tools have been developed specifically for the database, that is: marker fields that describe the individual parameters of each lexeme and allow conducting an advanced search in the “Library of Graphic Samples.” With its help, it is possible to quickly find all patterns of the same type for their further analysis. Thus, this resource will become an important tool in the complex graphic and linguotextological analysis of the writer’s handwritten material.","[('Lyubov Alekseeva', ''), ('Tatiana Panyukova', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University

Following an outline of pertinent events from 2014 to 2022, including the Song Contest and the respective countries’ selected entries as well as the public discourse surrounding them, two distinct types of cultural diplomacy—culturalist versus neo-propagandist—are employed in a congruence analysis. The findings show that Russia employed a largely neo-propagandist approach to cultural diplomacy characterized by their projected image of peacefulness, innocence, and strength to alter their situational image. Ukraine has employed a mostly culturalist approach mainly focused on mutual recognition and the representation of national culture. The conscious instrumentalization of the platform to counter misconstrued perceptions of Ukraine shaped by the Kremlin’s rhetoric also adds neo-propagandist elements.","[('Lea M Welslau', 'Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Germany'), ('Torsten J Selck', 'Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Germany')]","['10.2298/MUZ0707039B', '10.1007/978-981-13-9427-0_8', '10.5642/urceu.201701.06', '10.1111/russ.10717', '10.1017/S0960777316000126', '10.1057/9781137367983', '10.1142/S0219525913500379', '10.4324/9780429465543-6', '10.1080/09592296.2016.1169791', '10.5612/slavicreview.71.4.0873', '10.1080/00905992.2012.742990', '10.1111/russ.10718', '10.26530/OAPEN_474310', '10.4324/9780429465543-16', '10.1057/9781137367983_6', '10.1057/9780230554931', '10.1177/0002716207311699', '10.1007/978-981-13-9427-0_7', '10.1007/978-3-319-63163-9_10', '10.1016/0378-8733(95)00253-K', '10.3384/cu.2000.1525.1608165', '10.21428/66f840a4.b16a85d1']",SAGE Publications

Gordimer adds that the short story is “a fragmented and restless form, a matter of hit or miss, and it is perhaps for this reason that it suits modern consciousness” (170–71). Taking its cue from Gordimer’s remarks, this article attempts to examine the genre of the short story through the lens of the literary prize industry in Africa. In most parts of the continent the development of the short story, like that of the novel and other genres, has been slow, facing a number of challenges such as a historically impoverished publishing industry. The rise in popularity of the local and global literary prize for the short story has however played a significant role in the promotion of the genre and literature generally on the continent. The article examines the short story’s increased presence in the digital space and interrogates the general assumption on the part of many of the prize-awarding bodies that the short story can be linked to African oral traditions. The aim of the article is to explore the relationship between the genre and the rising popularity of the literary prize on the continent, focusing on the various ways in which the prize is (re)shaping the contemporary African short story.&#x0D; Keywords: Orality, literary prize, publishing, exoticism, literary fracture, disconnectivity","[('Doseline Kiguru', '')]",[],African Journals Online (AJOL)

It is argued that the phrase goes back to the New Testament and is associated with Biblical ideas of timeless values.

Khodasevich’s poem and his collection bearing the same title are a convenient starting point for elucidating this poetical myth. The article considers its development in the lyrics by Alexander Pushkin and Nikolay Nekrasov, as well as its transformation in the poetry of the Symbolists. Special emphasis is laid on the lyrics of the Peasant Poets and their responses to the Revolution of 1917. In the light of the article’s topic, the poems of the Peasant Poets feature the myth with very high intensity.

Despite the increased attention of researchers to ""Vremya"" and ""Epokha"" in recent decades, many questions remain unresolved: the editorial and royalty policy of journals and the financial side of the publication have not been sufficiently studied, the key problem of attribution of anonymous and pseudonymous journal articles has not been fully resolved, i.e., in regard to the co-authorship and editorial work of F.

This paper analyses in a broad way the stages and frameworks in which these public policies on the status of Catalan have taken place. Until the end of the eighties, a linguistic normalization approach predominated, focusing on the creation of a legal and institutional framework that would allow the process of linguistic substitution to be reversed. The need for general language planning became apparent at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, but since the end of this last decade, the central idea has been the politics of language. More recently, the changes induced by the process of globalization have led to a perspective focused on linguistic sustainability, which has gained ground in the early 21st century. After the judgment 31/2010 of the Spanish Constitutional Court on the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, Spain’s policies have been particularly adverse to Catalan. Without a coordinated action of the Catalan-speaking territories being able to overcome the current subordination, the future of Catalan is uncertain.","[('Isidor Marí', 'Open University of Catalonia'), ('Isidor Marí', 'Institute of Catalan Studies')]",['10.1057/9780230302426'],John Benjamins Publishing Company

Medieval medical theories, rooted in classical thought, emphasise the bodily spirits and in particular, the ways that motions of the ‘vital spirit’—closely connected with breath—cause powerful physical responses that write emotions on the body in sighs, swoons, and even death. Physiological theory was complemented by theological notions of pneuma, the Spirit of divinity and life. The movement of breath plays a key role in depictions of emotion from love to grief, and in visionary or mystical experience. This essay explores breath and breathlessness in a range of English secular and devotional literary texts: popular romance writing, the medically alert fictions of Chaucer, and visionary works including the Revelations of Divine Love of Julian of Norwich and the spiritual autobiography of Margery Kempe. In all these works, concepts of the vital spirits and the role of breath in emotion are central. The play of breath underpins and shapes depictions of romantic love, explorations of the boundary between life and death, and ideas of spiritual revelation, creating narratives of profoundly embodied, affective experience.","[('Corinne Saunders', '')]","['10.1017/CCOL9780521853439', '10.1515/9781400822676', '10.1093/0199266387.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9780511518737', '10.9783/9780812296082', '10.7208/chicago/9780226761312.001.0001']",Springer International Publishing

Scholarship cannot, however, easily claim Metham's lyric as the first English sonnet: contrary to past suggestions, available historical and manuscript evidence indicates that he did not intentionally create a sonnet, but rather composed in the form accidentally. This inset lyric's rhyme scheme therefore represents, possibly uniquely in English, sonnet form without the sonnet tradition. Despite this isolation, however, attentive reading shows that the lyric achieves certain effects very like those produced by later English sonnets. The common features underpinning these effects even in a text not knowingly written as a sonnet might help criticism isolate factors that make up form's essence or quiddity.","[('Daniel Sawyer', 'Merton College, University of Oxford, Oxford, England, (daniel.sawyer@ell.ox.ac.uk)')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

Both fields deal with dynamic systems, such as living organisms or machines that move, change and respond to the environment. It might therefore be expected that the metaphors used to research and communicate biological, genetic or genomic phenomena might take inspiration from cybernetics. Molecular biology was indeed inspired by cybernetics, but, surprisingly, the most popular metaphors used for research and communication were rooted in older fields of human endeavour, such as the Morse code, printing and machines. Such metaphors tended to foreground static and product aspects of biological phenomena, rather than dynamic and process ones. This made it difficult to talk widely about complexity, flexibility and dynamics, all aspects of biology (and cybernetics) that were well-known and well-studied. Modern-day biologists have noted this discrepancy between their research and the language used to talk about it, and are now calling for a new language, inspired amongst others by cybernetics, a language that, it is hoped, might capture the dynamic aspects of biology which some of the older metaphors tended to hide. In this article I survey (some of) the history of metaphors from the 1940s to 2019, focusing on the metaphors of the code (and information), the book and the machine. I attempt to show that cybernetics, although influencing the emergence of molecular biology, failed to inspire popular metaphors. Will modern biologists, taking inspiration from cybernetics to create not only a new science but also a new language, be more successful in this enterprise?","[('Brigitte Nerlich', '')]",[],Edinburgh University Press

This is the first detailed study of his life and literary legacy. His most important works are the short play Haft (1921), the political crime study Der Mord am Polizeiagenten Blau (1924), and the novel Gott, Gegenwart und Kokain (1927). He took part in the Munich revolution of 1919 and was co‐editor of the Munich cultural‐revolutionary journal Der Weg. He served a prison sentence for helping Ernst Toller to escape lynching. After moving to Berlin, he completed his medical studies, worked as an editor for the publishing houses of Kiepenheuer and Die Schmiede, and became a leading figure in the ‘Novembergruppe’ and ‘Gruppe 1925’. A dark but gregarious person, he was a regular presence at the ‘Romanisches Café’, where he was known as a ‘father‐confessor’ to the artists there. In 1930, after a controversial relationship with the French writer Colette Peignot, aka Laure, he withdrew from literary life, finding his way to Mallorca, England and, eventually, Australia, where he achieved distinction as a biomedical researcher with pioneering studies on the psychopharmacology of lithium.","[('Wes Wallace', 'Dublin'), ('Christa Steinle', 'Graz')]",[],Wiley
10.15393/j10.art.2020.4541,NEIZVESTNYI DOSTOEVSKII-THE UNKNOWN DOSTOEVSKY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Dostoevsky's Siberian Routes,[],"The article examines the routes Dostoevsky had followed from St. Petersburg to Siberia and back, and his travels through Siberia in 1850—1859. This task required a historically accurate reconstruction of Dostoevsky’s Siberian routes: Semipalatinsk—Zmiev, Semipalatinsk—Barnaul, Semipalatinsk—Zmiev—Barnaul—Kuznetsk, Semipalatinsk—Loktev plant. The article also describes the condition of the roads, indicates their length and intermediate stations, which allows to identify the writer’s Siberian routes, clarify the details of his travels, their duration and dates. The length of the routes is revealed by the &lt;i&gt;Postal Road Atlas of the Russian Empire&lt;/i&gt; dated 1829, 1852 and 1875, topographic maps of Tomsk province, reference works, memoirs of contemporaries and the author’s collection of letters. The study revealed that the length of the road from Semipalatinsk to Zmeinogorsk is 182.5 versts (&lt;i&gt;Postal Road Atlas&lt;/i&gt;, 1829) or 201 versts (1875); Zmeinogorsk—Barnaul — 280 (1825) or 268.75 (1875) versts. Thus, the total length of the Semipalatinsk—Zmiev—Barnaul route is equal to 462.5 versts (1825) or 469.75 versts (1875). There were two roads between Barnaul and Kuznetsk: the first one, the north road, passed through Kisluha—Beloyarsk—Golubtsovo—Kopylovo, Sorokino, Yanovskoe, Monoskino, Khmelevsky, Salairsky Pereval, Gavrilovsky Silver Smelter Plant, Gurievsk, Bachata, Karagayly, Bangur; and the second one, the south road, shorter and more direct, passed through Togul and the Tomsk plant. Only the second road is mentioned in the &lt;i&gt;Postal Road Atlas&lt;/i&gt;. The article provides the calculation of the span of each road, and substantiates the hypothesis that Dostoevsky’s Barnaul-Kuznetsk route passed through Gobina, Zilina, Kosikha, Losishikha (Losisha), Togul’skoye village, Togul’skoye Zimov’ye, Tomsk iron plant, Berezovka and spanned 282—282.5 versts. Indirect evidence of the fact that the writer took this road are the memoirs of A. E. Vrangel and Dostoevsky’s letters. For instance, in the letters to V. M. Karepina and the writer’s elder brother (both dated 22 December 1856), Dostoevsky mentions 700—750 versts between Semipalatinsk and Kuznetsk. A comparison between topographic maps of the ХIХ century and the author’s letters allows us to revise the viewpoint of E. R. Vesterman, who insisted on the distance of 1,000 verst-route between Semipalatinsk and Kuznetsk through Salair, Guryevsk, Bachata, Karagayly, Kiselevsk, Kalachevo and Bungur.

As a result of the conducted research, a hypothetical chain of events was built. In 1838 (1835, according to other sources), Dostoevsky was impressed by “Mary Stuart” at the Alexandrinsky Theater with A. M. Karatygina in the title role: the image of the suffering queen created by the actress was superimposed on the reading of both Schiller’s tragedy “Mary Stuart” and Walter Scott’s novel “The Abbot.” Russian collection of her biographical documents, published in 1809 and the 1839 French-Russian edition of letters of Mary Stuart, her will and the report on the execution discovered by A. Ya. Lobanov-Rostovsky in the archives, came into the view of the novice writer when he was studying the “historical data” about the “life and execution” of Mary Stuart. In 1839–1840, a fictionalized biography of the “criminal” queen, compiled by Alexandre Dumas, was published. In his version, the image of Mary Stuart is twofold: along with the heroic beginning of the character, the theme of sinful passion emerged. The bifurcation of the image was reinforced in the 1841 essay by Filaret Shal, who also emphasized the religious motives of the unfolding historical drama. Comprehending all these turns of European and Russian historiography in 1839–1842, Dostoevsky could use as the basis of his play the dialogue of the nurse and Mary in the fourth scene of the first act of his tragedy about the correlation between guilt and responsibility, which Schiller did not continue. For Schiller, Mary Stuart is the title character, but not the only main one, moreover, the theme of Elizabeth in many ways attracted dramatic interest. Dostoevsky most likely focused on the internal collisions of the “gigantic character,” whom he placed in a line of Racine’s heroines (first of all, the “Shakespearean essay” by Phaedra): Maria integrated the firmness of spirit in the face of suffering and death itself with the omnipotence of passion, accompanied by torments of conscience. The “historical data” that Riesenkampf hinted at, mastered by the Russian author, allowed to continue Schiller’s creative work. The article identifies and analyzes a range of these data thatrevealed the deep collisions of European history embodied in one of its iconic characters to Dostoevsky.","[('Vladimir Viktorovich', '')]",[],Petrozavodsk State University

Amateur play suddenly brought so many literary works to three-dimensional life—and all at once. Despite their amusements, however, the carnivals also fell short of loftier goals. First, organizers sought to advance a definitive literary canon in America, but they only affirmed Eurocentric texts that no longer dominated the marketplace. Second, the events might have produced an innovative form of theater, yet clumsy staging and spectatorial disorientation stymied these efforts. Thus, the authors’ carnivals left behind not only a legacy of spectacular fandom but also one of squandered cultural potential.US authors’ carnivals finally demonstrate[d] both the possibilities and the shortcomings of the nineteenth-century cultural imagination. . . . [D]espite their estimable amusements . . . the carnivals ultimately proved resistant to the literary and theatrical cultures they intended to bolster.","[('Michael D’Alessandro', '')]","['10.1017/CBO9781107050822', '10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780195385359.003.0011', '10.36019/9780813594743', '10.1525/boom.2012.2.2.22', '10.2307/j.ctt20h6v34', '10.9783/9780812206180', '10.1017/CCOL0521660033.011', '10.1017/CHOL9780521899079.007']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

I demonstrate how experimental modernism and biomedical development both deploy and resist evolving classifications of mental life. These underappreciated cultural dialogues generate authoritative models of cognitive and corporeal health determined by race and gender. I take up four such medicalized types and establish how these pathologized figures embody anxieties about social change, particularly related to race, gender, and sexuality. Synthesizing literary fiction with transatlantic medical discourse and computational methods with traditional archival practices, this project rethinks the cultural politics at work in biological schemas of wellness and disorder, while highlighting the stumbling blocks of interpretive practices shared by the sciences and the arts.","[('Lisa Mendelman', '')]","['10.1002/9781444302790', '10.1017/9781108284035', '10.2307/804321', '10.1353/elh.2020.0011', '10.1215/08992363-2144688', '10.1515/9781400830855']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The encounter between this emerging literature in the Francophone field on racial capitalism, and the pioneering work of Étienne Balibar and Immanuel Wallerstein on race, class, and nation helps to uncover how contemporary border practices around the world—and particularly in France—rely on the dichotomies of ""legal"" and ""illegal,"" ""useful/chosen,"" and ""deportable"" migrants, even though these dichotomies do not serve the sole criterion of economic productivity.","[('Hourya Bentouhami', '')]",[],Project MUSE

Taken together, Jason Frank’s The Democratic Sublime (2021), Andrés Fabián Henao Castro’s Antigone in the Americas (2021), Michael Steinberg’s The Afterlife of Moses (2022), and Elisabeth Anker’s Ugly Freedoms (2022) suggest that the aesthetic turn in democratic theory most closely associated with the work of Jacques Rancière has been decisive. But if democratic theorists now fully embrace the centrality of creativity, performative assembly, and affective attachment and aversion to democratic renewal, they do not fully agree on the more fundamental question of whether democracy is a stable form that has aesthetic features or whether it is constitutively aesthetic—in other words, whether its people comes into being in moments of materialization with no prior referent.If contemporary political theorists . . . have found better prospects for the revitalization of democratic politics in collective performance and creative resistance than in . . . legal and political institutions, this shows how seriously . . . democratic thought has come to take democracy’s aesthetic dimensions.","[('Jennifer Greiman', '')]","['10.1215/9781478022404', '10.2307/jj.18253066', '10.1215/9780822391685', '10.1093/oso/9780190658151.001.0001', '10.1515/9781503632301']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Nuestra hipótesis es que el texto fue escrito entre los siglos XIII y XVI. Por lo tanto, la base teórica está constituida por gramáticas históricas de la lengua española que traen las siguientes características representativas del español medieval que nos permitieran elaborar criterios para el análisis que comprobarían o no la hipótesis inicial: 1) la formación de adverbios con el sufijo -mientre; 2) los masculinos hechos en -a que adoptan concordancia femenina; 3) la aspiración de la f- inicial; 4) el cambio de la copulativa et para y; 4) el adverbio suso. Los resultados permiten observar que la lengua del manuscrito fecha probablemente de finales del siglo XIV o del siglo XV, lo que se encuentra de acuerdo con las hipótesis de autoría propuestas por los trabajos acerca del Lybro de magyka hasta el momento. Así, el presente estudio contribuye para la reconstrucción de la historia del códice y para los estudios acerca de la lengua española. The objective of this work is to identify the approximate date of the production of the text of the manuscript Lybro de magyka, the third part of a work on astrology, in Spanish, purchased by Hernando Colón in 1527, which is preserved today in the Biblioteca Colombina, Seville, Spain, under the registration Ms. 5-2-32. Our hypothesis is that the text was written between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries, and is a copy of a Catalan translation. Therefore, the theoretical basis is constituted by works of internal and external history of the Spanish language that bring representative characteristics of the medieval Spanish. The characteristics below allow to elaborate criteria for the analysis that would verify or not the initial hypothesis: 1) the formation of adverbs with the suffix -mientre ; 2) the masculine ones made in -a that adopt feminine concordance; 3) the change of the copulative et to y; The results show that the language of the manuscript probably dates from the fifteenth century, which is in accordance with the hypotheses of authorship proposed by the works on the Lybro de Magyka so far. Thus, the present study contributes to the reconstruction of the history of the codex and to the studies about the Spanish language.","[('Duchowny Aléxia', ''), ('Pereira Luíza', '')]",[],Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia

It employs the perspective of the small state literature to analyse the activities of a small European Union (EU) member state’s government that had to face a mismatch between its policy priorities and policy framing at the EU and domestic level. The article focuses on the arguably common situation of a small state’s government failing to shape a policy internationally and facing a backlash at home. On the basis of a qualitative study of primary and secondary sources as well as semi-structured interviews, the article explores how the Czech debate on GDPR prioritised the bureaucratic burden and costs resulting from the GDPR implementation over the need for privacy as an integral part of human dignity highlighted at the EU level. The article identifies two crucial factors as the basis of the popular backlash against GDPR in Czechia, the lack of prioritisation and the insufficient bureaucratic capacity. These two factors, widely identified in the literature as factors influencing small states’ performance, contributed to the Czech inability to shape GDPR at the European level, as well as the lacking information campaign and implementation domestically.","[('Lucie Kadlecová', 'Charles University, Czechia'), ('Tomáš Weiss', 'Charles University, Czechia')]","['10.1111/1468-5965.00260', '10.1057/9780230246911_2', '10.1080/23340460.2017.1410721', '10.1080/13501760701702272', '10.1111/1468-5965.00351', '10.1057/9780230234345', '10.1080/01402382.2018.1510195', '10.1080/21599165.2016.1221817', '10.1080/02684527.2014.988444', '10.1177/0010836711406417', '10.1080/13501760010014902', '10.54648/BULA1992101', '10.1109/NaNA.2019.00008', '10.1057/palgrave.cep.6110023', '10.1515/9781685853372', '10.1111/j.1468-5965.2008.01833.x', '10.1017/eis.2017.20', '10.1111/j.1743-8594.2010.00108.x', '10.1080/09557571.2016.1242556', '10.1017/S0143814X10000152', '10.1023/A:1008603019881', '10.1080/13501763.2011.544490', '10.30950/jcer.v6i2.264', '10.1080/09557571.2012.710579', '10.1080/09557571.2012.710590', '10.1177/0952076715581540', '10.1080/13533312.2014.938580', '10.1080/13501763.2012.662072', '10.1080/09557570802253435', '10.1162/002081800551109', '10.1080/1570585018458754', '10.1111/j.1468-5965.2008.00798.x', '10.1016/S1353-4858(16)30056-3', '10.1080/09557570601003502', '10.4324/9781315798042-1']",SAGE Publications

Heeding research on debunking and pre-bunking strategies recognizing the limitations and potential of these approaches in inoculating populations against disinformation, this paper examines how several tactics deployed in the CEE region can both speak to and draw from this literature. While certain segments of CEE populations may be vulnerable to disinformation, the region also boasts civically engaged publics that want to take an active part in fostering societal resilience. The rise of digital elves (volunteer information warriors taking the fight to online trolls), the outsourcing of counter-disinformation activities to popular public institutions (like the police and military), and the use of crowdfunding to support news literacy education and independent media outlets present compelling alternative strategies towards responding to foreign influence. These activities show promise in overcoming obstacles faced by conventional approaches to disinformation and addressing CEE-specific issues related to media distrust and state capture of the media.","[('Shane Markowitz', 'Comenius University, Slovakia')]","['10.1080/21599165.2019.1662398', '10.18352/ulr.420', '10.1080/09546553.2019.1693370', '10.1371/journal.pone.0175799', '10.1080/13600826.2020.1839387', '10.1007/978-3-319-90506-8', '10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.11.037', '10.1080/01972243.2017.1391913', '10.1111/jasp.12453', '10.1146/annurev-publhealth-090419-102409', '10.1080/10463283.2021.1876983', '10.1177/1529100612451018', '10.1080/21507740.2020.1740351', '10.1080/0963928021000031466', '10.3233/978-1-61499-943-0-75', '10.1080/10511253.2011.590512', '10.1007/s10796-021-10240-7', '10.1080/1060586X.2022.2061817', '10.1111/pops.12586', '10.1093/heapro/daab140', '10.3109/01421599609034145', '10.1002/gch2.201600008', '10.1177/0163443720906992', '10.1177/1461444820908530', '10.5688/ajpe75228']",SAGE Publications
10.1093/alh/ajab078,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Criticism on the Border and the Decolonization of Knowledge,[],"AbstractStructures of hierarchy and domination are never represented in transborder literature as singular effects of social conditions. Instead, they arise from multiple historical factors. Unlike writings that assume a racial binary, literature on the border does not posit one kind of domination and hierarchy as barriers to creating a just, democratic society. In recent literary works from the transborder regions, the yearning for justice within the layered social systems on the border is central, even while its attainment through social transformation remains an attenuated hope. This essay outlines a paradigm for studying the relations between global and local areas of study, such as those in the transborder regions of the Americas. Invoking models for literary critical work in a globally bordered form, it posits the need for a larger view based on how knowledge is generated and human resources used, while acknowledging the reservoir of knowledge that exists beyond Europe and the US in the Global South. The function of the rebordered criticism described here is to respond to issues raised by African philosopher Achille Mbembe, Latin American sociologist Enrique Dussel and other decolonial thinkers concerning different ways of conceiving the achievement of an antiracist and socially just future.In the face of [the] compromised hopefulness [for justice on the border], what kind of criticism could best [respond to and] … help enact projects of social change?","[('Ramón Saldívar', '')]",['10.1515/9781685859183'],Oxford University Press (OUP)

The novel was not to focus on Roppolo, but its origin in the poem McCarthy quotes suggests that the tragic theme of creative potential spoiled or unfulfilled was central to it, and that originally the domain of creativity may have been artistic rather than scientific. Biographical influences that may also inform McCarthy's early thinking about the novel include his familiarity with three men he met in Ibiza in the late 1960s, art forger Elmyr de Hory and writers Clifford Irving and Leslie Garrett, all of whom followed paths that undermined their artistic potential.","[('Dianne C.

Its basis as defined in this paper is the minimal ›one-word formula‹ along with its diverse morpho-syntactical extensions. The approach taken in this study identifies ›one-word-formulas‹ such as alu or laukaR as the basic building blocks of runic formulaicity which can be extended in various ways. The typology thus established comprises 1. monolexemes consisting of isolated charm words, e. g., alu, 2. reduplication formulas, e. g., salu-salu, 3. twin formulas, e. g., līna laukaR, 4. alliterative non-twin formulas, e. g., rūnō raginakundō, 5. tandem formulas and further combinations of formulas, e. g., laukaR alu, and 6. disguised and distorted formulas, e. g., tua , which probably can stand for alu. The methodological foundation of this overall classification lies in the linguistic and rhythmic-metrical principles that these formulas obey, not least Behaghel’s Fourth Law.","[('Michael Schulte', 'Universitet i Agder Universitetsveien 25 Kristiansand Norwegen')]",[],Walter de Gruyter GmbH

In the context of recent theorizations of scholarly composing with comics and an intensification of self-reflexivity within the Affective Turn, I read Gallardo and Roca’s play on the early ‘voyages and travels’ genre as a means of harnessing its powers of scientific and intellectual enquiry to comment on image/ text representations of cognitive disability, and of theorizing from early on about the changing landscape of comics in twenty-first-century Spain.","[('JENNIFER NAGTEGAAL', '')]","['10.3167/eca.2018.110206', '10.1080/14753820.2021.1956172']",Liverpool University Press

Chronic crisis narration dislodges the narrative modes and epistemological frames of modern crisis scenarios: crisis no longer designates the experience of a decisive tipping point after a climactic build-up but rather an enduring state of extremity, requiring uninterrupted resilience. The chronic crisis novel experiments with anthropologically inflected modes of narration to articulate the subjective and social experience of precarity, exhaustion, and the depletion of resources. However, by aesthetically reclaiming precariousness as the domain of relationality and pleasure, this genre also explores the idea of the “good-enough life” as a viable alternative to the middle-class expectation of the good life.","[('Anne Fuchs', 'University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland')]","['10.1515/9781571138897', '10.1515/9780773577152', '10.1515/9783110282955.33', '10.30965/9783846743188', '10.1353/jhi.2006.0013', '10.1515/9781503619104-008', '10.1007/978-3-319-52887-8', '10.30965/9783846743188_005', '10.1515/9783110282955.59', '10.5699/modelangrevi.112.1.0205', '10.30965/9783846743188_003', '10.5040/9781472510631']",University of Toronto Press Inc.

10.1093/alh/ajaa037,AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Character: Three Inquiries in Literary Studies,[],"Abstract A prominent strand of literary criticism today assumes that literature as literature is not significant enough to merit critical scrutiny. Instead of attending to the features that distinguish literature from everyday expression, this criticism values literature for its closeness to and reflection of life. Different as they might appear in their subject matter and approach, Character, The Disposition of Nature, and None Like Us share this “literature-as-life” orientation. In Character, Toril Moi, Rita Felski, and Amanda Anderson remind us of the pleasures of identification, embracing the layperson’s native inclination to consider “characters as objects of identification, sources of emotional response, or agents of moral vision and behavior” (4). Blending life writing with cultural criticism, Stephen Best uses his own narrative to attempt to rewrite the “‘traumatic model of black history’ in which the present is merely an endless, Oedipal repetition of slavery and Jim Crow” (6). Instead of the presence of an identity founded on this never-ending circuit of remembrance and despair, Best wants to dwell in impossibility, contradiction, paradox, and in-betweenness. Jennifer Wenzel’s study, The Disposition of Nature, blends paraphrases of literary representations of real-world environmental problems with references to political and cultural theories and to historical and journalistic accounts. In Wenzel’s case studies on such things as the story of oil extraction in the Niger Delta, the lifelikeness of literature engenders a meditative kind of outrage and skepticism. Given the fact that literary critics are no more expert in life than are their readers, the literature-as-life orientation shared by these authors leads to a kind of critical self-destruction.","[('Gregg Crane', '')]","['10.7208/chicago/9780226658834.001.0001', '10.1215/9781478002581']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

This brutalist icon, designed in the 1950s by Marcel Breuer, was recently abandoned by its original inhabitants.

In this special section, we posit the building as a prism through which we probe the connections between art, architecture and international law. In line with the tradition of (re)invention embodied by Breuer’s design, the section breathes experimentation. The contributions are eclectic, unconventional and rough round the edges. The section is structured as a route through the building with no particular order or hierarchy. The ‘façade’ functions as a somewhat natural starting point, thereafter, the reader is invited to choose her own route.

10.1215/00358118-8007992,ROMANIC REVIEW,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,Bruno Latour and the Loving Assumptions of [REL],[],"AbstractIn An Inquiry into the Modes of Existence, which addresses itself to the profound challenge of how to “compose” a common world in the Anthropocene, Bruno Latour proposes that the mode of religion [REL] offers a model for all the others—that of reprise. Emerging from the practice of biblical exegesis, reprise refers to an open-ended process of meaning making opposed to the rigid certainties of fundamentalism. [REL] also contributes a concept of radical transformation through love (“conversion”). For Latour, two events from the Virgin Mary’s life—the Annunciation and the Assumption—illustrate reprise and conversion, both of which are necessary in coming to terms with monogeism, the knowledge that there is only one world. This essay examines Latour’s proposed relationship between reprise and conversion through a consideration of late medieval Marian devotion. Focusing on vernacular accounts of Mary’s Assumption, it argues that reprise leads to violent as well as loving conversions; indeed, violence can proceed in the name of love. The essay concludes that composition, reprise, and conversion come together in ways that trouble late medieval accounts of the Assumption, the mode of religion, and life in the Anthropocene.","[('Anke Bernau', 'The University of Manchester')]","['10.2307/2928707', '10.1111/1468-2265.00202', '10.9783/9780812293630', '10.1515/9781400842056', '10.1002/9780470998434.ch6', '10.1353/nlh.2010.a408295', '10.1177/0306312712470751', '10.1093/oso/9780199256044.001.0001', '10.1086/421123', '10.1017/CBO9780511519697', '10.1353/cdr.1991.0029', '10.7829/9789639776364Rubin', '10.3998/mpub.9736', '10.1558/poth.v12i4.511']",Duke University Press

Derived from the Greek “oikos” meaning “house, dwelling place, habitation,” ecology points to the embodiment of lived experience and knowledge‐making in the “Oyoyo” tracks. Drawing on Audre Lorde's “Poetry is not a luxury” and the concept of Black joy, I demonstrate how these tracks promote varying understandings of diasporic homecoming and construct sonic ecologies in which Megaloh's and Akinyi's Germanness and Blackness are rendered compatible.","[('Adrienne Merritt', 'University of Colorado, Boulder')]","['10.1215/9780822392781', '10.1075/pbns.110.11ber', '10.1017/CCO9781139775298.027', '10.1215/10418385-3822457', '10.1080/17528631.2015.1027326', '10.1111/j.0953-5233.2003.00316.x', '10.5406/j.ctv1f884c1', '10.3138/seminar.54.4.002', '10.1017/CCO9781139775298.003', '10.7208/chicago/9780226496351.001.0001', '10.1177/1367549409105366', '10.1215/9780822373452', '10.1515/9781571138347', '10.1515/culture-2019-0023']",Wiley

This paper focusses on whether this inhibiting effect can be demonstrated at the perception level and whether it has an effect in the linguistic behaviour of bilinguals. To examine these effects, we conducted an identification experiment with three groups of listeners (Majorcan Catalan-dominant bilinguals, Spanish-dominant bilinguals and a control group of Spanish monolinguals). Results show that Catalan dominants do recognise [ʎ] stimuli, but Spanish dominants only identify [ʎ] at chance level. Consequently, it would seem that bilingual subjects display a bimodal performance at the perception level.","[('Assumpció Rost Bagudanch', 'Universitat de les Illes Balears , Facultat de Filosofia i Lletres (edifici Ramon Llull) , ctra. de Valldemossa , km. 7,5, Palma de Mallorca Spain')]","['10.1177/1367006914544988', '10.1017/S0022226708005331', '10.1017/S0025100305002148', '10.1017/CBO9780511486357', '10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00828', '10.1075/hsm.8.08cor', '10.1016/j.cognition.2009.10.001', '10.1075/la.159.05enr', '10.4067/S0718-93032016000200003', '10.31819/9783954870691', '10.1016/j.wocn.2005.10.001', '10.1075/dia.30.2.04hua', '10.1016/j.wocn.2009.10.001', '10.1017/S0954394500000442', '10.1075/hsm.7.11lle', '10.1037/0096-1523.31.5.912', '10.1075/cilt.323.05oha', '10.1075/tsl.45.08pie', '10.31819/9783865278630-007', '10.1177/1367006916688334', '10.3989/loquens.2014.010', '10.1515/flin-2017-0005', '10.1515/zrp-2019-0025', '10.1159/000381067', '10.1002/9780470757024.ch22', '10.1002/9781118228098.ch37', '10.1353/jsl.2013.0013', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935345.013.72', '10.31819/9783954870691-002', '10.1075/dia.22.2.05win']",Walter de Gruyter GmbH
10.3138/seminar.56.2.4,SEMINAR-A JOURNAL OF GERMANIC STUDIES,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"Bildung, Negative Exceptionalism, and the End of Genealogy in Robert Walser's Jakob von Gunten",[],"Focusing on the servant, this article analyzes figurations of disobedience in Robert Walser’s novel Jakob von Gunten (1909) in dialogue with formal genre conventions. Jakob von Gunten: Ein Tagebuch presents itself as the diary of the eponymous protagonist who, at the beginning of the twentieth century, enters a school for servants in Berlin to break with his aristocratic lineage. In contrast to the narrative arc of the Bildungsroman and Entwicklungsroman that envisages self-realization through progressive education, the novel abandons teleological emplotment in favour of the performance of servility. Rather than embracing the Enlightenment program of self-realization through learning and experience, Jakob overtly champions a downward career in defiance of both his aristocratic origins and developmental progress. However, this article demonstrates that, in the context of modernity, his role play as a quasi-feudal servant stages negative exceptionalism as a new form of perfection: Jakob wants to turn into “eine reizende kugelrunde Null” precisely because this zero position without value generates absolute agency. The analysis of the formal features of Jakob’s diary entries complements the thematic exploration of his escapades, dreams, and fantasies, which often stage an aggrandized and omnipotent alter ego. In so doing, I show that the performance of disobedience in Walser’s novel articulates an exclusive and elusive subjectivity.","[('Anne Fuchs', 'University College Dublin')]","['10.7591/cornell/9780801451775.001.0001', '10.1080/00168890.2013.842871', '10.1007/978-3-476-04101-2', '10.1515/9781400871315', '10.1111/j.1756-1183.2006.tb00045.x']",University of Toronto Press Inc.

Drawing on the conceptualization of register as a continuum (Briz Gómez 2010), in the following pages we examine an unpublished bilingual corpus consisting of conversations in daily routine contexts. The analysis of the data reveals that the situational features are highly colloquial in the interactions studied, and shows a specific display of the following parameters: control on language production, lexical in/accuracy, deixis, un/familiar treatment, syntax, extra/linguistic contextualization and tone. In conclusion, this qualitative study sheds light on the language used in conversations in reality television and lays the foundation to consider Big Brother an adequate corpus for analyzing colloquial register in both languages.","[('Pau Bertomeu Pi', '')]",[],Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)

10.3366/jobs.2020.0282,JOURNAL OF BECKETT STUDIES,0502 Foreign Language and Literature; 1303 Drama Film and Television,Beckettian Pedagogies: Learning through Samuel Beckett,[],"This essay considers what it might mean to learn ‘through’ Beckett, inaugurating a critical pedagogy that could be called ‘Beckettian’. By integrating existing strands of scholarship on Beckett and his relationship to education, the essay draws a distinction between the ‘practical’ and ‘biographical’ ways of thinking about Beckett and learning. This draws on previous work within the field, but also proposes a new vocabulary – derived from an interdisciplinary encounter with the scholarship of teaching and learning and the philosophy of education, especially ‘critical pedagogy’ – through which the possibility of ‘Beckettian pedagogies’ might be manifested. Recalling Beckett's biographers, his work's fundamental silence haunts most attempts to contain, explain, avoid or domesticate it. The essay proposes that a critical pedagogy of Beckett must be grounded in the concept of openness, especially in the notion that ‘void’ is a productive category, and in the embodiment of an evolving ecology of praxis. This alternative pathway reflects on the philosophy of education inherent within Beckett as an idea, engaging with ‘Beckettian pedagogies’ in an entangled sense of instruction, guidance and teaching with a particular focus on the latter in terms of the theory or principles of education. This move does not require abandoning existing traditions, but rather gathering them under new light, by placing the biographical Beckett (1906–89) in juxtaposition with the praxis of Beckett (ongoing) and the contemporaneous notion of critical pedagogy, as expounded by several scholars including Paulo Freire (1921–97). Beckettian pedagogies therefore remove dormant assumptions, habits of mind, and hierarchies that impede exploration to enable a move away from the curriculum, or toward a curriculum of unlearning and uncertainty, thereby disrupting the entrenched powers that Beckett saw fit to resist.","[('Jonathan Heron', ''), ('Nicholas Johnson', '')]","['10.2307/1208787', '10.4324/9780203846179', '10.1007/s10912-016-9383-7', '10.26530/OAPEN_595042', '10.1177/105382590502800205', '10.1016/j.nedt.2019.05.012', '10.3366/jobs.2014.0083', '10.1017/CBO9781107587977', '10.1007/978-1-4020-8224-5', '10.5040/9781472511072', '10.47925/2013.053', '10.1017/CBO9780511607417', '10.1017/CCOL0521413664.011', '10.1080/10486801.2017.1405393', '10.1017/9781108284011', '10.1017/CCOL0521413664', '10.23987/sts.61030', '10.3366/jobs.2018.0225', '10.1162/0011526054622015', '10.1007/978-3-319-20786-5', '10.1215/9780822385318', '10.1016/j.nedt.2019.03.014', '10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.11.005', '10.1007/s11217-005-1287-3']",Edinburgh University Press

Dostoevsky was one of the first female collectors in Russia. The article examines her collecting activities, which included collecting postage stamps and autographs of world historical figures, based on archival sources. The motivation and support for this undertaking were provided by the writer himself, and the ""suppliers"" were his correspondents and acquaintances. The article focuses on autographs in Italian in the collection of A. G. Dostoevskaya, which are stored at the department of manuscripts of the Russian State Library. These are five undated letters of famous Italians received from A. N. Jacobi (Peshkova-Toliverova), who lived in Italy in the 1860s and had a wide social circle there. A. N. Jacobi had been familiar with the Dostoevskys since the mid-1870s, and continued to communicate with Anna Grigorievna even after the writer's death. Among the documents handed over to A. N. Jacobi are a letter from the poet Aleardo Aleardi to the artist Guglielmo de Sanctis, a letter addressed to her from the Italian opera singer Elisa Volpini, politician Ricciotti Garibaldi (son of J. Garibaldi) and two letters from the Italian actor Ernesto Rossi. The sixth autograph in Italian in the collection of A. G. Dostoevsky is a letter to her from a fan of Dostoevsky’s work by the Sardinian writer Grazia Deledda in 1912. In this letter, the future winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature expressed her admiration and love for the ""powerful genius"" Dostoevsky. Grazia Deledda not only communicated in writing with Dostoevsky's widow, but also met with his daughter Lyubov in Italy in the 1910s. The article introduces unique letters in Italian from the collection of A. G. Dostoevskaya into scientific circulation for the first time, and provides their translation into Russian.

The analysis begins with an outline of the representation of trees on stage to continue with a ‘close reading’ of the mentioned plays, clearly distinguishing individual trees from woods and forests. Individual types of trees may represent death, sadness, sorcery and premonitions, or serve as meeting places, while forests and woods are frequently portrayed as settings which create an atmosphere of confusion, false appearances, danger and magic. This reflects a long-standing historical connection between trees and forests and the supernatural in literature and culture. However, while individual trees largely reflect traditional symbology, conventional interpretations are often subverted in Shakespeare’s treatment of forests and woods. From all this we may infer that Shakespeare was not only familiar with the traditions associated to individual tree species and forests in general, but also that he made conscious and active use of these in order to enhance the meaning of an action, reinforce character traits, further the plot and create a specific atmosphere. More subtly, the collective arboreal environments can also be interpreted as spaces in which superstitions and older societal models are questioned in favour of a more rational and reasonable understanding of the world.","[('Andoni Cossio', ''), ('Martin Simonson', '')]","['10.1017/9781139015257', '10.1201/9780429297755-69', '10.4324/9780203300770', '10.4324/9780203806838', '10.1163/9789401203555_002', '10.2307/j.ctvc77h3r', '10.1002/9781118326770', '10.5962/bhl.title.112024', '10.1086/386737', '10.1093/oseo/instance.00012536', '10.1080/00138398.2017.1406735', '10.1093/acref/9780198708735.001.0001', '10.5040/9781472555427']",Uniwersytet Lodzki (University of Lodz)

Although a populist aspect is certainly present, reductio ad populismum neglects other interpretations of the current political polarization. The article contributes to the literature on the cultural aspects of illiberalism as it offers an innovative theoretical examination of illiberalism(s) in the region. It proposes the concept of neo-traditionalism as a more comprehensive lens of analysis of the anti-colonial narrative against the “foreign liberal West” to defend the “genuine traditional Europe.” Neo-traditionalism in Central-Eastern Europe captures two criticisms of progressive liberalism. First, it contrasts progressive modernizing values. Emancipation and fluid identities are counterbalanced by a discourse where traditions provide ontological security and culturally defined identities. Second, it denounces the foreign origin of progressivism. The liberal West is described as a colonial power aiming to destroy “our authentic way of life.” Thus, the populist dimension of illiberalism in Central-Eastern Europe could be better grasped if we applied the concept of neo-traditionalism. Not only are the elites isolated from the people. They are also deemed to impose a colonial project to replace and modernize true European values.","[('Francesco Melito', 'Jagiellonian University, Kraków, Poland')]","['10.1086/225264', '10.4135/9781446218693', '10.1080/23745118.2021.1956237', '10.1080/21599165.2020.1787161', '10.1080/01402381003654387', '10.1080/09692290.2018.1543718', '10.1093/oso/9780190877583.003.0005', '10.2307/2216048', '10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083', '10.1080/01402382.2019.1596696', '10.1080/13678860500100616', '10.1111/1467-9248.00165', '10.1177/0263276488005002014', '10.4135/9781446222195', '10.1080/17449855.2012.659033', '10.1177/0888325402239689', '10.2139/ssrn.2818659', '10.2307/1398681', '10.1086/696691', '10.4324/9780203895252', '10.1017/9781108576703', '10.1177/2336825X20954756', '10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x', '10.1080/13537113.2019.1602374', '10.1080/09651560701483329', '10.1057/9780230625303_3', '10.17645/pag.v5i4.1123', '10.1177/146349960334003', '10.1177/0002764218756924', '10.1017/CBO9780511816260.006', '10.1215/01903659-2409703', '10.1080/23745118.2022.2058756', '10.14202/vetworld.2020.11', '10.1080/09668136.2020.1784394', '10.1080/17405904.2019.1676808']",SAGE Publications

What many observers continue to overlook is that Burgess had been writing and speaking about these topics for close to a decade before the release of the film and its effects on popular culture. Using newly discovered archival and historical materials concerning his time in the United States, and being informed by Burgess’s entire canon, this essay details the untold story of Anthony Burgess’s long and particularly American association with and commentary on the topic of pornography as it related to contemporary cultural debates about obscenity, censorship, and literary and nonliterary intentions in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The findings of such research and analysis, it is argued, are crucial not only for understanding Burgess’s aesthetics and the evolution of discourse surrounding pornography in the second half of the twentieth century but also for better understanding and contextualizing American culture at the time.","[('CHRISTOPHER W.

This juxtaposition reveals a long history of dispossession and Black and Indigenous challenges to it, as well as a method for reading that history by attending to the poiesis of the archive, or the manner in which sources imaginatively remake what we know and how we act in ways that are not dependent upon the willful volition of individual actors.

The COVID-19 pandemic shines a spotlight on the vulnerabilities and gaps in global care networks. It creates a crisis of care on multiple levels—the immediate, the dispersed, and the systemic—and it is exceedingly difficult to keep them all in focus. Although Richard Powers’s Pulitzer Prize–winning novel, The Overstory (2018), is not about illness or pandemic, it can illuminate varied scales of care at the level of form, by moving from individual stories that are the typical subject of literary realism to a grand vision of the webbed planetary systems—the environment, the internet, the global economy—in which they are enmeshed. This essay argues that, read through the lens of pandemic, the overstory of Powers’s novel is the networks of interdependency that have put the world in grave danger and that gesture to an uncertain future.","[('Rachel Adams', '')]","['10.1525/9780520951853', '10.59962/9780774830119', '10.1525/9780520947801']",Duke University Press

French considers three groups of Americans—Shakers, Catholic priests and nuns, and followers of sexual reformer Sylvester Graham—whose sexual abstinence provoked almost as much social, moral, and political concern as the idea of sexual excess. Examining private diaries and letters, visual culture and material artifacts, and a range of published works, French reveals how people practicing sexual restraint became objects of fascination, ridicule, and even violence in nineteenth-century American culture.","[('Kara M.

Abolition has been the watchword under which initiatives proceed to eradicate the death penalty, human trafficking, nuclear weapons, the hegemony of Wall Street, prisons, police, the deportation of immigrants, and more. The essays in this forum examine nineteenth-century abolitionism’s complicated legacy through the prism of contemporary frameworks and agitations for justice and social transformation. The working papers reflect vital ongoing debates about abolition’s afterlives while meditating upon a series of pressing current concerns: migrant justice, the humanitarian rhetoric of some anti-racist initiatives, the activism of Erica Garner following the murder by police of her father, the racialization of madness and violence, the prison-abolition movement, and climate activism. By addressing the mobilization of rhetorics of slavery and abolition in our own vexed political moment, the contributors reveal that to think abolition now is necessarily to rethink abolition then.","[('Jeffrey Insko', ''), ('Michael Stancliff', ''), ('Jeannine Marie DeLombard', ''), ('Joy James', ''), ('Brigitte Fielder', ''), ('Jennifer C James', ''), ('Teresa A Goddu', '')]","['10.1215/9781478002581', '10.1353/tae.2020.0072', '10.9783/9780812296969', '10.1093/oso/9780198825647.001.0001', '10.22269/200616']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

I consider Marquis von Posa's function as a structural device outside the play's narrative present, as much as his role as a character within the narrative. I argue that Schiller's move from the domestic to the political does not constitute an abandonment of Diderot's theory, but rather its reformulation, with Posa as the new, shared situation against which other characters reveal their conditions. Giuseppe Verdi and the librettists Joseph Méry and Camille du Locle were required to mirror Schiller's change in narrative focus, but by adding their ‘Fontainebleau’ and ‘Auto‐da‐Fé’ scenes, they foreshadow, and thus prepare for, the change, thereby avoiding the need to rely on the morally ambiguous Posa. Diderot's theory is reflected in the opera through Verdi's adherence to nineteenth‐century voice‐character norms, coupled with the use of real‐world character parallels, allowing those on stage to represent an état dans la société. The importance of Schiller's extra‐temporal Posa is emphasised by Verdi's writing ‘old‐fashioned’ melodic material for him, but having it played on the newly developed and futuristic cornet à pistons, a recent innovation in nineteenth‐century brass instrument manufacture, with which, musically, Posa is closely associated.","[('Zak Eastop', 'University of Bristol')]",[],Wiley

The way in which people use language in communication, together with principles of human categorization, are the locus where language change and innovations are to be found. Interactional contexts in particular, seen as playing a crucial role in bringing about syntactic change (Traugott 2010b), have figured prominently in recent contributions on diachronic micro-changes, bringing to the fore the role played by dialogue as both the manifestation of the participants’ own voices and the realization of the constant negotiation that characterizes human communication. Against this background, this contribution focuses on a particular use of the Occitan post-verbal negatorpasin negative rhetorical questions, which was very productive in fifteenth-century collections of religious theatrical texts. It is claimed that these dialogic contexts allowed a polyphonic use ofpas, crucially restricted to this post-verbal negator, which is key to identifying the reasons behind the eventual establishment ofpasas the generalized sentential negator in the modern language.","[('Sandra Paoli', 'University of Oxford , Centre for Linguistics and Philology, Clarendon Institute , Walton Street , Oxford, , United Kingdom United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland')]","['10.1080/03740463.2006.10412201', '10.1016/j.amper.2018.11.001', '10.1075/tsl.11.03cha', '10.1075/tsl.45.24dah', '10.5334/gjgl.27', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199262601.003.0008', '10.1177/0260093513481149', '10.2307/417135', '10.1093/oso/9780199267040.001.0001', '10.1075/z.74', '10.1075/z.213', '10.14198/raei.1998.11.11', '10.1016/S0024-3841(01)00044-4', '10.1163/9789004253216_013', '10.1163/9789004253193_009', '10.1007/BF00632710', '10.1515/9783110936148', '10.1016/j.pragma.2017.01.011', '10.1007/BF00351935', '10.1075/hcp.4.09koc', '10.3765/salt.v25i0.3078', '10.1007/978-3-319-10106-4_18', '10.3917/ss.015.0115', '10.1515/9783110238617', '10.14220/9783737005609.105', '10.1515/9783111328959', '10.1080/03740463.2006.10412206', '10.1075/hcp.27', '10.1016/j.pragma.2017.10.006', '10.1017/S0959269500001745', '10.1075/pbns.16.12pri', '10.1353/lan.2015.0017', '10.3765/salt.v12i0.2874', '10.1023/B:LING.0000033850.15705.94', '10.1515/9783110872927', '10.1075/tsl.115.04sch', '10.1075/cilt.24.09clo', '10.1515/9783110220339.1.11', '10.1163/9789004274822_005', '10.1017/CBO9780511486500', '10.1515/9783110219302.73', '10.1016/j.lingua.2017.12.008', '10.1016/j.pragma.2008.08.012', '10.5565/rev/catjl.124', '10.1515/text.2003.011']",Walter de Gruyter GmbH

Scott Fitzgerald’s Tender Is the Night (1934) not simply as an episode but as the very backbone of the plot. Inserting Fitzgerald into an unexpected lineage that originates with James Weldon Johnson and moves to Ishmael Reed and Toni Morrison, it argues that Fitzgerald shares with these writers a complex fusion of racial disorder, musical contagion, and intergenerational rivalry. Like Johnson and Reed, Fitzgerald also uses the figure of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Topsy to announce the various permutations of race in the novel and to uncover the white characters’ fear of miscegenation and incest.

Attending to how the land has been shaped in partnership with Indigenous text making transforms American literary studies by demonstrating one way that Euro-American texts always were, are, and will be in relation to Native genres.","[('Caroline Wigginton', '')]","['10.5749/minnesota/9780816678181.001.0001', '10.2307/1834645', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199729722.001.0001', '10.5962/bhl.title.45369', '10.2307/2694059', '10.14321/j.ctv1595n77.19', '10.20507/AlterNative.2016.12.3.2', '10.18574/nyu/9781479872411.001.0001', '10.2307/j.ctt1d9nq9v', '10.1353/aiq.2008.0004', '10.1007/BF02443150', '10.1559/152304008783475661', '10.1179/1743277414Y.0000000078', '10.1215/9780822393832', '10.5749/minnesota/9780816690572.001.0001', '10.5149/9780807899472_round', '10.1080/13645145.2000.9634898', '10.2307/j.ctv7fmfq0', '10.9783/9780812205176']",Duke University Press

Compared to other surviving works by and on Shakespeare in Beckett’s possession, the Macbeth schoolboy copy shows an unusual abundance of reading traces and marginalia. However, passages that are not underlined or otherwise marked turn out to be equally important for an assessment of the play’s impact on Beckett’s writing, in addition to a grey zone of indeterminate or conceptual references that are harder to classify as allusions. This is especially the case when Beckett’s style becomes sparser, and he explores other dramatic genres such as radio or television alongside prose and theatre.

His method of measuring and combining temperature, humidity, altitude and magnetism in a geographical environment must be regarded as innovative, indeed, as the foundation of modern science. Although Humboldt lived in an analogue world and used the instruments of his time, his way of assembling information was not so different from what we are seeing in today's digitalised world. Information has no value unless it is shared. It does not say anything unless it is linked with other data. It cannot remain isolated but must be compared and interpreted. The generation of ʻBig Dataʼ was a pathway to Humboldt's concept of ʻKosmosʼ in much the same way as ʻBig Dataʼ today is the pathway to a virtual world. In this sense, Humboldt not only laid the foundation of modern science but anticipated the existence of a world where data and information are the source of everything when it comes to understanding the interconnectivity of the physical and the virtual world.","[('Daniel Grana‐Behrens', 'Department for the Anthropology of the Americas Universität Bonn / Frobenius‐Institut an der Goethe‐Universität Frankfurt am Main')]",[],Wiley
10.1093/melus/mlaa044,MELUS,0502 Foreign Language and Literature,"""What Race Problem?"": The Satirical Gaze of (White) History in The Underground Railroad",[],"Abstract This essay brings critical discourse on whiteness into conversation with African American satire to demonstrate how Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad (2016) engages in both traditional and postmodern forms of satire to trouble our assumptions about the function of historical fiction in a post-truth era. Whitehead satirizes various moments in American history to show how white power is maintained through a dialectic of fear. Whitehead's novel claims control over the white gaze by asserting a satirical black gaze, rendering established (white) history the subject of scrutiny. Through an engagement with W. E. B. Du Bois's “The Souls of White Folk” (1920) and bell hooks's “The Oppositional Gaze” (1992), I demonstrate how Whitehead utilizes satire to subvert this white gaze of history. When, in our contemporary post-truth moment, facts are ignored or repudiated—when reality looks disturbingly similar to “fake news”—and when the US president is a former reality television star with a nostalgic desire to “make America great again,” satire emerges as a way to throw the ridiculous into sharp, biting relief. The Underground Railroad exposes how an underlying (white) fear of black liberty and power contributes to the violence committed against black people throughout history, thereby demanding we take an oppositional look at American history in the ongoing project of emancipation.","[('Grace Heneks', 'Texas A&M University')]","['10.2307/3817047', '10.1215/00267929-2865057', '10.1111/jacc.12841', '10.18574/nyu/9781479829590.001.0001', '10.16995/olh.332', '10.1093/melus/mlz010', '10.1097/PHH.0b013e318252eea8', '10.1353/elh.2006.0020', '10.1353/cal.2017.0110', '10.4324/9780203499719']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

In Letters from the Earth (1962) and The Diaries of Adam and Eve (1997), Twain emphasizes the pure innocence of the supposed first man and woman and has Satan provide ironic commentary on God's paternal hypocrisy toward the “damned human race.” Through Huck, Adam, and Eve, Twain exhibits a parody of the exceptional nature of American innocence. By characterizing Satan as sympathetic, God as cruel and thoughtless, and humankind as the worst of the Creator's inventions, Twain draws attention to the distance between what is known to be human and what is thought to be just.","[('M.

Webb's The Garies and Their Friends",[],"AbstractThis article takes up the representation of voice in Frank J. Webb's 1857 novel The Garies and Their Friends to examine the relationship between Blackness, aurality, and text. Doing so requires an approach tuned to the novel's aural-linguistic dimensions that acknowledges that a character's speaking produces a diegetic sound and that the way characters interact with one another relies, in part, on how each perceives another's voice. It also means looking for how a text conveys a sense of sound both through techniques such as italics and capitalization and through instances of overt narration. Specifically, moments of mistaken identity pivot on the disruption of one character's accumulated presumptions concerning the sound of another character's voice and highlight how sound and listening reinforce processes of racialization, a dynamic Jennifer Lynn Stoever identifies through her work on the sonic color line. Instances of vocalization—moments when characters are depicted speaking and when the text itself performs vocality—defamiliarize social formations along the sonic color line long enough for the novel to scrutinize their underlying premises. Scenes in which characters' voices escape their assumed meaning trouble constructions of racial identity, particularly whiteness and its assumed control over speech. The Garies and Their Friends thus generates an alternative mode through which to critique the safeguarding of whiteness. Ultimately, the novel brings together overlapping meanings of voice, such as physiologically produced acoustic sounds and distinctive literary or authorial decisions, as a meditation on the interplay between voice and writing.","[('Diego Millan', 'Washington and Lee University')]","['10.1353/aq.2011.0042', '10.1215/9780822387558', '10.1215/00029831-2007-062', '10.1093/melus/mlx028', '10.1632/pmla.2011.126.1.55', '10.2307/1512286', '10.5040/9781501382895', '10.1057/9781137439598', '10.3138/cjh.2.2.29', '10.1093/alh/4.4.559', '10.2307/2714343', '10.9783/9780812206296.140', '10.5040/9781350387560', '10.1353/afa.2009.0041', '10.2307/j.ctt1bj4s55', '10.56021/9780801855979', '10.1215/9780822386933']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The play directly references Venice's long history with the plague as a way of indirectly referencing England's struggle with plague in and around the time of the play's production. Doing so enables the play to address from a safer distance uncomfortable realities about plague time in a way that benefits Ben Jonson's English audience. The play alludes to plague through its references to plague-time beliefs and practices such as omens, medicine, and quarantine, and associating several characters with carrion birds would have been an unmistakable reference to plague for Jonson's audience. The theme of reproduction anxiety that runs throughout the play is also a recognizable characteristic of plague literature. Volpone's association with disease, carrion birds, monstrous births, and other plague omens and signs allows the anxiety produced by these elements to be purged at the end of the play when Volpone is cast out.","[('Matthew Thiele', 'Glenville State College')]",['10.1017/S0040557400002052'],Edinburgh University Press

Attending to these differences provides insights into the impact of Poe's famous poem as both a literary work and a meditation on death, loss, and mourning. Also—in part because Poe paid attention to some of these poems as they came out, especially to ones published in 1845—looking at them sheds new light on biographical details, including Poe's contemporaneous reputation, willingness to consider alternative ideas, beliefs about racial bias, and engagement with the Boston literary establishment.","[('Paul Lewis', 'Boston College')]",[],The Pennsylvania State University Press

For the first time, a study of the background of this episode has been undertaken. In 1869–1878, Gradovsky was an ally of Dostoevsky, but in 1879 he already became his opponent. The main reason for this divergence is their different approaches to the problem of the relationship between the people and the intelligentsia, their role in the country’s history, in its present and future. Gradovsky’s position was reduced to the value of the intelligentsia as educators, with its progressive efforts being supported by the state, while the people were viewed as “passive material.” Dostoevsky, on the contrary, insisted on the active, effective nature of popular ideals, hence his call to hear and understand his people — the key goal set in the January 1881 “Diary of a Writer,” which became the last remark of the Russian thinker in this dispute.

Specifically, it offers a case study of Tourgée’s three Toinette novels (1874, 1879, 1881), all relatively neglected, to make the case for the importance of continuing to study nineteenth-century American literature at least in part in a national frame, but one that takes account of the complexities of temporality. One of the functions of American literary criticism at the present time should be the continued recuperation of lost or neglected voices like Tourgée’s.

Taking place primarily in 1954, the novel follows two seemingly disparate story lines, the first being that of Frank Money, a Black veteran of the Korean War, the second focusing on his younger sister Cee, who is subject to the eugenics project headed by her employer. As these storylines intersect, by virtue of these two characters being siblings, Morrison addresses the ties between military and reproductive violence and their ongoing legacies in the United States. I argue that military and reproductive violence are part and parcel of Frank and Cee’s possibilities of being hailed as Americans, to feel at “home.” Yet Frank’s interpellation is only possible when he participates in the murderous imperialism that drives US intervention in Asia, and Cee’s body is made fungible in the name of racist scientific “progress.” To be American is to buttress white supremacist ideologies around American empire and exceptionalism, and to be violent. Morrison demonstrates how exclusion from this narrative is fundamentally, necessarily, a Black feminist framework. I also address debt and indebtedness and how we imagine what is owed to whom. Finally, I draw on Christina Sharpe’s theorizing on “wake work” to demonstrate Morrison’s argument that spaces of home divorced from violence are only made possible through a Black feminist practice of care.","[('Yumi Pak', 'Occidental College , USA')]","['10.1086/494553', '10.1080/13557858.2020.1841120', '10.1093/melus/mlab035', '10.1353/mss.2016.0011', '10.1353/lit.2020.0033', '10.1215/9781478002253', '10.1086/495399']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The novelty of the study is in that Nero (the artist), a character who emerged from the writer’s knowledge and concept of Emperor Nero, for the first time becomes the subject of detailed analysis. Based on the evidence from the classical and early Christian writers, as well as on scientific and literary works written during Dostoevsky’s lifetime, the author makes an argument for Nero’s figure to be considered a junction of at least three elements. He is not merely Nero-the-artist, but also Nero-the-persecutor of Christians and Nero-the Antichrist.

Dostoevsky",[],"The article reconstructs the life path of Alexander Timofeevich Neofitov, the first legal representative of A. F. Kumanina. The recreation is based on the memorial, epistolary, biographic and historic resources introduced into scientific discourse. They include the testimonies from the unpublished memoirs of A. M. Dostoevsky, an unreleased letter by A. G. Dostoevskaya to N. N. Strakhov dated October 18, 1881, which characterizes the Kumanin case as “wretched and bewitched” (Russian State Archive of Literature and Arts. Fund 1159. List 6. File 6. Page 1), materials of the well-known Moscow trial of false-coiners, and other criminal cases (“The Jack of Hearts Club. Criminal trial.” 1877). It also comprises the details from the history of Moscow Academy of Commercial Studies, which Aleksei Alekseevich Kunanin had founded and where he served as a trustee. As a professor of World History at the Academy, A. T. Neofitov became one of the key members of the Jack of Hearts Club criminal network. His involvement in various illegal schemes with the Kumanin inheritance was described in Dostoevsky’s novels &lt;i&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Raw Youth&lt;/i&gt;. As a result of the inquiry, we can deduce that due to the fraud conducted by Neofitov, who was the ‘enfant terrible’ among the writer’s relatives, the Kumanin inheritance case turned out to be not only “wretched” and “bewitched,” but highly criminalized.","[('Valentina V.

His biographer Albert Bigelow Paine published a revised and expurgated version of “A Scrap of Curious History” in Harper's Monthly a few years after Clemens's death, but existing commentary on the sketch has been minimal and has relied on Paine's bowdlerized text, not on the surviving manuscript. Paine's changes—including his writing a conclusion to the piece—deviated from Mark Twain's intentions to write a dramatic sketch, ponderously open-ended and blunt, that examined the anxieties underlying radical politics and their relation to justice, terrorism, and social progress.","[('Christopher Ohge', 'Institute of English Studies, University of London')]","['10.1086/389184', '10.1093/oso/9780195132922.003.0005', '10.1017/S0361233300000594', '10.1215/9780822381624-003', '10.1525/9780520915282', '10.1093/jahist/96.4.979']",The Pennsylvania State University Press

After the father dies, a stranger miraculously appears to take the son away from the road to a family that meets every hallmark of the son's desire. The unsettling anachronism of this deus-ex-machina man is so discordant with the apparent nihilism of the rest of the book and McCarthy's previous works that it demands a careful reading to understand its meaning. Since McCarthy has never written a happy ending before, and has written vivid descriptions of dreams and laid hints throughout the book about their significance, it is at least possible that this happy ending is the boy's wishful dream.","[('Jacob M.

An Unusual Sample of Transitional Prose from the Island of Soqotra,[],"Soqotri is a Modern South Arabian language spoken by 100 000 inhabitants of the Island of Soqotra. The island is famous for its narrative art, first revealed to the Western world by the Austrian South Arabian Expedition around 1900. Until recently, Soqotri functioned as an unwritten language, and Soqotra’s traditional lore has mainly been transmitted orally. From 2014 on, an Arabic-based writing system for Soqotri has been implemented by a Russian-Yemeni research team. Originally intended as a means of preservation of the traditional oral lore, the writing system proves to be capable of meeting other intellectual demands – notably, to create original, non-traditional compositions. Apologetic and propagandistic works pertaining to the Muslim faith are among the first genres of the nascent Soqotri prose. The article analyzes one such composition in an attempt to trace the thorny path from orality to literacy on Soqotri soil: the adaptation of traditional narrative techniques; the difficult balance between purism and innovation; and interaction with Arabic. It shows that the concept of transitional text, mostly applied to poetry in modern literary research, can also be used about prose, including religiously motivated writing.","[('Leonid Kogan', '')]",[],Universidad de Navarra

This article focuses on the novels' depiction of the military service by soldiers of color, their transformation by those experiences, and how the protests and activism against the racism and discrimination experienced by soldiers of color contributed to the long civil rights movement. I argue that through the war experiences of the protagonists' older brothers in Tell Me How Long and Bless Me, Ultima, both narratives similarly present the contributions and experiences of soldiers of color during the war effort as they faced the dilemma of fighting a war for their country only to be denied full citizenship rights at home, which increased their social activism. Tell Me How Long describes the heroic service of an African American in battle in the Italian front that has a historical antecedent in the 92nd Infantry Division known as the Buffalo Soldiers, while Bless Me, Ultima focuses on the effects of the mobilization period in Mexican American communities in the Southwest and the war's psychological effects on returning soldiers.","[('Jose Fernandez', 'Western Illinois University')]","['10.2307/467197', '10.2307/1894253', '10.1515/9780691188102', '10.5040/9798216010159', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199384150.001.0001', '10.7560/717381-005', '10.2307/3660172', '10.5040/9798400677199', '10.9783/9780812209594', '10.1057/9780230601383_7', '10.1017/CBO9781139166782.004', '10.7560/756250', '10.7560/721159', '10.5040/9798400621956']",Oxford University Press (OUP)
