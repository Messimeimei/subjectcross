Over the past decade, an artistic movement has emerged that draws on machine learning as both inspiration and medium. In this book, transdisciplinary artist-researcher Sofian Audry examines artistic practices at the intersection of machine learning and new media art, providing conceptual tools and historical perspectives for new media artists, musicians, composers, writers, curators, and theorists. Audry looks at works from a broad range of practices, including new media installation, robotic art, visual art, electronic music and sound, and electronic literature, connecting machine learning art to such earlier artistic practices as cybernetics art, artificial life art, and evolutionary art. Machine learning underlies computational systems that are biologically inspired, statistically driven, agent-based networked entities that program themselves. Audry explains the fundamental design of machine learning algorithmic structures in terms accessible to the nonspecialist while framing these technologies within larger historical and conceptual spaces. Audry debunks myths about machine learning art, including the ideas that machine learning can create art without artists and that machine learning will soon bring about superhuman intelligence and creativity. Audry considers learning procedures, describing how artists hijack the training process by playing with evaluative functions; discusses trainable machines and models, explaining how different types of machine learning systems enable different kinds of artistic practices; and reviews the role of data in machine learning art, showing how artists use data as a raw material to steer learning systems and arguing that machine learning allows for novel forms of algorithmic remixes.","[{""name"": ""Sofian Audry"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

It demonstrates how distinguishing explicit and implicit diversity policy enables a better understanding of the policies, practices and strategic actions that impact workforce diversity outcomes. We provide an in-depth analysis of the different types of intervention that have been used to increase workforce diversity in the film and television industries in the UK since 2012. We then examine the arguments used to justify increased workforce diversity, focusing on the ‘business case for diversity’ and the logics which underpin it. Drawing on our own research as well as on industry reports and secondary literature, we examine the explicit and implicit workings of these policies and how they affect workforce diversity outcomes. We argue that the implicit/explicit dichotomy nuances and improves our understanding of the competing and contradictory forces that shape strategic courses of action regarding workforce diversity in the film and television industries, and provides a more nuanced conceptualisation of diversity policies and their outcomes.","[{""name"": ""Jack Newsinger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Doris Ruth Eikhof"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/10286630902746245"", ""10.1080/10286630902923323"", ""10.1177/1367549417733002"", ""10.1080/09548963.2011.589710"", ""10.1111/gwao.12199"", ""10.1108/17566261211234652"", ""10.1177/1350508416687768"", ""10.1108/ER-08-2012-0061"", ""10.1080/10286630500067606"", ""10.1177/0170840612453525"", ""10.1057/9781137426383"", ""10.1080/15405702.2013.810081"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2017.0386"", ""10.1080/10286632.2011.561334"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-71716-6_25"", ""10.1080/14682753.2015.1015802"", ""10.1177/0950017016643482"", ""10.1177/0950017014542498"", ""10.1177/0163443711436356"", ""10.1177/1360780417726732"", ""10.1111/1467-954X.12242""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Urban Studies', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

This article explores how mainstream print media covered the COVID-19 pandemic during this time of crisis. The news media play a key role in keeping the public informed during such health crises and potentially shape citizens’ perceptions of the pandemic. Drawing on a content analysis of 681 front-page news stories across eleven English-language publications, we found that nearly half of the stories used an alarmist narrative, more than half of the stories had a negative tone, and most publications reported in an episodic rather than thematic manner. Most of the stories focused on impacts of the pandemic and included high levels of sensationalism. In addition, despite the alarmist and negative nature of the reporting, most of the front-page reports did not provide information about ways to limit the spread of the virus or attempt to counter misinformation about the pandemic, raising key issues about the roles and responsibilities of the South African media during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that South African newspaper coverage of COVID-19 was largely negative, possibly to attract audience attention and increase market share, but that this alarmist coverage left little possibility for citizens’ individual agency and self-efficacy in navigating the pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Herman Wasserman"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419371151 University of Cape Town""]}, {""name"": ""Wallace Chuma"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419371151 University of Cape Town""]}, {""name"": ""Tanja Bosch"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419371151 University of Cape Town""]}, {""name"": ""Chikezie E.

Gender Inequality Data and the Rhetoric of Inclusion in the US and UK Film Industries,"This article argues that cis, hetero, abled, middle-class, white men – as a group and as an identity category – are the structuring absence of inequality discourse and, as a consequence, it is ‘diverse’ persons who bear both the burden of and any hope for changing the film industry. By ‘re-reading’ gender inequality data, diversity initiatives and inclusion rhetoric, this article shows the ways in which they elide men's domination of the film industry and perversely reinforce it as the norm. Articulating how data on gender representation behind the camera can both illuminate inequality and be used to obfuscate it, the article looks closely at selected reports in order to see what they do and do not tell us about gender inequality and the unequal presence of men in the industry. As the dominating demographic of the film-making workforce, the white middle-class male is also the structuring absence of the inclusion rhetoric which maintains the status quo of inequality in the film industry by interpellating ‘diverse’ persons as outsiders who must gain the attention of the white middle-class men who may or may not choose to include them.","[{""name"": ""Shelley Cobb"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/978-1-137-55495-6_12"", ""10.1111/1467-954X.12244"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748698233.001.0001"", ""10.1111/gwao.12318"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-48992-0"", ""10.1177/1350506817692387"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2017.0386"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2020.0506"", ""10.1525/fmh.2017.3.3.107""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Urban Studies', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

This also enables an exploration of how various diversity issues have been addressed within the specifically depoliticised language used to articulate such inequalities within the film sector and an examination of whether recent developments in the British film industry are a genuine challenge to the exclusion of ethnic minorities in British film. At a moment when the diversity agenda has re-emerged, this article offers a critical examination of the ways in which specific political moments have influenced the production and grammar of contemporary diversity policy. The article concludes by offering an analysis of current diversity strategies devised from the beginning of the British Film Institute's role as the lead body for British film production in 2011 to the present day and traces out the patterns of decontextualisation, naturalisation and acquiescence which characterise such strategies.","[{""name"": ""Clive James Nwonka"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1525/fmh.2017.3.3.107"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2014.0200"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748698233.001.0001"", ""10.1177/014920638801400206"", ""10.1525/9780520937871"", ""10.1215/9780822373650"", ""10.1080/15405702.2013.810068"", ""10.1057/9781137426383"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2012.0094"", ""10.1080/10286632.2015.1015532"", ""10.1080/15405702.2013.810081"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2017.0386"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2012.0065"", ""10.1080/14682753.2015.1015802"", ""10.1080/09548963.2016.1170943"", ""10.3998/mij.15031809.0003.101""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Urban Studies', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1525/FQ.2022.75.3.26,FILM QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,ON THE NECESSITY OF BAD TRANS OBJECTS,"Despite newly affirming images of transgender people proliferating across US visual media, there has been a concomitant rise in anti-transgender attitudes, transphobic legislation, and trans antagonistic violence. The assumption that more and better images of transgender people are key to achieving transgender equality strains under the weight of an emerging contradiction: “good” representation does not necessarily mean reduced social or political antagonism for transgender people. Rather, the emergence of “good” (i.e. marketable) trans media objects illustrates how the most politically challenging aspects of transgender identification are increasingly forced outside the horizon of representability. This essay turns away from “good” transgender representations and toward an archive of recently canceled “bad” transgender media objects, offering new assessments of their unexpected value. Claiming badness as a trans property that must be embraced to achieve sex and gender liberation, it defends bad trans objects as unrecognized sources of transformative potential.","[{""name"": ""Cáel M.

Fact-checking the 'disinfodemic' in Southern Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Based on virtual ethnography and online interviews, we provide new evidence of how fact-checking organizations based in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia responded to the influx of conspiracy theories, mis- and disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study seeks to answer the following questions: What kind of responses did ZimFact, Africa Check and Namibia Fact Check put in place to combat the spread of the ‘disinfodemic’ during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Southern Africa? To what extent were these interventions effective in terms of combating the viral spread of the ‘disinfodemic’ in the broader information ecosystem? It argues that through a combination of manual and technology-enabled verification processes, these organizations were partly able to debunk some of the harmful, conspiratorial and misleading claims related to the coronavirus. It demonstrates that fact-checking alone is not enough to stem the ‘disinfodemic’ unless it is complemented by an ecosystem that prioritizes access to information, media literacy initiatives, proactive takedown interventions by platform companies and increased public awareness on truthful and credible public health information. Furthermore, fact-checking organizations need to increase the speed at which they respond to the ‘disinfodemic’ if virality, which is the major driver of this ‘phenomenon’, is to be mitigated. We recommend that fact-checkers should implement efficient mechanisms of decentralizing their activities, amplify the sharing of verified information, forge collaborative initiatives with key actors and ramp up critical media literacy programmes.","[{""name"": ""Admire Mare"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000087529062 Namibia University of Science and Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Allen Munoriyarwa"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000010109131X University of Johannesburg""]}]","[""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1002/9781118841570.iejs0022"", ""10.1177/1329878X0310700106"", ""10.25200/BJR.v7n2.2011.355"", ""10.1080/21670811.2018.1493940"", ""10.3390/ijerph17072309"", ""10.1080/10584609.2019.1661888"", ""10.17645/mac.v6i4.1519"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30461-X"", ""10.1386/jams_00065_1""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Communication', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

As a philanthropic initiative organized through a network of international cities, 100RC demonstrates how the spread of resilience thinking has been facilitated by exploiting changes in the structures and processes of global governance afforded by neoliberal globalization. The analysis focuses on explicating100RC’s animating logic of governance, which is committed to the cultivation of network connectivity. Rather than directly fostering resilience, connectivity is established as a condition under which resilience solutions can be immanently surfaced from the interactions of a diverse selection of stakeholders brought together through these networks. The article situates this governmental logic within broader changes associated with neoliberal globalization, namely the emergence of multi-scalar governance networks, the rise of philanthrocapitalism and the inception of platform capitalism. The conclusion discusses the implications of this analysis for further study of the relation between connectivity, danger, knowledge and value contained within resilience discourses.","[{""name"": ""Chris Zebrowski"", ""affiliation"": [""Loughborough University, UK""]}]","[""10.1177/0002764214550299"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12079"", ""10.1068/d140133"", ""10.1177/1474474017726556"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-27295-2_12"", ""10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00310.x"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2005.07.002"", ""10.4324/9781315773810"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195328721.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10021-001-0101-5"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12010"", ""10.1177/0305829816638166"", ""10.2218/finsoc.v3i1.1936"", ""10.1111/1467-8330.00252"", ""10.1080/02723638.2018.1446870"", ""10.1080/03085140902786611"", ""10.1002/9780470400791"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2003.11.007"", ""10.1177/1534484305285335"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2012.02.006"", ""10.1080/01436597.2014.868989"", ""10.2307/591464"", ""10.4159/9780674369542"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511549472"", ""10.1080/0969229032000048853"", ""10.1080/0955757042000203632"", ""10.1080/09654310120079797"", ""10.1177/0002764215591187"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-94860-4"", ""10.1177/0967010611399616"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.07.011"", ""10.5751/ES-05100-180122"", ""10.1177/0149206307305562"", ""10.1080/21693293.2013.804672"", ""10.1080/21693293.2016.1228158""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Strategy and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Drawing on social identity theory and the scholarship on populist rhetoric and anti-LGBTQ politics, the article examines 46 interviews, press statements, public speeches, and op-eds by Orbán. Using critical discourse analysis (CDA) and Wodak’s discourse-historical approach, it shows how the prime minister frames LGBTQ communities as an out-group that poses a threat to Hungarian values and way of living. Similar to the issue of immigration and existing anti-LGBTQ frames in other countries, Orbán presents LGBTQ groups within his well-established anti-Western narrative. In addition, he connects LGBTQ communities to other out-groups that have been portrayed as a threat for a long time. The study sheds new light on the linguistic strategies of Orbán and shows how populist rhetoric and social categorization complement each other in a political campaign.","[{""name"": ""Marton Gera"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1080/10758216.2019.1643249"", ""10.1057/9780230592100"", ""10.1080/14754835.2014.919213"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316336045"", ""10.1080/13510347.2015.1076214"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16319-8"", ""10.1177/0038038518762081"", ""10.1080/13510347.2018.1485015"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12334"", ""10.1080/14754835.2014.919217"", ""10.1177/1369148117715646"", ""10.1086/702229"", ""10.1515/9789633861103-010"", ""10.1080/13510347.2018.1455664"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328522"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.1086/701832"", ""10.1080/13510347.2017.1328676"", ""10.1080/23745118.2020.1717064"", ""10.19195/1899-5101.11.2(21).5"", ""10.1177/13634607211008067"", ""10.1017/S1537592718002165"", ""10.1177/1742715018793741"", ""10.1093/ccc/tcz009"", ""10.1177/0093650216644026"", ""10.1177/0957926516687406"", ""10.1080/23745118.2019.1569338"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00230"", ""10.1177/1369148118775043"", ""10.4135/9781849208871"", ""10.1177/0888325418796929"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2018.07.005"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0043"", ""10.26529/cepsj.168"", ""10.1177/1750481320963273"", ""10.1017/S1755048321000134"", ""10.1080/08865655.2017.1402200"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2010.00476.x"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1017/gov.2012.11"", ""10.1080/14754835.2019.1647100"", ""10.1057/cep.2008.31"", ""10.1017/gov.2013.21"", ""10.1007/s12119-014-9254-1"", ""10.1080/13569775.2020.1781332"", ""10.21832/RUSSEL3453"", ""10.1111/bjso.12419"", ""10.1177/0268580920930591"", ""10.1177/0093650218794854"", ""10.1177/0267323116680132"", ""10.1080/15362426.2015.1010872"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8260.1979.tb00324.x"", ""10.4324/9780203505984-16"", ""10.1177/2336825X1802600110"", ""10.1080/14782804.2020.1757415"", ""10.19195/1899-5101.12.2(23).4"", ""10.1177/0957926593004002006"", ""10.1057/s41295-021-00256-3"", ""10.5406/illinois/9780252037726.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14754835.2014.919218"", ""10.1075/dd.4.2.04wod"", ""10.1002/9781118611463.wbielsi116"", ""10.4135/9781446270073"", ""10.1177/0957926519889109"", ""10.4000/mots.23007"", ""10.1177/0957926520977217"", ""10.5040/9781472544940""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1515/jcde-2021-0009,JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY DRAMA IN ENGLISH,1303 Drama Film and Television,Viral Theatre: Preliminary Thoughts on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Online Theatre,"Abstract Theatre has been associated with contagion and contagious emotions since Plato and Aristotle. In the twentieth century, Antonin Artaud proposed that theatre or performance should be like the plague that takes control of actors’ and spectators’ bodies and infects them with an affective energy. For these infections to happen, however, audiences and actors must be in the same room. In times of the corona pandemic, this spatial proximity has been substituted by theatre mostly performed and/or streamed online. This article offers some preliminary thoughts on this development: it considers what we descriptively call “viral theatre.” We argue that we currently witness a form of viral theatre that manifests itself through an interplay of three aspects: first, the fact that both performers and spectators are in a state of disruption, second, the willingness/expectations on the part of spectators to participate in the event, and, finally, the use of communication technologies such as Zoom. The framework of the pandemic, therefore, enhances and modifies what viral theatre can be and what kind of effect it can have, oscillating between more Platonic notions of dangerous contagion when plays force us to explore questions of complicity and the Aristotelian ideal of cathartic emotions when plays/performers reach out to us for moral support.","[{""name"": ""Heidi Liedke"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Koblenz-Landau Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Monika Pietrzak-Franger"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Vienna Austria""]}]","[""10.1057/978-1-137-48044-6"", ""10.1080/10714420490886952"", ""10.2307/j.ctv47w3vf"", ""10.1177/1461445605050364"", ""10.4324/9780203128176"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-46371-5"", ""10.1353/dtc.2015.0011"", ""10.1515/texmat-2017-0016"", ""10.1177/0163443717717633"", ""10.1353/tj.2014.0084""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

It then shows how these criticisms pertain to the recent application of mirror neuron research to account for some of our responses to movies, particularly our empathic response to film characters and our putative simulation of anthropomorphic camera movements. It focuses especially on the “egocentric” conception of the film viewer that mirror neuron research appears to license. In doing so, it develops a position called “serious pessimism” about the potential contribution of neuroscience to the study of film and art by building upon the “moderate pessimism” recently proposed by philosopher David Davies. It also offers some methodological recommendations for how film scholars should engage with the sciences.","[{""name"": ""Malcolm Turvey"", ""affiliation"": [""Dept. of History of Art and Architecture and Film and Media Studies Program, Tufts University, USA malcolm.turvey@tufts.edu""]}]","[""10.1515/9781400838080"", ""10.4324/9781315764887-9"", ""10.1126/science.1106138"", ""10.1159/000072786"", ""10.1126/science.1106138"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198790648.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198790648.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230"", ""10.1162/jocn_a_00602"", ""10.3167/proj.2018.120203"", ""10.1515/9781400838080"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0211026"", ""10.1111/jaac.12009"", ""10.1162/jocn_a_00602"", ""10.1038/nrn2805"", ""10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230"", ""10.3167/proj.2018.120203"", ""10.1038/nrn2805"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0211026"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2004.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.02.034"", ""10.1159/000072786"", ""10.1111/jaac.12009"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2004.07.002"", ""10.4324/9781315764887-9"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.02.034""]","['Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

The study surveys the digital resources utilized by both therapists and clients; how these resources are used; and how such use relates to drama therapeutic goals, values and techniques. Most notably, interviewees mentioned using Skype for therapy and/or supervision; the use of smartphones to cross the boundaries of the session (introduce or send out material); and the gaze of the camera as a fantasized audience. Interviewees commented on the therapeutic, dramatic, relational and ethical significance and impact of these practices, as well as on the ongoing digitization of society at large and its effects on their practice. The article further delineates the challenges evident in their experiences and proposes theoretical directions for further exploration.","[{""name"": ""Amir Atsmon"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012107842X Tel Hai Academic College, Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Susana Pendzik"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012107842X Tel Hai Academic College, Israel""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-01535-0_11"", ""10.1038/nature11421"", ""10.1037/13620-004"", ""10.1177/0165551512470051"", ""10.1093/jmt/41.4.282"", ""10.1080/15289168.2013.762836"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-53593-1_7"", ""10.3233/TAD-2006-18306"", ""10.1177/1943862111407512"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2012.03.010"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2006.03.001"", ""10.1108/10748120110424816"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01137.x"", ""10.1386/vcr.7.2.121_1"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-53593-1_6"", ""10.1080/15401383.2011.630308"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2008.09.002"", ""10.1177/0956797616645673"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2014.01.002"", ""10.1080/09515089.2011.556606"", ""10.1386/dtr_00013_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"
10.1093/adaptation/apz033,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Towards an Integrative Methodological Approach of Film Remake Studies,"AbstractThis article argues that, after decades of pointing towards the importance of including production and reception research into the study of film remakes, we should actually start addressing production and reception methodologies and investigate why this is necessary for the sustainability and future development of the field. I argue that a lot can be learned from the insights coming from the existing methodologies that are being used in, that is, format studies, (critical) media industry studies, (audiovisual) translation studies, and more recently the study of cultural transduction. The first section of the article mainly deals with the importance of investigating the different cultural mediators that take part in the production lifecycle of the film remake. It is contended that the analysis of film remakes should start examining the different individuals or institutions that mediate or intervene between the production of cultural artefacts and the generation of consumer preferences. The second part of the article points towards the importance of investigating the reception, experience, and interpretation of film remakes. It is shown that crucial questions like ‘(why) do audiences prefer the domestic remake over the foreign film?’, ‘how do audiences experience, interpret, and explain differences and similarities between source films and remakes?’, but also ‘how do audiences define and assess film remakes?’ remain yet to be asked. The article concludes that if the field of remake studies wishes to break out of its disciplinary boundaries, adopting a multi-methodological approach will help to further brush off its dusty character of textual analysis.","[{""name"": ""Eduard Cuelenaere"", ""affiliation"": [""Ghent University"", ""University of Antwerp""]}]","[""10.2307/1314830"", ""10.1075/btl.141.03bil"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-62806-6"", ""10.1515/commun-2019-2057"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2018.08.001"", ""10.1080/13556509.2014.967476"", ""10.2307/j.ctv36xw5nm.24"", ""10.1080/14781700.2013.877208"", ""10.1075/btl.141.04gam"", ""10.1007/s10824-006-9025-4"", ""10.14361/transcript.9783839428948"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474407236.003.0014"", ""10.1093/screen/30.4.36"", ""10.1080/01956051.2017.1319200"", ""10.2307/j.ctv36xw5nm.22"", ""10.1007/s10824-007-9059-2"", ""10.1177/016344388010004006"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.10424-6"", ""10.1177/1749602017729312"", ""10.1386/cjcs.7.1.37_1"", ""10.2307/j.ctv10crd8x.11"", ""10.1515/commun-2019-2058"", ""10.1057/9781137263353"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52854-0_11"", ""10.1515/9780748647040"", ""10.4324/9780203807125"", ""10.4135/9781849200400.n16"", ""10.7202/000736ar"", ""10.1515/9780748677474"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474407236.003.0001"", ""10.4135/9781452204147"", ""10.1515/commun-2019-2057"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apy020"", ""10.15847/obsOBS812014707"", ""10.1177/1527476404268922"", ""10.1386/jcc.1.1.27_7""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Law']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Departing from an understanding of speech as a semiotic mode in the oral-aural modality, the development of interpreting practices since the early twentieth century is reviewed with respect to the use of technology as a sign-conveying medium. Special emphasis is given to the introduction of “telephonic” interpreting and its implications for “visibility” in interpreter-mediated communication before the introduction of audiovisual transmission systems. Based on the examination of some existing models of multimodal language use, and further theoretical reflection, a conceptual framework is suggested to account more explicitly for different medium-based forms of interpreting and for the communicative dynamics shaped by the mediality of these practices. On this foundation, video is discussed as a technological medium supporting novel professional practices as well as research approaches.","[{""name"": ""Franz Pöchhacker"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Vienna""]}]","[""10.1075/btl.3.11and"", ""10.1075/btl.111"", ""10.4324/9781315835839"", ""10.1075/intp.00004.ber"", ""10.7202/002176ar"", ""10.3138/9781442695528"", ""10.1075/intp.15.2.02dav"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-9077-4"", ""10.7202/003278ar"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807572"", ""10.1515/9783110296099"", ""10.1075/intp.18.2.02kry"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-9077-4_21"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511620850.001"", ""10.7202/003741ar"", ""10.1515/mc-2012-0001"", ""10.1075/intp.18.2.06ozo"", ""10.1075/hts.1.med1"", ""10.4324/9781315678467"", ""10.1016/0271-5309(83)90010-1"", ""10.1075/cilt.92"", ""10.1075/btl.17.21poy"", ""10.1075/intp.12.2.05roz"", ""10.1515/9783110296099-015"", ""10.1075/intp.3.2.01ste"", ""10.1075/ddcs.6.03sto"", ""10.1075/btl.4"", ""10.1075/ddcs.6"", ""10.5040/9781501304712""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

Media reporting on intimate femicide clearly illustrates how the murder of women by their intimate partners, are framed as isolated incidents rather than a systemic problem situated within a social context of male dominance. It is therefore increasingly important to understand how the media portrays victimhood and violence. This article explores how the murder of women by their partners are rarely classified as femicide, and how the media’s portrayal of these murders fails to convey the systemic nature of violence against women that also entrenches racial and class-based oppression by seemingly valuing some lives more than others. The focus is on the power of the media to obscure the nature of intimate partner violence, which entrenches a notion of ideal victimhood. In conclusion, the South African government’s response to this form of violence is explored, and the need for responsible reporting is called for in reporting on cases of intimate femicide.","[{""name"": ""Amanda Spies"", ""affiliation"": [""University of South Africa""]}]","[""10.1177/089124301015002006"", ""10.1080/07491409.2007.10162504"", ""10.1177/0886260502017005001"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-08305-3_2"", ""10.1080/14680777.2010.514110"", ""10.1080/14616700500250438"", ""10.1080/15205436.2014.964871"", ""10.1093/bjc/44.2.256"", ""10.1177/1741659010363044"", ""10.1177/1088767908326679"", ""10.4135/9781446212202.n6"", ""10.1386/jams_00010_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Health', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1386/josc_00056_1,JOURNAL OF SCREENWRITING,1303 Drama Film and Television,The not so universal hero's journey,"Since the 1990s, Joseph Campbell’s research into mythology has become a cornerstone of the most influential and deeply entrenched model of screenwriting practised and taught internationally. Campbell’s finding that the quest myth, the hero’s journey, is ubiquitous around the globe, across human time, and therefore universal is constantly cited to prove the universality of what Robert McKee calls ‘classical design’; the story of a protagonist facing obstacles in pursuit of a goal. However, a close analysis of three of the myths and rituals, which Campbell cites to prove his theory, demonstrate he misinterpreted the meaning of the myths. Knowingly or not, he projected Anglo-Western storytelling and cultural values onto Indigenous mythic narratives, which in fact have very different storytelling norms and serve a very different purpose to the individualistic striving for self-fulfilment which he identified. Given this, it is time for practitioners and teachers to stop claiming that the hero’s journey and by default classical design are universal. Given the current struggle for inclusion of diverse, multi-cultural and marginalized voices into mainstream storytelling, this corrective is well overdue.","[{""name"": ""Glenda Hambly"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123420938 La Trobe University""]}]","[""10.2307/3822971"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1433.2012.01426.x"", ""10.2307/2678206"", ""10.1086/jar.30.1.3629918"", ""10.1016/S0048-721X(81)80057-7"", ""10.1386/josc_00056_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Speech and Hearing']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)]]"

The media paratexts of Crazy Rich Asians used race-consciousness as putative resistance, engendering “messianic visibility”—an over-investment in cinematic identification as possessing transformative, even curative, political and personal potential for liberal cisheteronormativity. Meanwhile, Searching's marketing as a film not about race was a significant talking point in the U.S. press. Its colormuteness functioned to normalize the entanglement of Asian diasporic elites in the ranks of Silicon Valley's digital empire. The films’ lack of friction in relation to surveillance capitalism and neoliberal empire ultimately highlights the contradictions of race and/as resistance in the present moment.","[{""name"": ""Melissa Phruksachart"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Cultural Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

The additional focus was on studying the differences in preschoolers’ screen times between TV and digital devices. In order to reach the research goal, we have conducted a study involving 1,029 mothers of 4.5–7.5-year-olds. We have used a questionnaire with the three blocks of questions: demographics (age of the mother, age and gender of the child); use of digital devices (screen time per week); family socio-economics (socio-economic background of the family, extra activities of the child, mother’s education). The study showed that that a higher level of socio-economic well-being of the family and the opportunity to provide children with additional activities are associated with shorter screen time. Moreover, parents’ role models, their attitude towards digital device use and their perception of screen time norms significantly influence the time their children spend with devices. Another result is that preschool children spend more time watching TV (13 hours per week) than using digital devices (7 hours per week), regardless of the day of the week; and screen time on weekends is higher than on weekdays for both watching TV and using gadgets. Screen time has also been shown to increase between 4.5 and 7.5 years old, with the increase being related to longer time spent with gadgets rather than watching TV.","[{""name"": ""Aleksandеr N.

10.1093/adaptation/apaa006,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Nostalgia and Retcons: The Many Returns, Homecomings, and Revisions of the Halloween Franchise (1978-2018)","AbstractIn recent decades, the steady remaking of individual films and rebooting of film franchises evince the cultural and commercial appeals of reimagining established titles. This article analyzes how the related practice of retroactive continuity (retcon) functions as a nostalgic intervention within a franchise’s broad mythology and ongoing narrative. Nostalgia is a longing to return to a desired space or time from which one is separated, and the retcon is an attempt to bind the past and present within a particular franchise’s story world. As such, retconning is an act of nostalgia in at least two ways. First, retconning may be used to nostalgically restore a franchise to a lost, idealized state. Second, a retcon may alter a franchise’s overarching narrative while still preserving selected story elements from earlier instalments; in this case, the retcon creates new audience understandings of the franchise and invites a nostalgic revisiting of previous films. To examine nostalgia and retcons, this article uses the first eleven films of the Halloween series (1978–2018) as a collective case study, as the franchise is distinguished by frequent retcons. Further, the original Halloween (1978) has evolved into a lost ‘home’ to which filmmakers and audiences alike nostalgically seek to return. Overall, this article exposes how nostalgia manifests on the levels of narrative, aesthetics, theme, and marketing across the Halloween series. While illuminating these dynamics within the Halloween franchise, the article argues that, in ways that are related to and discrete from remakes and reboots, the retcon is a nostalgic practice.","[{""name"": ""Adam Ochonicky"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, University of Wisconsin Oshkosh""]}]","[""10.1057/9781137375889_4"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511814297"", ""10.3200/JPFT.32.3.98-120"", ""10.5040/9781800850217"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52854-0_11"", ""10.14325/mississippi/9781604734539.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9781137375889_1"", ""10.5040/9781628928587"", ""10.2307/j.ctvx8b7n1"", ""10.5040/9798216001959"", ""10.14325/mississippi/9781617039621.001.0001"", ""10.3167/9781845455590"", ""10.1080/17400309.2014.945884""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

This article aims to analyse the representation of place and space in both Gomorrah and My Brilliant Friend. More specifically, it will analyse the stylistic and narrative strategies deployed by the series' producers to construct a tourist gaze over an urban space that plays a crucial role within the narrative economy of both shows. It will argue that Gomorrah and My Brilliant Friend articulate a consistent aesthetic treatment of Naples that in the two shows is simultaneously depicted as a site of poverty, violence and abuse and a potentially appealing and exotic urban destination.","[{""name"": ""Alfio Leotta"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122923111 Victoria University of Wellington""]}]","[""10.1386/jicms.5.3.321_1"", ""10.1353/wan.1997.0017"", ""10.1016/j.tourman.2012.02.008"", ""10.2307/464648"", ""10.1386/sac.3.3.229_1"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-0576-1.ch001"", ""10.1080/02614340.2016.1176705"", ""10.1080/02614340.2016.1176711"", ""10.1080/02614340.2016.1273649"", ""10.1002/jtr.2142"", ""10.1386/jicms_00017_1""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Social Psychology', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

Focusing on an aspect that has received little attention to date, viz. the interpreters’ and legal stakeholders’ perceptions of VRI as a novel configuration in the legal setting, we use the Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) as a theoretical framework to analyse a set of interviews that were conducted with interpreters and police officers after they had completed a simulated VRI session. As a first step, the participants were prompted to compare this simulated experience to their real-life experience to check the degree of reality of the simulated encounters. Next, they were asked to talk about attitudes towards VRI and to reflect on their experience with VRI during the simulation. Among the key outcomes of this investigation is that the two social groups – police officers and interpreters – have different views, but also that there is a considerable degree of variation among the interpreters, indicating a low degree of stabilisation of VRI as a concept and practice among the interpreters.","[{""name"": ""Sabine Braun"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Surrey""]}]","[""10.1258/1357633053688679"", ""10.1093/cje/bep068"", ""10.1075/intp.9.1.03bra"", ""10.1075/intp.15.2.03bra"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2016.09.011"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2rh2bs3.9"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511489839"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2rh2bs3.7"", ""10.1558/ijsll.v20i2.247"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2rh2bs3.14"", ""10.1007/s11606-009-1236-x"", ""10.1207/S15327051HCI1812_3"", ""10.7202/011014ar"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2464.003.0008"", ""10.1177/030631284014003004"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2011.08.006"", ""10.1075/intp.12.2.05roz""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

While Canada has prided itself on its multicultural heritage, the nation’s relationship with the First Peoples – First Nations, Inuit and Métis – has been immoral, genocidal and assimilationist. The 2015 publication of the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action details a way forward from the colonial patriarchy of the past. Education in general, and music education in particular are charged with finding ways to incorporate Indigenous knowledge, perspectives and history into the curriculum. After an introduction to the issues of the marginalization of Indigenous voices I discuss several arts-based curricular and extra-curricular initiatives that reframe intercultural music education. I propose that developing cultural humility in music teacher education will be a step forward in the decolonization of our teaching and learning spaces. This includes a move from generic cultural competencies toward an attitude of ‘Cultural Humility’. Cultural Humility is discussed as an attitude toward engagement with peoples of cultures other than one’s own. The stance is based on life-long, self-reflective inquiry, and seeks to disrupt the power imbalance that defines ‘othering’, seeking to establish partnerships and collaboration.","[{""name"": ""Lori-Anne Dolloff"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1321103X16667863"", ""10.1177/1028315306287002"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2015.03.002"", ""10.1080/10476210701687625"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-22153-3_9"", ""10.1177/10570837030130010105"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3180555a2d"", ""10.1080/10714413.2013.842866"", ""10.1080/10705422.2010.490161"", ""10.1353/hpu.2010.0233"", ""10.1097/00001888-200306000-00002""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/adaptation/apz019,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,The Snow Queer? Female Characterization in Walt Disney's Frozen,"AbstractHans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale ‘The Snow Queen’ (1845) and its film adaptations have been examined from multiple perspectives by previous scholarly criticism. Recently, Gender and Queer theories have placed particular emphasis on the presence of non-normative romantic relationships between characters, namely, attraction between a young boy and an older woman (Kay and the Snow Queen), homoeroticism (Gerda and the Robber Girl), and even incestuous desire (Kay and Gerda), among others. In this paper, we will concentrate on how the original fairy-tale female characters and their interrelationships have been reworked in Walt Disney’s Frozen (Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, 2013), and we will analyse how the film’s representations of love, desire, and femininity simultaneously resemble and differ from its literary source. Firstly, we will explore how Andersen’s alluringly dangerous Snow Queen has been turned into a sympathetic character, Queen Elsa. Secondly, we argue that Gerda and Kay’s friendship has been transformed into sisterly love between the two female protagonists in the film, Elsa and Anna, whereas romantic heterosexual love, on the other hand, seems to have been relegated to a secondary narrative arc or done away with altogether, as the absence of a romantic partner for Elsa shows. Interestingly, having a Disney queen whose quest does not involve finding a husband has led some Frozen fans to speculate that Elsa could be the first lesbian Disney princess. Thus, we will also analyse Elsa’s character in connection with the different definitions of ‘queerness’. In light of all this, we discuss that Frozen is an example of the recent Disney trend to redefine true love and prioritize female bonding and empowerment. However, if we compare it to its literary precedent, the Disney adaptation seems to be less daring when it comes to portraying non-normative manifestations of love and femininity than Andersen’s original.","[{""name"": ""Auba Llompart"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Translation, Interpreting and Applied Languages, Universitat de Vic – Universitat Central de Catalunya""]}, {""name"": ""Lydia Brugué"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Translation, Interpreting and Applied Languages, Universitat de Vic – Universitat Central de Catalunya""]}]","[""10.3390/socsci7060086"", ""10.13110/marvelstales.29.1.0110"", ""10.1353/mat.2008.a258005"", ""10.1353/mln.2008.0025""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

In doing so, teachers and students in higher education are challenged to question why and how students are socialized into particular music education systems, traditions, or perspectives and to consider alternatives. In this chapter, we explore such reflexive processes, employing a theoretical reading analysis through Bourdieu’s concepts of habitus, and doxa. The data consists of group reflections and interviews with student-teachers that the authors conducted as part of an intercultural arts education project between Finnish masters students and two Cambodian NGOs. Based on our analysis, we argue that stepping outside of one’s cultural, musical, and pedagogical comfort zone is a necessary component of constructing and (re)negotiating teacher visions in music teacher education. However, this renegotiation may be discomforting for student-teachers, unsettling deep-seated visions of what good music education is and ought to be – the taken-for-granted doxa of music teaching and learning. Therefore, for music-teacher education to become transformative and reflexive, there is a need for such educational experiences that engage with processes that are related to the art of living with difference.","[{""name"": ""Alexis A.

By conducting a thematic review of the current national curriculum and policy documents from both historical and contemporary perspectives, the interconnection between the role of art and moral cultivation in China is discussed. Through an analysis of the national curriculum, the article suggests that applying process drama in school education can contribute to learning in the curriculum areas of both aesthetic and moral education. However, the existing commingling of concepts and definitions influences the actual drama practices in China. Consequently, a discussion of terminology is brought in, as well as an argument for the need to include drama as a discrete subject in schools, in addition to its function as a method for educational purposes. A process drama sample from the author’s drama praxis is included. The overall aim of the article is to contribute to an extended understanding of educational drama and theatre in a Chinese context and to gain new insights into possibilities and challenges for the future implementation of drama in education in China.","[{""name"": ""Sisi Zheng"", ""affiliation"": [""Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Norway""]}]","[""10.1080/13569780802410681"", ""10.1386/atr.5.2.113_1"", ""10.1080/13569780902868770"", ""10.1080/13569783.2014.954814"", ""10.1080/1356978042000255067"", ""10.1080/0305724042000315581"", ""10.1080/13569783.2019.1643710"", ""10.1386/atr_00055_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

I identify two basic mythical perspectives that have been crucial for the Czechs since the 19th century: the ‘particularist’ and the ‘universalist’. The latter originally only existed as a complement of the former, and it was not until 1968 that it was clearly expressed on its own (in its pro-Western version) in opposition to the particularist myth, eventually becoming the dominant narrative of the 1990s with their ethos of returning to the West. Once the post-revolutionary enthusiasm evaporated, however, the subsequent disillusion again came to be expressed through the particularist myth. While at present the universalist myth might seem as superior to the particularist one, from the perspective of theories of nationalism, both have their bright and dark sides, and it is only due to their present-day opposition that the particularist myth has taken the illiberal turn.

By 2019, all three of those legs have been turned upside down. China and Russia, among others, offer new ordering projects, countries enjoy “exit options” in the form of alternative patronage, and illiberal activist networks are in the ascendant. A closer look at the “why” and “how” makes clear that illiberal forces have appropriated and repurposed the toolkit used to expand liberal order, which suggests an apparent paradox. While some forms of liberal order—primarily on the political side—are in retreat, other forms of liberal order—especially in terms of institutional and multilateral arrangements—are being reinforced. We are, therefore, looking not at the end of liberal order, but at a third great transformation in it.","[{""name"": ""Alexander Cooley"", ""affiliation"": [""Barnard College and Columbia University, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel H Nexon"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgetown University, USA""]}]","[""10.1017/S1537592709090033"", ""10.1080/09668130802292143"", ""10.1093/cjip/pop013"", ""10.1080/01436597.2018.1529539"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139087230"", ""10.3386/w23189"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw011"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000155"", ""10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.158"", ""10.1080/21599165.2018.1491401"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0049"", ""10.1080/09636412.2019.1604988"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190916473.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0260210519000019"", ""10.1057/s41311-018-0165-x"", ""10.1353/book.47469"", ""10.1017/S0020818304582073"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000066"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2006.00650.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000206"", ""10.1177/0047117819834625"", ""10.1515/9781400846283"", ""10.1177/0022002705281669"", ""10.1093/ia/iiy026"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000398"", ""10.1162/002081802760199890"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.03.035"", ""10.1017/S0260210504006254"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7rjt2"", ""10.1080/09636412.2019.1604981"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2007.00460.x"", ""10.7591/9781501700385"", ""10.1177/0022343399036001006"", ""10.1017/gov.2016.41"", ""10.1177/0305829810363509"", ""10.1177/1354066110380963"", ""10.1080/0163660X.2018.1445353"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316343890"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00342"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511676406"", ""10.1080/09512748.2016.1154678"", ""10.1162/002081897550456"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801450228.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ia/iix238"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2011.01022.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000489"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0041"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00765.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Previous studies have shown that teen series continue to perpetuate a stereotyped gender representation and usually reproduce a heteronormative relationship model based on the myth of romantic love following the storyline of ‘Beauty and the Beast’. The present study consists of a close reading of three popular current Netflix teen series: 13 Reasons Why (), Élite () and Sex Education (). The results show an inversion of the gender archetypes of Beauty and the Beast. The three female protagonists are ‘badasses with a good heart’, embodying the typical archetype of the ‘Beast’, while the three male protagonists are patient, caring, innocent and even virginal, embodying the archetype of the ‘Beauty’. However, unlike in the classic model, the boys fail in their attempts to save their beloved from themselves, and the girls end up suffering irreparable consequences. The tragic end of the female characters condemns them to the impossibility of a redemption that has traditionally been granted to males.","[{""name"": ""Maddalena Fedele"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419370247 Universitat de Barcelona""]}, {""name"": ""Maria-Jose Masanet"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419370247 Universitat de Barcelona""]}]","[""10.17583/mcs.2018.2749"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.04.007"", ""10.1080/17400309.2013.809565"", ""10.1016/j.jaac.2019.04.020"", ""10.1177/0891243205278639"", ""10.1080/13676261.2012.718435"", ""10.33732/ixc/11/01Lasegu"", ""10.1080/15295036.2019.1704038"", ""10.1386/jptv.7.1.39_1"", ""10.1080/08838150801991971"", ""10.3167/ghs.2019.120203"", ""10.1080/13676261.2019.1570096"", ""10.5294/pacla.2019.22.2.5"", ""10.1080/08838150701820916"", ""10.1093/screen/16.3.6"", ""10.1080/17482798.2019.1612763"", ""10.1080/01956051.2015.1043232"", ""10.1386/cjcs.2.1.77_1"", ""10.1080/17482798.2012.673499"", ""10.1386/jptv_00061_1""]",['Social Sciences'],['Gender Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

Throughout American history, essentializing logics of value have connected metal, money, and racial difference. Critiquing these essentialisms, Wars dramatizes how imagining alternative futures motivates communities to operationalize logics of value that resist racist strictures in the present. A brief coda summarizes how the concluding gesture of this play set in the Civil War period looks to a time where speculative finance’s racialization of homeownership prompts reconsideration of (neo-)liberal multiculturalism’s principles.","[{""name"": ""Sasha-Mae Eccleston"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/01636545-2349071"", ""10.1080/14788810903515592"", ""10.1163/156920609X436162"", ""10.1353/gpq.2019.0018"", ""10.7312/garr18390"", ""10.1057/9781137355973"", ""10.1353/afa.2012.0016"", ""10.2979/meridians.11.2.212"", ""10.14321/crnewcentrevi.19.1.0037"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226629391.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2167278"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469648361.001.0001"", ""10.1002/j.1538-165X.2012.tb00718.x"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469653662.001.0001"", ""10.3138/md.50.1.77"", ""10.14321/crnewcentrevi.19.1.0011"", ""10.1002/9781444317978.ch17"", ""10.1353/aq.2012.0036""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

FQ columnist Caetlin Benson-Allott suggests that this may change in the wake of Michaela Coel’s incendiary series I May Destroy You (BBC One and HBO, 2020), which has answered a need for more artistically ambitious television about black life and for feminist-of-color critiques of rape culture on television. Hailing the series for its formal innovations as well as its generic and political interventions, Benson-Allott argues that I May Destroy You elevates its genre, and television more broadly, by contesting their prior shortcomings.","[{""name"": ""Caetlin Benson-Allott"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Within the cohort’s reflections, specific themes related to technology, cohort experience, course instruction and work–life balance are examined as well as drama therapy–specific aspects of their experience.

In this conceptual article we suggest five qualities of dramatic reality by which this integration can promote psychological development in old age: its ability (1) to evoke a story, (2) to bring together the personal and the collective, (3) to help in processing unfinished business, (4) to create an integrative view of the self and (5) to open the way to imagining the future. We illustrate each of the five qualities using vignettes from our previous research in the field and show how exploring the life stories of older adults through dramatic reality provides opportunities for active self-exploration in the ‘here and now’ of the group process in a way that goes beyond verbal life-story work.","[{""name"": ""Dovrat Harel"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000406315599 Ono Academic College andISNI: 000000012107842X Tel-Hai Academic College""]}, {""name"": ""Shoshi Keisari"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419370562 University of Haifa andISNI: 0000000417573470 University of Padua""]}]","[""10.1007/s10433-016-0409-9"", ""10.1177/1471301211421090"", ""10.1080/00332747.1963.11023339"", ""10.1017/S1041610215001532"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-53593-1_15"", ""10.1017/S1041610219000218"", ""10.1177/1471301213476290"", ""10.1024/1662-9647/a000235"", ""10.1080/13607863.2016.1199012"", ""10.1080/02630672.2001.9689578"", ""10.1177/1471301205058311"", ""10.1177/1471301213479787"", ""10.1080/13607863.2013.837140"", ""10.1080/13607863.2019.1594159"", ""10.1016/0197-4556(83)90006-0"", ""10.1016/S0197-4556(96)00052-4"", ""10.1037/0882-7974.17.1.125"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.5.2.100"", ""10.1037/a0033834"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2006.03.001"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.5.2.123"", ""10.1207/S15327957PSPR0401_4"", ""10.1386/dtr_00059_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

This article argues that the state-controlled newspaper, The Herald, in Zimbabwe deployed constructive journalism as an approach to report COVID-19. Constructive journalism is about injecting positive angles into news reports while abiding by the core news values of accuracy, impartiality and balance. The findings reveal that constructive journalism elements of solutions orientation, future orientation, and explanation and contextualization were frequently deployed by The Herald to advance a safe nation narrative whose objective was to prevent public hysteria in the face of a deadly COVID-19 outbreak in the country. The paper concludes that the deployment of constructive journalism in less developed countries like Zimbabwe to inspire hope through positive psychology in the face of global crises does not always yield the intended outcomes.","[{""name"": ""Thulani Tshabangu"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000097692525 North-West University""]}, {""name"": ""Abiodun Salawu"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000097692525 North-West University""]}]","[""10.1177/1464884918770523"", ""10.1080/17512786.2018.1470475"", ""10.1177/1464884918770537"", ""10.1080/17512786.2018.1472528"", ""10.1177/1464884918770885"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2017.1326834"", ""10.1080/17512786.2018.1470472"", ""10.1177/1464884918770555"", ""10.1177/1464884918770556"", ""10.1080/23743670.2016.1209224"", ""10.1386/jams_00060_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Audience attitudes to professional norms on local and English language radio news programmes in Ghana,"AbstractThe proliferation of radio stations across Africa has engendered an increase in local language radio stations and fuelled culturally-rooted practices of news delivery considered by many media professionals as sub-standard. This article explores the reception practices of multi-lingual audiences in Ghana, focusing on their views on the different norms and approaches of local language and English language radio newscasts. Using data from a convenience sample of 1000 radio listeners in five Ghanaian cosmopolitan cities the study finds that audiences prefer more performative modes of news delivery on their local language stations. It was also evident that radio audiences are discerning and make distinctions between what is acceptable on local language versus English language radio. These results call for a reconsideration of western-influenced standards of news delivery and the development of professional standards more accommodating of the inflections of culture.","[{""name"": ""Audrey Gadzekpo"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Ghana""]}, {""name"": ""Abena Animwaa Yeboah-Banin"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Ghana""]}, {""name"": ""Sarah Akrofi-Quarcoo"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Ghana""]}]","[""10.1177/001654927902500101"", ""10.1177/107769908706400401"", ""10.1080/10447318.2018.1497115"", ""10.1080/00913367.2005.10639191"", ""10.1177/1329878X1314900110"", ""10.2979/RAL.2007.38.3.136"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2015.06.009"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3250840"", ""10.1080/17464099.1987.12290170"", ""10.1556/084.2018.19.2.7"", ""10.1111/comt.12043"", ""10.1177/0196859917737292"", ""10.1386/jams_00008_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.3366/film.2020.0126,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,"A Cinema of Boredom: Heidegger, Cinematic Time and Spectatorship","Boredom, in cinema as well as in our everyday experience, is usually associated with a generalised loss of meaning or interest. Accordingly, boredom is often perceived as that which ought to be avoided. In Martin Heidegger's philosophical inquiry, however, boredom is posited as one of the fundamental existential dispositions that provide access to the possibility of philosophising. My contention is that boredom can be a tool for understanding spectatorship in cinema and, in contrast to the ordinary perception of boredom as something to escape, it can be a stimulus for reflecting on the images before us. To this end, I focus on Heidegger's tripartition of boredom – “becoming bored by something,” “being bored with something,” and “profound boredom” – and the ways in which these forms can be significant to cinema. I then consider boredom's potential for film spectatorship, differentiating between mainstream entertainment cinema as a means to evading boredom and less immersive forms of cinema which allow for boredom to remain present. On the one hand, “profound boredom” disrupts the potentially alienated relationship between spectators and spectacle-images by opening up a time which becomes long – something which Isidore Isou's On Venom and Eternity (Traité de Bave et d'Éternité, 1951) and, less manifestly, Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Eclisse (1962) and Ingmar Bergman's Cries and Whispers (Viskningar och rop, 1972) deliberately arouse. Thus, profound boredom can be a tool to criticise the spectacularised image in the cinema, promoting a pensive spectatorship. On the other hand, the escapism endorsed by mainstream narrative cinema can dialectically reveal the contemporary anxiety of horror vacui, therefore turning boredom into a means for investigating our relationship with time and the image. This article ultimately argues that boredom – that from which we daily try to shy away – has the potential to un-conceal the ways we understand and interact with moving images in the world we currently inhabit.","[{""name"": ""Chiara Quaranta"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Edinburgh""]}]","[""10.2307/1211632"", ""10.1163/9789042032125_005"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96872-8"", ""10.1163/9789042032125"", ""10.1086/448763"", ""10.1215/9780822395959-004"", ""10.1515/9781503624658"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-71803-3_6"", ""10.1525/9780520915381"", ""10.22230/cjc.2002v27n1a1280"", ""10.1080/10304312.2010.505331"", ""10.1093/screen/16.3.6"", ""10.1093/analys/anu041"", ""10.1353/nlh.2012.0027"", ""10.1093/screen/hjs007"", ""10.1163/9789042032125_008"", ""10.1162/OCTO_a_00019""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

This complexity spans a wide range of diversity dynamics related to various traditions of knowledge formation, multiple forms of cultural and artistic participation, feelings of national and ethnic belonging, and political instabilities which render possible shifting conditions for experiencing trust/distrust and societal unity/polarization. We argue that in music teacher education it is necessary to reflect on these intimate connections between music, education, and society and make our field an arena for dealing with substantial social change. In educating future music teachers to become change agents who can, if needed, challenge music education traditions, hierarchies, practices and structures, the professional ethos and standards need to be transformed so as to make teachers better equipped to handle the changing conditions created by new and emerging forms of diversity.Visions for Intercultural Music Teacher Educationpresents contributions that deal with these challenges in a variety of ways, through the perspectives of music teacher educators located around the world.","[{""name"": ""Heidi Westerlund"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sidsel Karlsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Heidi Partti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/14675980601065764"", ""10.1007/978-94-6091-503-1"", ""10.4324/9780203072103"", ""10.1057/9781137027474"", ""10.1080/14675980600840274"", ""10.1177/003172170508700318"", ""10.4324/9780203817551"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8601.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0255761415584300"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46328-5_2"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190246143.003.0013"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199384747.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0255761417703782"", ""10.4324/9781315747279"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46328-5_11"", ""10.1177/1321103X18757713"", ""10.1007/1-4020-4773-8_1"", ""10.1080/01419870701599465"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803932"", ""10.22176/act16.3.78"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199679485.003.0027"", ""10.4337/9781784715328""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Linguistics and Language', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

This work integrates the main results of several researches carried out by the author in different countries, whose main conclusions show that podcasting has acquired a transmedia narrative texture that goes beyond the monomedia model from its beginnings, giving way to a new medium, transpodcast, which presents complex structural systems characterized by a specific multiplatform grammar and a high diversity of contents. Transpodcast is supported by the development of robust affinity communities, users and fans. These communities are built as peer-to-peer communication spaces and algorithmic environments where an evident automation of the fandom takes place.","[{""name"": ""David García-Marín"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Computer Networks and Communications', 'History', 'Communication']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1515/jcde-2020-0003,JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY DRAMA IN ENGLISH,1303 Drama Film and Television,Tragedies of the Capitalocene,"AbstractThe idea of the “Anthropocene” is rapidly gaining currency as an ecocritical lens through which to view theater and performance. But as a lens for critical analysis, the concept of the “Anthropocene” is problematic, primarily because it fails to differentiate among humans, many of whom are in conflict precisely because the benefits and costs of the “Age of Man” have been distributed unevenly. Neo-Marxist critics take such conflicts into fuller account in their argument that a better nomenclature and concept for our epoch is the “Capitalocene,” a term that captures the fact that our ecological crises have been precipitated not by humans in some undifferentiated and generalized way, but more specifically by the global spread of capitalism and its socio-economic-ecological injustices. These are also conflicts at the heart of many plays, both historical and recent. This essay offers an overview of a number of works that might productively be categorized as “Tragedies of the Capitalocene,” insofar as they dramatize stories that trace the dynamics of “Capitalocene” exploitation of both human and nonhuman resources. Plays considered include Cherríe Moraga’s Heroes and Saints (1992), Rahul Varma’s Bhopal (2001), Kia Corthron’s A Cool Dip in the Barren Saharan Crick (2010), Annabel Soutar’s Seeds (2012), Robert Schenkkan’s The Kentucky Cycle (1991), and Colleen Murphy’s The Breathing Hole (2017).","[{""name"": ""Wendy Arons"", ""affiliation"": [""Carnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburghUnited States of America""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Many disciplines are now being intentional about asking critical and ethical questions around race, identity, social justice representation, and systemic change. The same is true for theatre and performance. While events in 2020 stretched and burdened racialized bodies, they also provided opportunities for many racialized bodies to be recognized perhaps because of their knowledge, experiences, identities, and the power and privileges they hold or do not hold. As an African in the Canadian theatre sector and scholarship, I acted in different capacities to address systemic injustice in Canada’s theatre scene during the pandemic. For instance, I co-facilitated some sessions with colleagues from Indigenous, Black, and People of Colour (IBPoC) community for the purpose of creating space for dialogue on issues of concern to this community. In this article, I reflect on how the pandemic produced an initiative that has the potential to address leadership challenges within the performing arts sector.","[{""name"": ""Taiwo Afolabi"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Using data from an online survey (N=254), this study reveals that social media was overwhelmingly the most used type of media for news consumption generally, and the most important source of news about the pandemic. Data further reveal that the impact of extensive exposure to fake news headlines about the pandemic was dangerous and could have a deleterious impact. Crucially, this study finds that recalling and believing fake news headlines and using social media as the main source of news, significantly decreases the likelihood of believing credible and real news stories. Finally, this study offers theoretical and empirical background to frame the debate about factors that influence the believability of fake news headlines by contributing and extending the theorization of the amplification hypothesis.","[{""name"": ""Temple Uwalaka"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000403857472 University of Canberra""]}, {""name"": ""Bigman Nwala"", ""affiliation"": [""Ignatius Ajuru University of Education""]}, {""name"": ""Amadi Confidence Chinedu"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000094087151 Rivers State University""]}]","[""10.1111/bjso.12233"", ""10.1257/jep.31.2.211"", ""10.18510/hssr.2020.8236"", ""10.1177/0267323118760317"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2018.1505934"", ""10.1037/a0013192"", ""10.1126/science.aao2998"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2011.10.002"", ""10.1177/0924051917738685"", ""10.1177/1077695819833552"", ""10.1101/2020.04.11.20061408"", ""10.1177/0956797620939054"", ""10.1177/1464884919868325"", ""10.1080/21670811.2017.1360143"", ""10.1080/22041451.2020.1804310"", ""10.1386/jams.10.1.3_1"", ""10.1080/23743670.2018.1473274"", ""10.1177/1464884917746861"", ""10.1080/23743670.2019.1627230"", ""10.1016/j.hlpt.2018.03.002"", ""10.3934/mbe.2020147"", ""10.1386/jams_00058_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Recent research on digital parental mediation highlights the various characteristics that define parental support and control over a child’s digital activity. This study is aimed at determining the relationship between digital parental mediation (parental control and parental support) and the psychological well-being (self-satisfaction and subjective happiness) of adolescents. The characteristics of digital mediation (control and support) are assumed to have opposing effects on the psychological well-being of schoolchildren. The study sample consisted of 4,011 teenagers aged 13 to 15 (M = 14.07, SD = 0.76), 42% of whom were male. In the course of the study, the Digital Parental Mediation Questionnaire, the I myself scale from the questionnaire, the Multidimensional Scale of Student Life Satisfaction, and the Scale of Subjective Happiness were utilized. Statistical processing involved exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, correlation and regression analyses. As a result, it was confirmed that parental control and support of a child’s digital activity are related, but their effects on psychological well-being vary. Thus, parental support increases a teenager’s satisfaction and happiness, whereas parental control decreases them. This effect is more pronounced in younger adolescents.","[{""name"": ""NATALIA A.

To seek recognition in the public sphere is an especially treacherous endeavor under these conditions. Faced with a range of imposed identities–including the refugee label itself–the quest for “more visibility” through documentary images is fraught with contradictions for the displaced. This article considers the ways in which filmmakers and artists with experience of displacement work with documentary methods and forms in the face of these extreme difficulties. As they challenge and seek alternatives to conventional forms of documentary, a range of new expressions and tendencies can be discerned in the wake of “The European Refugee Crisis,” from so-called participatory documentary to essayistic and more experimental approaches.

El objetivo del estudio fue reconocer la vivencia de las docentes acerca del uso de las redes de comunicación social para fines educativos, con sus estudiantes en condición de discapacidad intelectual. Para ello se realizaron entrevistas a profundidad que indagaron acerca de la organización de los servicios, las barreras que enfrentaron las personas con discapacidad para comunicarse por medio de las redes sociales para la educación virtual, las estrategias de mediación exitosas que desarrollaron para solventar estas barreras y las plataformas más provechosas para el estudiantado. Como resultado de la investigación se las docentes participantes describen su vivencia en el uso de las redes de comunicación social para fines educativos en tiempos de pandemia, con sus estudiantes en condición de discapacidad, como una experiencia compleja y en constante cambio, que se sujetó a una serie de circunstancias como el dominio de las personas con discapacidad en el uso de lsa redes, el apoyo que recibieron de sus familias; quienes a su vez contaron con distintos niveles de conocimiento acerca de las plataformas, las condiciones de confinamiento y pobreza, el recargo de funciones de las mujeres madres y cuidadoras para poder atender la educación virtual en casa y ofrecer el acceso a las redes de comunicación social a sus hijos e hijas, entre otras. Por otra parte se encuentra que algunas condiciones que viven las participantes, pueden amenazar con un aumento en la brecha de desigualdad, entre estas, se encuentra que el tiempo que pueden dedicar a la atención sincrónica y a la comunicación con redes para la educación de las personas con discapacidad es significativamente menor que el que dedican otros grupos estudiantiles sin discapacidad y con menos índices de vulnerabilidad. Pese a todo ello, se concluye que la coyuntura mundial frente a la pandemia fomenta la innovación y creatividad docente lo que hace que el estudiantado, aun en pocas proporciones; logre familiarizarse y habituarse al uso de redes de comunicación social, lo que facilita tanto su aprendizaje como sus oportunidades de inclusión social.","[{""name"": ""María del Rocío Deliyore Vega"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.15517/aie.v18i2.33066"", ""10.9757/Rhela.19.06""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Yet, three decades on, Ukraine’s democracy remains ineffective and superficial. It is thus productive—and apposite—to seek an alternative method for studying such a complicated and multidimensional problem. This article employs “causal layered analysis” (CLA), developed in Futures Studies to gain additional insight into the reasons for Ukraine’s incomplete and halting democratization. CLA aims to get to the underlying causes of problems and involves analysis at four “layers”: litany, system, worldview, and myth/metaphor. As we demonstrate here, this method can be fruitfully applied to better understand Ukraine’s democratization—or, rather, its lack of it. At the layer of litany, the main facts and data concerning democracy in Ukraine are summarized. The second—systemic layer—is related to the study of democratic transition based on the approaches of various academic disciplines and theories.

Almost immediately after this became public Disney faced such strong criticism and backlash they withdrew their petition. By October of 2017 Disney/Pixar released the animated film Coco. Audiences in Mexico and the U.S. praised it's accurate and authentic representation of the celebration of Day of the Dead. In this essay, I argue that despite its generic framing, Coco mobilizes many elements of horror in its account of Miguel's trespassing into the forbidden space of the dead and his transformation into a liminal figure, both dead and alive. Specifically, with its horror so deftly deployed through tropes and images of borders, whether between life and death or the United States and Mexico, Coco falls within a new genre, the border horror film.","[{""name"": ""Orquidea Morales"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

One of the consequences has also been the emergence of a new interdiscipline – Gesture Studies – entirely devoted to the investigation of the gestural modality in human interaction. However, while gesture and its relation to speech have been examined in face-to-face conversations, oral narratives, public speaking, task-based discourse, as well as other types of communicative situations, only a handful of studies to date have documented, analysed and described the range and functions of the gestures produced by conference interpreters in the booth. One of the possible reasons for this lack of attention to the body in interpreting has to do with the emphasis on decontextualised cognitive processes in the simultaneous interpreting (SI) mode, which dominated the academic field of conference interpreting research since its beginning in the 1950s until the mid-1990s (Diriker 2004: 7; Gile 1998: 70; Pöchhacker 1995: 33). In addition, the historical shift from consecutive to simultaneous interpreting in conference settings and the now more generalised use of remote interpreting resulted in a removal of the interpreter’s body from the public eye. All this, coupled with the still prevalent notion that simultaneous interpreting (SI) is an essentially verbal and monologic endeavour, as well as the difficulty in finding interpreters willing to be filmed and/or securing permission for filming, led to a dearth of multimodal data in Conference Interpreting Research. The present volume constitutes a first clear attempt at redressing this imbalance by ‘linking up with video’, while this specific chapter hopes to start filling this gap by contributing to a better understanding of the role played by gesture in SI discourse and by introducing the reader to a qualitative microanalytical approach to gestural behaviour that may be applied to the study of other modes of interpreting. After defining gesture and its structural properties within the framework of an integrated multimodal view of language and communication and introducing some working concepts from the field of Gesture Studies, the chapter presents a video-based quasi-experimental study with four professional conference interpreters working simultaneously from English into European Portuguese (henceforth ‘Portuguese’). The study constitutes the first part of a larger research project which explores gesture production in SI by triangulating the data, methods and results from the open quasi-experiment described here, an observational field study with the same subjects, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with a larger number of interpreters. Due to space limitations, however, this chapter will only cover the first investigation. The findings offer an insight into the rich range of gestures deployed in the booth and shed some light on the multimodal nature of meaning-making in simultaneous interpreting.","[{""name"": ""Elena Zagar Galvão"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Porto""]}]","[""10.1515/les-2013-0004"", ""10.1177/0146167295214010"", ""10.1075/gs.1.15bav"", ""10.1016/j.jml.2007.02.004"", ""10.1515/semi.1999.123.1-2.1"", ""10.1075/gs.5"", ""10.1075/btl.53"", ""10.1075/target.10.1.04gil"", ""10.1515/9783110813098.207"", ""10.1207/s15327973rlsi2703_2"", ""10.1016/0378-2166(94)00037-F"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807572"", ""10.1075/gest.6.1.03kim"", ""10.1007/BFb0052986"", ""10.1016/S0378-2166(99)00079-X"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511620850"", ""10.1080/14797585.2014.920184"", ""10.1075/btl.17.21poy"", ""10.7202/017983ar"", ""10.1353/lan.1977.0041"", ""10.1075/btl.43.05set"", ""10.1075/btl.28"", ""10.1080/13556509.2008.10799252"", ""10.1075/btl.17.22via""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'General Health Professions', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

Emerging multifarious narratives of the contagion, which are embedded in peculiar Nigerian socio-religiosity and religious economy, reconstructed the discourses into two complexities: corona disease is an invention of the devil and other dark evil forces, and corona disease is a sign of the end of times. The obvious fabrications escalated uncertainties surrounding the pandemic as well as generated anxiety and fears among potential believers who sermonize spiritual vigilance for the ‘final battle and journey’. Drawing insights from critical discourse analysis, moral panic and frame theory, this study explores discursive means through which the pandemic is represented and reconstructed as long-awaited ‘doomsday’ warning in Nigerian online communities. Findings reveal instances of varying descriptive names, lexical derivations and discursive frames that reflect counter belief and quasi-religious ideologies. The study argues that complex religious doctrines rooted in antichrist or mark of the beast view, socio-religious ideologies of dominionism and overcommernism, cultural and personal linguistic processes have all contributed in shaping and institutionalizing the viral ‘apocalyptic’ world-view of the outbreak.","[{""name"": ""Lily Chimuanya"", ""affiliation"": [""Covenant University Ota""]}, {""name"": ""Ebuka Elias Igwebuike"", ""affiliation"": [""Christian-Albrecht University of Kiel; Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike""]}]","[""10.1163/156853701316931407"", ""10.1057/9780230294783_1"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1991.tb02328.x"", ""10.1177/0011392107081986"", ""10.1126/science.aap9559"", ""10.1177/0963662510393605"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00333.x"", ""10.1386/jams_00056_1""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

More specifically, in this contribution is argued that empirical multimodal analyses of participants’ and interpreters’ behavior in real-life interpreting settings may provide much-needed groundwork that helps to fuel this discussion. As one of the most central points of criticism raised by interpreting practitioners is that distant forms of interpreting lack certain characteristics that are typical for on-site or face-to-face interpreting (i.e. distant solutions are not true-to-life, Van Rotterdam &amp; van den Hoogen 2011). It becomes increasingly important to pinpoint what these typical and natural characteristics are. Empirically grounded insights into these characteristics may then, in a research-technology-application loop, feed into innovative technologies, rendering novel interpreting solutions that are more true-to-life. In this empirical analysis we focus on one specific phenomenon that has received increased attention in the recent literature in multimodal interaction analysis as well as interpreting studies, viz. eye gaze as a semiotic resource employed by speakers as well as hearers. The main questions here are how interpreters typically manage the turn-taking process in real-life interaction, among others by means of gaze, and how important visual access is to the co-participants for a smooth exchange. In order to answer the research questions, the researchers make use of eye-tracking technology to gain detailed information on interpreters’ and primary participants’ gaze behavior.","[{""name"": ""Jelena Vranjes"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Ghent""]}, {""name"": ""Geert Brône"", ""affiliation"": [""KU Leuven""]}]","[""10.1515/text.2005.25.1.7"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2002.tb02562.x"", ""10.1163/9789004458574"", ""10.1075/intp.15.2.03bra"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2016.09.011"", ""10.1007/s10579-014-9283-2"", ""10.1515/cog-2016-0119"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511620539"", ""10.1037/10096-006"", ""10.1016/S0378-2166(02)00025-5"", ""10.1075/intp.15.2.02dav"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2016.04.008"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2012.07.010"", ""10.1075/prag.6.3.07for"", ""10.1075/pbns.92"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628221"", ""10.3389/978-2-88919-825-2"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00098"", ""10.1016/0001-6918(67)90005-4"", ""10.1075/intp.18.2.02kry"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-9077-4_21"", ""10.1017/S004740450332202X"", ""10.1515/applirev-2015-0004"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2016.09.012"", ""10.1075/btl.102.08mas"", ""10.1075/intp.7.2.07mer"", ""10.1177/1461445607075346"", ""10.1111/josl.1_12177"", ""10.7202/011014ar"", ""10.1017/langcog.2015.22"", ""10.1017/S0047404511000479"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2011.08.006"", ""10.1075/intp.12.2.05roz"", ""10.1353/lan.1974.0010"", ""10.1080/08351810903471258"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2018.06.002"", ""10.1075/intp.00028.vra""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'General Health Professions', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

The pre-electoral period was marked by the announcement of boycott from opposition, followed by a number of attempts of ruling party to mitigate the potential negative effects. The decision of opposition to restrain from participation came as a response to the long-term accusations of heavily biased electoral and media conditions, which culminated in EU-mediated (but largely unsuccessful) roundtable talks in 2019. On a larger scale, the administration headed by the President Aleksandar Vučić is becoming increasingly authoritarian, with several indices now classifying Serbia as a hybrid regime. As expected, the elections brought a convincing victory to Vučić’s Serbian Progressive Party, which won 188 out of 250 seats. Despite the overwhelming triumph, government was formed more than four months later. This paper is contributing to the literature on actors’ strategies in hybrid regimes. Although only short-term effects of the boycott could be assessed, the 2020 elections in Serbia demonstrate that legitimacy of the regime cannot be endangered if the opposition is not supported by international actors, and moreover, that the election results have only strengthened the regime.","[{""name"": ""Dejan Bursać"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Political Studies, Serbia""]}, {""name"": ""Dušan Vučićević"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Belgrade, Serbia""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-27693-5_21"", ""10.1080/21599165.2018.1490272"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-22149-2"", ""10.1353/jod.2002.0003"", ""10.2307/2759366"", ""10.1515/9781685858452"", ""10.1353/jod.1995.0049"", ""10.1163/18763332-04201004"", ""10.1177/001041407901200101"", ""10.1353/jod.2002.0026"", ""10.1515/9781685857479-014"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781353"", ""10.1515/9789639776999"", ""10.1353/jod.1994.0010"", ""10.1080/14683857.2019.1672929"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1578815"", ""10.1177/0192512102023001006"", ""10.1515/9781685857479"", ""10.1177/0192512114535450"", ""10.1080/09668136.2019.1669534""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Drawing from various areas of literary, media, and performance studies, including film adaptations of children’s literature, Watchmen and its screen adaptations, and Disney’s live-action remakes, this essay underscores how both nostalgia and adaptation are inherently multivalent concepts, and how they each rely on perspective to generate critical meaning.","[{""name"": ""Colleen Kennedy-Karpat"", ""affiliation"": [""Bilkent University Faculty of Art Design and Architecture, Communication and Design, FADA-COMD, Bilkent Universitesi, Ankara, Universiteler Mah""]}]","[""10.1111/hith.12059"", ""10.1353/nlh.2007.0038"", ""10.1525/fq.2012.66.1.16"", ""10.1111/j.1537-4726.2000.2301_27.x"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.1215/9780822378419"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apu069"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52854-0"", ""10.7560/309001"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apn018"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52854-0_11"", ""10.4324/9780203807125"", ""10.1057/9781137375889"", ""10.4159/9780674042834"", ""10.1002/9781118505526.ch23"", ""10.1080/09502389500490511"", ""10.1525/fq.2017.71.2.32""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

The problems of uncertainty at a time of medical crisis,"This article examines the complex boundaries between ‘fake news’, speculation, hypothesis, gossip and whistleblowing during the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that apparently authoritative sources and experts gave information or policy recommendations that have turned out to be wrong, sometimes dangerously so, and explores the kinds of bias that enter medical advice and planning decisions. The article then diagnoses a WhatsApp voice-note from a young South African doctor that went viral and was denounced as ‘fake news’ because of obvious errors. This note, however, revealed behind the scenes medical thinking about subjects that professional bodies and authorities usually avoid discussing publicly. In highlighting what apparently authoritative sources omit and distort, the article suggests that journalists should report medical advice, even from authoritative sources, with caution and shows that apparently ‘fake’ news may reveal issues other news sources neglect.","[{""name"": ""Ian Glenn"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012284638X University of the Free State""]}]","[""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30739-X"", ""10.1080/13183222.2018.1463047"", ""10.1056/NEJMe2002387"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30411-6"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.11623"", ""10.1111/eci.13222"", ""10.30636/jbpa.31.147"", ""10.1080/10810730590904571"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2005492"", ""10.3961/jpmph.20.094"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2005689"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.5046"", ""10.1386/jams_00049_1""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Emergency Medical Services', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

By the time his work-in-progress solo show,Made in China 2.0,opened at the Asia TOPA Festival in Melbourne, Australia, at the end of that February, it was clear that there would be no live theatre in Wang's hometown of Beijing for some time. All of China was on lockdown as the disease now tragically familiar as COVID-19 swept the country. Then, as Wang returned to Beijing in early March, businesses around the globe were shuttering, theatres were going dark, and theatre artists were confronting an unprecedented challenge to their personal safety, livelihoods, and ability to make meaningful art. In short order, some well-resourced theatre institutions began to stream performance recordings and reconfigure their seasons for online platforms. Only a month after returning home, Wang Chong joined this mass online movement with his production of Samuel Beckett'sWaiting for Godot, streamed live on 5–6 April 2020 asDengdai Geduo.","[{""name"": ""Tarryn Li-Min Chun"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5153/sro.2497"", ""10.1057/9780230275201"", ""10.1162/dram_a_00862"", ""10.1353/atj.2020.0034"", ""10.1353/tj.2009.a380360"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-01985-1"", ""10.1163/9789047401704_010""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Film’s visual experience is thereforetwofold, encompassing a recognitional (the scene presented, the story told, etc.) and a configurational fold (editing, camera movement, etc.). Although some researchers endorse twofoldness with respect to film, there is also significant resistance and misrepresentations of its very nature. This paper argues that the concept is central to an understanding of the basic apprehension and the aesthetic appreciation of film. It demonstrates how twofoldness could play a more substantial role in a new cognitive film theory and a naturalized aesthetics of film. By discussing recent theories of our motor engagement with cinema it shows how referencing to the interplay of two filmic folds could inform such a theory.","[{""name"": ""Joerg Fingerhut"", ""affiliation"": [""Berlin School of Mind and Brain, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany joerg.fingerhut@hu-berlin.de""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780198793533.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794325.001.0001"", ""10.1162/jocn_a_00602"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00365"", ""10.1162/jocn_a_00602"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00365"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198793533.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2008.00295.x"", ""10.2190/EM.29.1.e"", ""10.3167/proj.2017.110103"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316286777"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0211026"", ""10.2307/1225603"", ""10.1086/448116"", ""10.1111/cogs.12439"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0075241"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794325.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199277346.001.0001"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0223896"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0075241"", ""10.1163/22134913-20191095"", ""10.5840/monist200386434"", ""10.3167/proj.2018.120205"", ""10.3167/proj.2018.120205"", ""10.1017/9781108682312.018"", ""10.1524/9783050062389.99"", ""10.7202/024878ar"", ""10.1177/0956797612452866"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00391"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2008.00295.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199862139.001.0001"", ""10.1086/448287"", ""10.2190/EM.29.1.e"", ""10.1524/9783050062389.99"", ""10.3167/proj.2012.060102"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198790648.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2015.01.002"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayq020"", ""10.1163/22134913-20191095"", ""10.3167/proj.2017.110103"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316286777"", ""10.7202/024878ar"", ""10.1007/s11097-011-9219-x"", ""10.1177/0956797612452866"", ""10.1086/448116"", ""10.3167/proj.2012.060102"", ""10.3167/proj.2018.120214"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00391"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199862139.001.0001"", ""10.1086/448287"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0211026"", ""10.3167/proj.2018.120214"", ""10.2307/1225603"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198790648.001.0001"", ""10.5840/monist200386434"", ""10.1111/cogs.12439"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0223896"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2015.01.002"", ""10.1093/0199277346.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayq020"", ""10.1017/9781108682312.018"", ""10.1007/s11097-011-9219-x""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

This is particularly true for developing and newly industrialized countries that often have to deal with poverty and inadequate health systems. A greater awareness of COVID-19 and its consequences, generated and fostered by journalistic health reporting, may contribute to better preparations. The societal importance of journalistic health reporting and its challenges in sub-Saharan societies during the pandemic are examined. A qualitative research design relying on interviews with representatives of African science and health journalism organizations is employed. The results show that health reporting during health crises can provide a variety of normative functions of journalism in democracies and in autocratic developing and newly industrialized countries, but it presents many challenges for journalists and media houses. COVID-19 also offers starting points for global media assistance in strengthening and improving health reporting in the long term.","[{""name"": ""Stefan Wollnik"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121875445 University of Duisburg-Essen""]}]","[""10.3325/cmj.2015.56.496"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-93491-4_9"", ""10.1017/S095026881600039X"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-02427-7_5"", ""10.1057/9781137554505_16"", ""10.1086/267990"", ""10.1056/NEJMra1110897"", ""10.34172/hpp.2020.40"", ""10.1111/j.0021-9916.2007.00326.x"", ""10.1080/15205430701668121"", ""10.18356/6bc7f05a-en""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Musical director John Bronson, actor/singer Jamal James, composer/music director Dionne McClain-Freeney, composer/writer Khiyon Hursey, actor/singer Rheaume Crenshaw, actor/singer/voice teacher Elijah Caldwell, and actor/singer Zonya Love Johnson comprise the group. The artists grapple with the conundrum of sounding ‘Black enough’, how the demand for uniform Black vocalization confounds historical accuracy in period shows, and the fantasy of the generic, idealized ‘Black Broadway voice’. The group details unspoken, misguided industry assumptions that Black singers do not produce multiple kinds of belt sounds, do not use the vocal mix sound, and sing only in a heavy (power) sound virtuosically ornamented with riffs that evokes for (white) listeners a misleadingly monolithic idea of ‘the Black church’. As these artists point out, ‘We do not all go to the same church’; in fact, the ability to fluidly move between more classical (legit) and gospel vocal sounds may actually arise from a singer’s training in the church choir. Collectively these artists have worked on multiple Broadway and off-Broadway shows from The Color Purple to Hamilton and A Strange Loop, major tours and regional productions of shows such as Hair, Ain’t Misbehavin’, and Waitress, and hold songwriting credits from the prestigious BMI musical theatre writing workshop to Netflix.

It argues that the ironic complexities of the Trump figure itself created an unusual situation for satire, one which required it to adapt and change in novel ways. Because Trump was both absurd and terrifying, because he was both parody and credible threat, he created a unique situation for satirists, one where many of the common tools they carry in their comedic toolkit didn’t work. Satirical irony of Trump was not a matter of irony everywhere or ironic post-truthiness; when Trump satire was at its best, it worked in two competing, yet intertwined, representational directions because it was at once a return to sincerely using irony to reveal the truth while also using irony to reveal that reality had become grotesquely and ironically absurd. This essay explores two key examples of this new satirical aesthetic, Sarah Cooper’s interpretations of Trump and Jimmy Kimmel’s use of satire to defend democracy.","[{""name"": ""Sophia A.

Wanzo, and Kristen Warner to discuss issues of medium, genre, fandom, and African American history in the highly regarded HBO series Watchmen. Characterizing the HBO series as a disobedient adaptation that modifies, extends, and redirects the world making of its source material—the famed twelve-issue comic-book series of the same name, written by Alan Moore and drawn by Dave Gibbons (1986–87)—Gillespie et al. explore the ways in which Watchmen remediates American history, starting with the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 that serves as the historical and ideological trigger that sets the series in motion. In a wide-ranging conversation that encompasses subjects including fan fiction, adaptation, cultural mythology, and black superheroes, the authors argue for Watchmen's significance as some of the most consequential television of the century so far.","[{""name"": ""Michael Boyce Gillespie"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

The study used the 2018 Chilanga Constituency by-election campaign messages and those of the 2019 Sesheke constituency to examine the problem. The study drew from the simulation effects (that communication with dissimilar others can encourage incivility and hate online) to assert that political elite campaign messages contribute to incivility/hate and subsequent violence during elections in Zambia. This assumption was tested using 5844 data points collected from various social media platforms owned or purported to be owned by either the Patriotic Front (PF) or the United Party for National Development (UPND) party. The findings support the paper’s hypotheses, and additional analyses suggest that men are more likely to practice incivility online than women. Second, findings suggest that while the PF party’s online platforms exhibit higher trends of partisanship, the UPND tend to privilege tribal affiliations.","[{""name"": ""Gregory Gondwe"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000096214564 University of Colorado Boulder""]}]","[""10.1108/JMD-06-2017-0207"", ""10.1080/10584609.2010.540305"", ""10.1177/0267323115595306"", ""10.2979/africatoday.59.2.81"", ""10.1111/jcom.12104"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00098.x"", ""10.1080/13510347.2017.1394844"", ""10.5897/AJPSIR2017.1052"", ""10.1080/00273171.2014.962683"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.11.034"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2010.550063"", ""10.1080/105846099198541"", ""10.5771/2192-4007-2019-3-311"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199286744.003.0016"", ""10.21617/jprm2021.315"", ""10.1080/14791420.2017.1290262"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2014.940365"", ""10.1080/17512786.2013.813194"", ""10.1386/jams_00032_1""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Gender Studies', 'Communication']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Yet, particular characteristic qualities of the industry remained rather limited up until the last decade, in which vast databases were built up as a consequence of the digital turn. In this study, we develop a relational approach and conduct network analysis to the Yeşilçam with the aim to better understand the patterns of its constitution. Our findings suggest that Yeşilçam was not a homogenous industry as often considered by the film scholarship, rather divided into two main clusters in which professional, narrative and financial dynamics were significantly different.","[{""name"": ""Serkan Savk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Burak Dogu"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Although the existing research has managed to shed some light on the complexity of interpreter-mediated interaction, there is still a lot to be unravelled by adopting a multimodal stance and including non-verbal cues in the analysis of verbal interaction. This study builds on the findings of recent research by Davitti (2013); Davitti &amp; Pasquandrea (2017); Krystallidou (2013, 2014, 2016); Pasquandrea (2011, 2012). In this study, I draw on data taken from a corpus of authentic video-recorded interpreter-mediated consultations at a large urban hospital in Belgium. By applying multimodal analysis to data and comparing it to analysis based on transcripts alone, I highlight a set of interactional dynamics that touch upon new aspects of the complexity of interpreter-mediated interaction and which a transcript-based analysis alone would have failed to capture. It will be shown that participants’ gaze, gestures and body orientation, along with verbal interaction, are used by the interpreter as semiotic resources that do affect the doctor’s and the patient’s participation in interaction. However, the weight the interpreter seems to attach to the primary participants’ semiotic resources seems to be subject to the participation status of each participant.","[{""name"": ""Demi Krystallidou"", ""affiliation"": [""KU Leuven""]}]","[""10.1075/btl.102"", ""10.1007/s00520-010-1046-z"", ""10.1016/S0378-2166(02)00025-5"", ""10.1075/intp.15.2.02dav"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2016.04.008"", ""10.1075/target.15.2.03ing"", ""10.1080/1750399X.2014.972033"", ""10.1075/intp.18.2.02kry"", ""10.1515/applirev-2015-0004"", ""10.1075/btl.102.08mas"", ""10.1075/btl.99.07met"", ""10.1017/S0047404511000479"", ""10.1075/btl.17.21poy"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2958.1998.tb00438.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2010.03906.x"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006017""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

In the context of calls for improving BAME involvement at all levels of the film and television industry, I look in particular at how colour-blind casting has begun to have an impact on British cinema. The article looks initially at how calls for the campaign for changes entwine with the British tradition of public service broadcasting and examines the socially conscious criteria for casting introduced by the BBC and the BFI in 2016. I suggest that some of the ambiguous expectations of audiences in relation to colour-blind casting are similar to the potentially contradictory aspirations placed on institutions which receive public funding. In order to examine these issues in some detail, I draw on textual and paratextual analysis to demonstrate how frames of reference for understanding new approaches to casting can be found in recent period adaptations, a British genre strongly associated with whiteness by actors and critics. The examples discussed span the decade: Wuthering Heights (Arnold, 2011), Lady Macbeth (Oldroyd, 2016), and Mary Queen of Scots (Rourke, 2018). The analysis demonstrates that while casting for the public good is becoming more common it nevertheless remains a complicated and controversial strategy.","[{""name"": ""Christine Geraghty"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Glasgow""]}]","[""10.3366/jbctv.2020.0504"", ""10.1515/9781474441650-024"", ""10.1057/9780230596290"", ""10.1080/15405702.2013.810081"", ""10.1080/10486801.2014.946921"", ""10.1057/9781137262875"", ""10.4324/9780203944332"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2016.0308"", ""10.4324/9781315779829""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

While taking into account Dumbo’s uncomfortable incorporation of minstrelsy and Disney’s larger problems of racial representation, Gates pushes for a complex reading of the film that situates blackness at the core of its affective connection.","[{""name"": ""Racquel Gates"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

The primary argument asserts that specific, mandated-content assessments do not help newly trained teachers to develop skills and knowledge related to thoughtfulness, criticality, cultural responsiveness, and caring for the young individuals with whom they work. The author attributes this to the lack of intercultural sensitivity and intercultural communication in teacher education discourses. Researchers suggest that caring in schools and other such institutions have diminished as there are distinct gaps in the relationships between teachers and culturally diverse students causing these students to fall out of the school systems. The chapter informs about the need to equip teachers with intercultural sensitivities and intercultural communication skills to help them navigate the changing demographics in classrooms. Finally, it provides some insight into discovering missing links in teaching and pedagogical approaches and offers some strategies for bridging the ever-widening intercultural gaps.","[{""name"": ""Sapna Thapa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0963721411434980"", ""10.1002/tea.1035"", ""10.4135/9781452231129.n6"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1177/002205749117300305"", ""10.1177/1057083711427587"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.122.1.5"", ""10.1177/0022487105285962"", ""10.2307/358178"", ""10.1177/0013124510380718"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-54389-5_2"", ""10.1177/0022487104263080"", ""10.1207/s15326993es3803_7"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2015.02.001"", ""10.1007/s10943-014-9983-3"", ""10.1177/0022487115624739"", ""10.1177/2043610616664622"", ""10.1177/0022487109347670"", ""10.1016/S0147-1767(03)00034-8"", ""10.1080/0951839032000060635"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2016.07.018"", ""10.1111/1468-5906.00177"", ""10.3138/jcfs.29.2.297"", ""10.1111/1467-6494.696169"", ""10.1177/0022487107305603"", ""10.1177/0022487105285893""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

A disputed presidential election in 2011 in Uganda prompted opposition politicians to call nationwide protests. The architects of the protests hoped this would eventually lead to the downfall of Museveni’s newly elected government. The ‘Pads4Girls’ campaign on the other hand, was spearheaded by a female academic activist and provoked unprecedented response from politicians across the political divide, activists and unaffiliated individuals who added weight to the campaign.

This case of study identifies that the media coverage adopted a more predominantly political frame rather than a social or human frame. Also, there were significant differences between the presence of migrant and non-migrant news sources, while non-migrant speakers were not judgmental regarding migration. Likewise, news framing influences the selection of news coverage. The political frame over-represented the political actors and international institutions and under-represented migrants. Nevertheless, when it comes to the human-interest angle, migrants are the most common sources.

How the European New Right imagines a post-liberal world order,"Far-right parties and pundits are often portrayed as parochial nationalists obsessed with the idea of national sovereignty. Opposed to a liberal world order, they prefer a rogue world of nation-states on the loose. This essay seeks to complicate that narrative. It suggests that alongside political parties with a nationalist agenda, an increasing number of voices on the radical Right are now pushing for a re-spiritualized world order in which cultures, civilizations, and empires are to set the scene. This vision of global order echoes Christopher Coker’s recent claim that “we now live in a world in which civilization is fast becoming the currency of international politics.” But, why does this strand of the far-right prefer civilizations to nation-states? To ponder this question, this essay zooms in on the European New Right and more precisely two of its main luminaries, Alain de Benoist and Aleksandr Dugin. It shows how the New Right stretches back to classical geopolitics to imagine a future polycentric world order in which large civilizations are set free from American hegemony. The empires of the future are no longer underpinned by nation-states but by ethnopluralism—a “blossoming variety” of local, ethnic, agrarian polities.","[{""name"": ""Manni Crone"", ""affiliation"": [""Danish Institute for International Studies, København, Denmark""]}]","[""10.1093/ips/olaa001"", ""10.1353/sor.2013.0020"", ""10.1080/14782800802500981"", ""10.1111/j.1749-5687.2010.00102.x"", ""10.1080/14650040701305609"", ""10.2747/1539-7216.50.2.131"", ""10.1017/S0037677900024566"", ""10.1017/S0260210519000159"", ""10.1177/0263276406067095"", ""10.3817/0393099081"", ""10.1017/S175297191800012X"", ""10.1017/S0260210521000103"", ""10.4324/9781315626628-8"", ""10.3817/0393099127"", ""10.1080/00168890903291443"", ""10.2307/20045621"", ""10.1093/ia/iix241"", ""10.1177/0309132513517989"", ""10.1111/1467-8675.12126"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190877583.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511521782"", ""10.1080/21567689.2019.1697870"", ""10.1111/1467-8675.12127"", ""10.1080/09668136.2017.1285009"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1131grs"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674726383"", ""10.4324/9781315628059""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Through defining and highlighting some land-based processes performed by Monique Mojica (Guna and Rappahannock) and herself, she demonstrates how some Indigenous theatre artists are exploding notions of ‘the well-made play.’ As an Algonquin Anishinaabe theatre artist, Lachance looks to birchbark biting as a starting point when building a dramaturgical process. This article paddles down a river, exploring how individuals and collectives investigate and actually use cultural material, objects, familial teachings, and place as artistic collaborators when creating theatrical works. To conclude, the article describes how Lachance navigated working with land-based principles during an online play development workshop of Yolanda Bonnell’s (Anishinaabe) My Sister’s Rage during the COVID-19 pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Lindsay Lachance"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"
10.1386/jac_00028_1,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN CINEMAS,1303 Drama Film and Television,The persistent instructor: 45 years of Kofi the Good Farmer in Ghana,"In 1950, the Gold Coast colonial government published the 52-page pamphlet titled Kofi the Good Farmer. In 1953, it was adapted into a thirteen-minute instructional film of the same name. The film, like the booklet, follows a farmer named Kofi as he demonstrates proper cocoa-farming methods. Depicted as a remote, rural farmer who becomes successful because of his implementation of foreign farming techniques and his acceptance of the colonial government’s authority to determine and control the cocoa grading scale, Kofi provides evidence of paternalism and racialist colonial rhetoric in British colonial filmmaking. However, 34 years after the making of Kofi, it was re-shown to rural audiences. Why was a dutiful colonial subject like Kofi instructing cocoa farmers over 30 years after Ghana’s independence? And what can his use by the postcolonial state tell us about national governance? This article argues that the persistent use of Kofi by Ghana reveals the entangled relationship between colonialism and nationalism in postcolonial governance. Following the subtle changes that Kofi has undergone in his 45 years of government service, I highlight how government-sponsored films construct their audiences as remote in order to reinforce the power of the state in moments of political uncertainty.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Blaylock"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Film and Media Arts, Cleveland State University""]}]","[""10.3366/E000197200900103X"", ""10.1080/01439688300260101"", ""10.1386/jac_00028_1""]",['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

10.1093/adaptation/apab020,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,The Woman Writer on Film and the #MeToo Literary Biopic,"Abstract This article focuses on the representation of female authors’ lives in English-language literary biopics and how these representations relate to feminist contexts. Departing from previous research on biopics focusing on women (particularly women writers), this article identifies four categories of such films: the patriarchal literary biopic, in which the representation of an author’s life is related to patriarchal values, the second-wave feminist literary biopic, which is related to second-wave feminism, the postfeminist literary biopic, which is related to postfeminism, and finally the #MeToo literary biopic, a new category of films that has recently begun to emerge. By analyzing the films Colette (Wash Westmoreland, 2018) and Wild Nights with Emily (Madeleine Olnek, 2019), this article shows how these films correspond to the #MeToo movement. The #MeToo literary biopic is characterized by (a) excessive attention to difficult publication processes and the disclosure of women’s words, (b) emphasizing the persistent censoring of women’s words, (c) deconstructing the myths surrounding female authors, and (d) underscoring (female) solidarity and empowerment.","[{""name"": ""Katrijn Bekers"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Antwerp , Antwerp , Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Gertjan Willems"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Antwerp , Antwerp , Belgium"", ""Ghent University , Ghent , Belgium""]}]","[""10.1080/15210960.2019.1657707"", ""10.1057/9781137317230"", ""10.1080/13552074.2018.1540197"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apu034"", ""10.1057/9781137317230_3"", ""10.4324/9780203146804"", ""10.4324/9781003014645"", ""10.1080/14748932.2018.1389002"", ""10.1080/08952833.2019.1637088"", ""10.4324/9780203980781"", ""10.1057/9781137273482"", ""10.1177/1464700111429900"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-18850-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25689-0_13"", ""10.1080/24720038.2019.1588277"", ""10.1057/9780230523173_8"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-37761-6"", ""10.1093/screen/hjm004""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.3366/film.2021.0176,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,"The Human Chameleon: Zelig, Nietzsche and the Banality of Evil","This article revisits the case of Woody Allen’s mockumentary Zelig (1983) via Friedrich Nietzsche’s diagnostic of mimicry in The Gay Science. It argues that the case of the “human chameleon” remains contemporary for both philosophical and political reasons. On the philosophical side, I argue that the case of Zelig challenges an autonomous conception of the subject based on rational self-sufficiency (or Homo Sapiens) by proposing a relational conception of the subject open to mimetic influences (or homo mimeticus) that will have to await the discovery of mirror neurons in the 1990s in order to find an empirical confirmation. On the political side, I say that Zelig foregrounds the power of authoritarian leaders in the 1930s to cast a spell on both imitative crowds and publics in terms that provide a mimetic supplement to Hannah Arendt’s account of the “banality of evil”. The philosophical purchase of Zelig’s cinematic dramatization of a mimetic subject is that it reveals how the “inability to think” (Hannah Arendt) characteristic of the case of Eichmann rests on unnoticed affective principles constitutive of the all-too-human penchant for “mimicry” (Nietzsche) the film dramatises. Thus reframed, the human chameleon reflects (on) the dangers of mimetic dispossessions that reached massive proportions in the past century and continue to cast a shadow on the present century.","[{""name"": ""Nidesh Lawtoo"", ""affiliation"": [""KU Leuven""]}]","[""10.4324/9781351034944"", ""10.2307/778354"", ""10.1353/sho.1998.0015"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198793533.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10509200500486403"", ""10.4324/9781351034944-2"", ""10.14321/j.ctvj4swcr"", ""10.1177/1065912920911201"", ""10.4102/lit.v13i3.775"", ""10.1093/screen/42.2.142""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.3366/film.2023.0226,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,The Colour of Film-Philosophy,"This article draws upon the work of Sylvia Wynter and W.E.B. Du Bois in order to propose that film-philosophy has historically not paid due attention to race. Drawing upon the former’s concept of “the sociogenic principle”, as well as the latter’s theories of “the colour line” and “double-consciousness”, the article argues that modernity has been constructed coterminously with whiteness, as well as a “photographic/cinematographic” logic whereby Blackness is cast into a “negative” realm. That is, while modernity might be white, more specifically it is antiblack. For film-philosophy ethically to evolve, then, it must not just pursue a dewesternising turn to the global, as suggested by various scholars, but it must also reckon with antiblackness and the role that cinema has played in constructing and reaffirming a white (and therefore antiblack) world. By this token, recent engagements with objects and animals similarly do not often consider race as a structuring concept of and for the human, in distinction to which both objects and animals supposedly exist. Indeed, one might even construe the contemporary emphasis on objects and animals among primarily white western scholars as a refusal to consider race with the critical rigour that it merits. This article goes some way towards introducing such critical rigour as developed among scholars in critical race theory, in particular Black Studies, especially Du Bois and Wynter; and it proposes that the application of such work to film will radically alter how we consider the medium. In this way, the article draws out the (white) colour of film-philosophy, and argues for a racially conscious/conscientious film-philosophy that will thus be worthy of the name.","[{""name"": ""William Brown"", ""affiliation"": [""University of British Columbia""]}]","[""10.1177/0021934716638802"", ""10.2307/j.ctv12101zq"", ""10.1111/hypa.12492"", ""10.1215/23289252-3815069"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816676408.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1131d8k"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226261546.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226278735.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9781478002239"", ""10.1525/fq.2019.72.3.13"", ""10.2307/3041693"", ""10.1515/9781474423427"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479890040.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00064246.2013.11413675"", ""10.1215/9780822390145"", ""10.1215/9780822375647"", ""10.1215/9780822381372"", ""10.5040/9781472546319"", ""10.4324/9781315694832"", ""10.1215/08992363-15-1-11"", ""10.1163/23523085-00403001"", ""10.5040/9781628929188"", ""10.1353/cal.2016.0035"", ""10.1353/cj.2017.0026"", ""10.1525/aa.1995.97.3.02a00090"", ""10.1080/13688790.2010.526539"", ""10.1353/cj.2019.0012"", ""10.5406/illinois/9780252039591.001.0001"", ""10.1215/07990537-3481546"", ""10.1111/johs.12124"", ""10.1215/9780822376491"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11cw61k"", ""10.2307/1212758"", ""10.2307/302808"", ""10.2307/40145557"", ""10.1353/ncr.2004.0015""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

10.1215/02705346-9561395,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Not New to This: A Genealogical Approach to Black Girls' Media Production,"Abstract During the nineteenth and early to mid-twentieth centuries, the Black press served as a cornerstone of Black social and political life in the United States. For Black Americans, newspapers and magazines functioned as both informational resources and philosophical spaces that engaged conversations of racial uplift, which often centered Black girlhood as an especially important site for assessing racial progress. Despite the evolving nature of media platforms themselves, the relationship between media and Black Americans continues to be a tool by which to measure the pulse of Black life; the role of digital media in the lives of twenty-first-century Black Americans mirrors that of Black magazines and newspapers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Of particular note is the way that Black youth, especially Black girls, use digital media spaces to make themselves (and their experiences) visible and generate social discourse through the content they post on social media. In this article, I look at historical Black titles—the Woman's Era and the Brownies’ Book—as well as contemporary Black girls’ social media content to show how Black girls have historically developed a discourse of Black girlhood alongside their adult counterparts who were concerned with racial uplift and continue to author and theorize their lives through digital media.","[{""name"": ""Ashleigh Greene Wade"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We describe the characteristics of contemporary ‘intellectual activism’ and the growing network of small civil and political groups in today’s Russia. We show that Russian civil society remains fragile and fragmented; the public discussion is not focused on strategies of resistance to arbitrariness but on constructing moral categories such as the wide and vague concept of ‘new ethics’. We also show how outsiders appear among contemporary Russian dissidents, who are not supported by most independent leaders and intellectuals – these are young ‘new leftists’ and feminist activist groups. These political activists find themselves under pressure from both the siloviki and the authorities, and in the focus of criticism of opposition leaders, becoming, in fact, dissidents among dissidents in contemporary Russia.","[{""name"": ""Jan Surman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department for the History of the Academy of Sciences, Masaryk Institute and Archives of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic""]}, {""name"": ""Ella Rossman"", ""affiliation"": [""SSEES UCL, London""]}]","[""10.1126/sciadv.abe5641"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-20401-3"", ""10.15593/2224-9354/2021.2.6"", ""10.4324/9781315816470"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190066338.001.0001"", ""10.1017/slr.2017.77"", ""10.5771/9781786605979"", ""10.1057/s41599-020-00550-7"", ""10.4324/9781315657431-7"", ""10.1038/d41586-021-00385-5""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

A new vogue for science fiction, a genre that has taken off in China alongside the country's stratospheric growth, suggests that China is ready to take up the baton of galactic discovery adventure. Chris Berry examines the father-son narratives in The Wandering Earth (Frant Gwo, 2019) and Nova (Cao Fei, 2019), two recent films that link Chinese patriarchy to the triumph and trials of modern science and progress. The Wandering Earth reaffirms those dominant models in action adventure mode, while Nova's melancholic wanderings are ambivalent and even mournful.

10.1515/jcde-2021-0003,JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY DRAMA IN ENGLISH,1303 Drama Film and Television,More Future? Straight Ecologies in British Climate-Change Theatre,"AbstractAttempts to convey the urgency of the climate crisis often rely on the figure of the child. From Greta Thunberg via school-striking students to the grandchildren invoked in the titles of bestselling books about global warming, appearances of children seem especially effective in protesting the loss of a habitable planet. The iconic child that needs saving (or becomes the planet’s saviour) is equally prominent in British plays about climate change. Drawing on queer critiques of the conceptual short circuit between the child and the future, this article identifies two waves of UK eco-theatre: the first wave endorses hetero-nuclear family bonds and future-oriented thinking; the second wave traces alternative relations to nonhuman, ageing, or ailing Others in the present. The first part of the article revisits critiques of reproductive futurism; the second examines the straight ecologies that characterise the first wave of eco-theatre, based on a detailed analysis of Duncan Macmillan’s playLungs(Studio Theatre, Washington, DC/Sheffield Crucible, 2011). The final part considers climate-change plays that sever reproductive timelines, as exemplified by Caryl Churchill’sEscaped Alone, Lucy Kirkwood’sThe Children, and Stef Smith’sHuman Animals(all Royal Court, 2016).","[{""name"": ""Ariane de Waal"", ""affiliation"": [""Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg Germany""]}]","[""10.1515/jcde-2020-0003"", ""10.1515/jcde-2015-0002"", ""10.5040/9781784603595.00000002"", ""10.2307/j.ctv47w5sc.6"", ""10.5040/9781350432864.00000003"", ""10.1215/9780822385981"", ""10.2307/j.ctv47w5sc.5"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11cw25q"", ""10.1515/jcde-2020-0007"", ""10.1017/S0266464X12000449"", ""10.1002/wcc.385"", ""10.18357/jcs.v43i1.18263"", ""10.5040/9781350081130"", ""10.5040/9781350208056.00000003"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199742929.013.015"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816689873.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781784603779.00000002"", ""10.1080/10486801.2013.765119""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"
10.3138/md.63.3.1076,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Matters of the Heart: The Poetics of Trauma in Harold Pinter's Ashes to Ashes,"Harold Pinter’s Ashes to Ashes, comprising an extended dialogue between two protagonists, Rebecca and Devlin, repeatedly returns to a “guide” who steals babies from their mothers at a railway station. This image has led Pinter scholars to interpret the play as a representation of the Shoah and its impact on Pinter’s life. However, during the play’s conclusion, Rebecca assumes the position of one of the mothers and, while ventriloquizing her, disavows the existence of her child at the very moment when another woman asks her to confirm the infant’s whereabouts. Rather than maintaining the customary position that Ashes to Ashes represents a specific historical atrocity, I read the play’s engagement with trauma through the figure of this abducted, but ultimately disowned, infant. Specifically, I attend to how the infant’s disappearance informs the poetic qualities of Ashes to Ashes as its heartbeat figures prominently throughout the play, resonates in its dialogue, and organizes its rhythmic structure. By examining how these poetic features situate Rebecca’s mode of listening as an exemplary ethico-political response to suffering, I propose an alternative to the interpretation of Pinter’s use of dramatic speech in terms of referentiality or language games.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CCOL0521651239.016"", ""10.1515/9780748642236"", ""10.56021/9781421421650"", ""10.3138/md.2012-0494"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-50816-4"", ""10.1353/aim.1998.0017"", ""10.1353/dis.2004.0009"", ""10.5325/haropintrevi.1.1.0013"", ""10.1057/9781137297570_3"", ""10.5325/haropintrevi.1.1.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

This paper describes how Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, has emerged as the role model of international right-wing populism. It demonstrates that Orbán actively supplied himself as an example that like-minded politicians should follow. We draw on the concept of legitimation strategies to illustrate why Orbán markets himself as the leader of an international movement against liberal ideologues (Wajner, 2022). At the same time, populists in many countries have searched abroad for a successful model to follow. Orbán’s anti-migration policies and his defense of conservative family values constitute chapters of an illiberal playbook that right-wing populists are eager to implement. We use the concept of authoritarian learning to develop this demand-side perspective (Hall and Ambrosio, 2017). Empirically, we demonstrate our argument through an analysis of speeches delivered at a leading gathering of right-wing populists and moral conservatives: the Hungarian editions of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) that took place in Budapest in 2022 and 2023.","[{""name"": ""Martijn Mos"", ""affiliation"": [""Leiden University, Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Igor Macedo Piovezan"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Groningen, Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1093/ips/olaa001"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0273951"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000337"", ""10.1177/13540661221084871"", ""10.1353/jod.2022.0018"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.5749/j.ctttstd7"", ""10.1080/07036337.2019.1665660"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190916473.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0032321719847576"", ""10.1353/sais.2017.0007"", ""10.1017/S0260210519000159"", ""10.1017/S0260210519000184"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0066"", ""10.1080/03050620304593"", ""10.1017/S0260210515000492"", ""10.1177/0268580907084388"", ""10.1017/nps.2020.83"", ""10.1080/21599165.2017.1307826"", ""10.1057/jird.2014.9"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1302491"", ""10.1093/ia/iiad110"", ""10.1017/S0020818300028198"", ""10.1080/13569317.2023.2250744"", ""10.1080/14650045.2022.2104158"", ""10.1177/00471178231186392"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1724965"", ""10.1080/10758216.2022.2050927"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2015.1014197"", ""10.1017/S1537592721001924"", ""10.1093/isagsq/ksac027"", ""10.1080/23745118.2021.1956239"", ""10.1080/03932729.2023.2225660"", ""10.1177/1354068819849888"", ""10.1017/9781009030915"", ""10.1177/0305829815581870"", ""10.1177/0896920519894051"", ""10.2307/3234268"", ""10.1177/13691481211066970"", ""10.1017/S1755773920000363"", ""10.1017/9781108348621"", ""10.1177/08969205211057020"", ""10.1177/13691481211069345"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-80803-7_21"", ""10.1093/isr/viz007"", ""10.1080/09668136.2020.1784394""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

To understand the sociocultural repercussions of these representations I first contextualize them by exploring current cultural theories behind trends in production and acquisition practices. I argue that by conforming to 'universalized' format and audience standards individual nations achieve transnational visibility. In turn, this universalization contributes to the transnational validation of the narrative discourses within these television programmes. As such, the depictions of LGBTQ characters on the shows Suburra, Gomorrah, Baby and SKAM Italia legitimize a certain level of sexual and gender variance while simultaneously endorsing acts of discrimination against those within these minority categories.","[{""name"": ""Julia Heim"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000086144275 University of Pennsylvania""]}]","[""10.1177/0002764211398078"", ""10.1353/cj.2001.0009"", ""10.1080/15295039109366779"", ""10.1386/jicms_00016_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Building on the work of Thomas Leitch and Sarah Cardwell in adaptation studies and Christopher Kelty in the anthropology of the hacker movement, the essay positions itself as an alternative to Douglas Lanier’s model of the Shakespeare rhizome. The central argument is that understanding Shakespeare’s works as source code, and adaptations of them as hacks of that source code, as well as sources of future hacks, makes it possible to account for and work with the difficult but crucial notions of the source and of fidelity, while resolving many of the theoretical, practical, and political problems which motivated scholars to avoid or try to overcome those notions in the past.","[{""name"": ""Reto Winckler"", ""affiliation"": [""South China Normal University""]}]","[""10.5040/9781472530790"", ""10.56021/9780801828065"", ""10.1353/nlh.2007.0038"", ""10.4324/9781315690254-3"", ""10.4324/9780203942147"", ""10.1515/9781400845293"", ""10.1177/1463499608093814"", ""10.1080/17450918.2015.1012550"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803406"", ""10.1093/screen/20.1.13"", ""10.5040/9781350928541"", ""10.1017/CCOL9780521844291.002"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apv014"", ""10.1215/9780822389002"", ""10.4324/9780203167717"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262062749.003.0034"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199331000.001.0001"", ""10.9783/9780812205770"", ""10.5040/9781501318757"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226464589.001.0001"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apq010"", ""10.4324/9780203807125"", ""10.4324/9780203069103"", ""10.1057/9780230584549_2"", ""10.1177/1469540509354673"", ""10.5040/9798400636516"", ""10.1515/9789048534012-002""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Research examining malign information influence is growing, but more attention could be given to its psychological effects. Information operations are commonly assumed to affect the levels of trust and the emotional experiences of citizens who are targeted by them, but these notions are currently supported by limited evidence. We propose that experimental psychological research is a promising avenue to more clearly demonstrate these effects and individual differences of the target audience that may exacerbate these effects. This article discusses the knowledge gap regarding the psychological effects of malign information influence and suggests relevant psychological research that can be built upon when devising experimental studies that might address it. Finally, the article outlines key benefits that insights gleaned from this experimental research would offer to those seeking to counter malign information influence.","[{""name"": ""Aiden Hoyle"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands; TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research), The Netherlands; Netherlands Defense Academy, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Helma van den Berg"", ""affiliation"": [""TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research), The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Bertjan Doosje"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Martijn Kitzen"", ""affiliation"": [""Netherlands Defense Academy, The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1057/9780230592100_14"", ""10.1080/14702436.2019.1597631"", ""10.1080/09592318.2016.1151653"", ""10.1007/s12144-003-1011-9"", ""10.1145/3274289"", ""10.1073/pnas.1906420116"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.07.026"", ""10.2478/jobs-2018-0008"", ""10.1080/09592310802462273"", ""10.1057/ap.2012.27"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2015.1116277"", ""10.1177/2336825X20935244"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.752"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04621-7_4"", ""10.1080/14702436.2016.1256209"", ""10.30966/2018.RIGA.8.3."", ""10.1177/1750635220965622"", ""10.1080/09557571.2020.1719038"", ""10.1080/13183222.2018.1418819"", ""10.1080/13216597.2020.1817122"", ""10.1007/978-94-6265-189-0_9"", ""10.1177/0146167205284282"", ""10.1080/01296612.2017.1384145"", ""10.3758/MC.38.8.1087"", ""10.7249/RR2779"", ""10.1080/05679320600661640"", ""10.1007/s11109-012-9216-y"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edaa004"", ""10.1177/0093650216644026"", ""10.1080/10584609.2020.1723754"", ""10.7249/RRA704-3"", ""10.1080/03071847.2020.1727156"", ""10.1111/bjop.12018"", ""10.1111/bjop.12385"", ""10.1111/bjso.12394"", ""10.1080/17512786.2016.1163237"", ""10.1177/1940161218786426"", ""10.7249/RR1498"", ""10.1057/s41311-020-00215-x"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12509"", ""10.1017/eis.2019.6"", ""10.1177/1077699015596338"", ""10.1016/j.jarmac.2017.07.008"", ""10.1177/1529100612451018"", ""10.1037/a0034515"", ""10.1177/0093650215577859"", ""10.4324/9781315871264"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1646778"", ""10.1163/1871191X-11411019"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2016.1146452"", ""10.1007/978-94-6265-222-4_14"", ""10.1037/xge0000465"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60214-2"", ""10.1177/009365097024005002"", ""10.1111/spsr.12261"", ""10.1080/23800992.2019.1695666"", ""10.17645/pag.v5i4.1124"", ""10.1177/1750635213516696"", ""10.1080/09546553.2020.1803288"", ""10.1177/0539018417734419"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2014.981513"", ""10.1080/10584609.2017.1316807"", ""10.1080/10584609.2020.1736700"", ""10.1177/1077699013514414"", ""10.1145/3359229"", ""10.1177/0192512113492599"", ""10.1111/pops.12513"", ""10.1126/science.aap9559"", ""10.1080/09662839.2020.1771695"", ""10.1177/1750635219884343"", ""10.1080/1553118X.2019.1630413"", ""10.1111/jcom.12164"", ""10.1145/3274452"", ""10.1037/pac0000126"", ""10.11610/Connections.15.2.06"", ""10.1080/14702436.2020.1718498"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12097""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.3366/film.2020.0138,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,Given (No) Time: A Derridean Reading of Denis Villeneuve's Arrival,"The central character of Denis Villeneuve's 2016 film Arrival, Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), is a linguist tasked with deciphering a logographic alien language in time to avert a seemingly impending global war. I argue that the alien heptapods' logographs exemplify the understanding of language advanced by Jacques Derrida in seminal texts such as Of Grammatology (1976), while also engaging some of the themes concerning time and gift-giving that he develops in later, more explicitly political works. Derrida argues that written signifiers, rather than being a mere vehicle for representing speech, confer their own, supplemental meaning onto communication. Furthermore, he emphasizes that writing is not bound by the same linear temporality as spoken utterances, inasmuch as it is inscribed in a format which allows it to be revisited repeatedly. The significance of this disruption of linear temporality becomes clear in Derrida's later works such as Specters of Marx (1994) and On Cosmopolitanism (2001), where he describes such disruption as a necessary condition for the type of political change he believes is needed in the world. The ability to experience time in a nonlinear fashion allows Banks to prevent the looming war, in an illustration of the connection that Derrida draws between time, violence, and politics. However, it also puts humanity in the heptapods' debt, thus exemplifying the paradox of genuine gift-giving that Derrida claims is impossible. Despite the complex ethical questions it invokes, however, the unique nature of the gift in Arrival signals that this gift might be a genuinely altruistic offering after all.","[{""name"": ""Gina Zavota"", ""affiliation"": [""Kent State University""]}]","[""10.13110/discourse.37.1-2.0022"", ""10.1353/nlh.2011.0033"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2303.2012.00650.x"", ""10.2307/465146"", ""10.5840/ipq201252215"", ""10.13110/discourse.37.1-2.0063"", ""10.1146/annurev.anthro.36.081406.094357"", ""10.5040/9781628928891"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748640270.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.3366/jbctv.2020.0505,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,Funky Days Are (Not) Back Again: Cool Britannia and the Rise and Fall of British South Asian Cultural Production,"This article explores the conditions that led to the rise and fall of British South Asian cultural production. Following a high point in the 1990s when for the first time a South Asian diasporic presence was felt in British popular culture, across television, film, music, literature and theatre, Asians have now returned to the periphery of the cultural industries. But this is not a simple case of British Asians falling in and out of fashion. Rather, as this article explores, British Asian cultural producers were enabled but then ultimately constrained by shifts in cultural policy (and specifically ‘creative industries’ policy) and, more broadly, by the politics of multiculturalism in the UK and beyond. In particular, it focuses on the moment of New Labour and ‘Cool Britannia’ as a significant cultural and political moment that led to the rise and subsequent demise of British Asian cultural production. Through such an analysis the article adds to the growing body of work on race and production studies. It demonstrates the value of the historical approach, outlined by the ‘cultural industries’ tradition of political economy, which is interested in how historical forces come together to produce a particular set of institutional and social arrangements that shape the practices of British Asian creative workers. While the article foregrounds television and film, it explores the field of British Asian cultural production more broadly and, in doing so, marks the ascendency of the ‘diversity discourse’ that characterises cultural policy in the present day.","[{""name"": ""Anamik Saha"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09502380902950914"", ""10.1163/9789004652002_010"", ""10.5153/sro.719"", ""10.1353/aq.2013.0058"", ""10.1093/hwj/1999.48.187"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2016.05.002"", ""10.18574/nyu/9780814737200.001.0001"", ""10.1080/15405702.2013.810068"", ""10.1057/9781137426383"", ""10.1177/1103308803011001074"", ""10.1080/01419870.2011.629002"", ""10.4324/9780203480250"", ""10.3998/mij.15031809.0002.205"", ""10.5040/9781350223035"", ""10.4324/9781315712802"", ""10.4135/9781446220603"", ""10.1093/screen/hjn041"", ""10.1080/15405702.2013.810081"", ""10.2307/j.ctv36xw4tq.5"", ""10.3898/136266205820466869"", ""10.1080/10286632.2011.561334"", ""10.1080/14682753.2015.1015802"", ""10.1177/1367877904040606"", ""10.1080/09548960600922335"", ""10.1080/09548963.2016.1170943""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.3366/jbctv.2021.0576,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,Framing the Non-human: American Honey as Eco-Road Movie,"This article approaches Andrea Arnold's American Honey (2016) as a contemporary manifestation of an eco-road movie. Although the film's expansive interest in the ‘natural’ environment and its non-human inhabitants aligns it with Arnold's earlier work, American Honey is unique for its complex engagement with the cinematic traditions of Hollywood genre films. I argue that Arnold's eco-aesthetics work to conflate the distinctions between human and non-human worlds, offering a de-romanticisation of the American picturesque vistas and exploring the intersections of human speciesism, masculinity and whiteness, as well as narratives of conquest and ownership. I focus on the ways in which the film both participates in and exceeds Arnold's previous ecocinematic approach in filming British landscape, while at the same time highlighting her distinctive contribution to the tradition of the road movie. If the conventional road movie tends to offer a sense of escape from the capitalist dystopia, American Honey displaces such a promise. In its complex treatment of the supposedly distinct realms of nature and culture, the film does not endorse a return to the mythical wild but, rather, draws attention to the messiness of ecological, social and economic entanglements, exposing both neoliberal and anthropocentric power structures. Ultimately, it is through the intertwining of the film's ecological orientation and its engagement with the conventions of the road movie and its antecedent, the Western, that such a critique is possible.","[{""name"": ""Katarzyna Paszkiewicz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5749/minnesota/9780816621958.001.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520943902"", ""10.1215/9780822391623"", ""10.46863/ecocene.2020.3"", ""10.1080/17503175.2019.1578190"", ""10.4324/9780203279328"", ""10.1177/026327695012001003"", ""10.1515/9781474413046"", ""10.1093/screen/hjaa014"", ""10.1215/9780822373780"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2016.0305"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2016.0306"", ""10.1093/isle/11.2.107"", ""10.1093/screen/hjv007"", ""10.1093/screen/hjv006"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474446389.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674056732"", ""10.3167/9781785330001"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2016.0308"", ""10.1515/9780773550391""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

This study examines how the strength of ISC (how similarly brains respond) varies over the course of a Pixar short film: specifically comparing this across the exposition, rising action, climax/fall out, and resolution sections of the story. We focus on ISC in the mentalizing network, often linked to social-cognitive processes that are essential to narrative engagement. We find that ISC rises from exposition to the climax. Moreover, we explore this shared response across age groups, finding that ISC is present across age groups, albeit weak in younger children. This approach offers new insights into the brain basis of engagement and story structure.","[{""name"": ""Sara M.

The need to address the dynamics of diversity is acute in many countries, not only those that struggle with the so-called migrant crisis and the often-accompanying xenophobia, populism and social disharmony. As the Spanish sociologist Manuel Castells (2010) points out, the increasing diversity of societies does not only enrich cultures, but may also hold the potential to fuel fundamentalism, radicalization and polarization. As a response, UNESCO highlights that these new challenges of “intolerance, prejudice and misunderstanding, social fragmentation, violent extremism” are “not a matter for governments alone, but for all segments of society, including universities, civil society and the private sector” (Mansouri 2017, 3). According to Castells, the sources of legitimizing identities that the nation-state once promoted are now drained away and the very concept of nation-state is called into question. Consequently, he sees the notion of political democracy, central to nationhood, to be in crisis. UNESCO therefore calls for intercultural dialogue to enhance learning to live together (Mansouri 2017), and the European Union urges its member-states to establish visions and policies that foster intercultural co-existence, collaboration and education to help in the complex and challenging work of building a common ground for the future (Vision Europe Summit 2016).","[{""name"": ""Heidi Westerlund"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sidsel Karlsen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/1-4020-4773-8"", ""10.22176/act16.3.78"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199679485.003.0027"", ""10.4337/9781784715328.00007""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Interviews with industry practitioners establish the dominance of the Hollywood paradigm at the government screen agencies and in industry discourse, but its weak uptake by some of Australia’s most successful screenwriters. A link between national mythology, national narratives and a distinctly Australian idiom in screenwriting is investigated.

While this usually applies to systems whose survival is seen in a positive light (such as democracy), this article emphasizes the other, darker side of this phenomenon. I demonstrate how anti-corruption discourse can support certain practices that actually contribute to the resilience of corruption. By comparing the anti-corruption discourses of the Russian government and its political opposition, this article shows the interdependence and mutual reinforcement of two practices: (I) the pervasive resolution of everyday problems by corrupt methods and (II) focusing on the corruption of particular actors as the main obstacle to the development of the country and society. The effect of this interdependence is ambivalent, as both practices challenge corruption and contribute to its resilience. In effect, this becomes a mode of government and I link the concept of resilience with the literature on governmentality to better illuminate the endurance of corruption in Russia despite sincere (and even well-intended) anti-corruption campaigns. This model of rethinking the resilience of corrupt practices with the special focus on anti-corruption rhetoric can be applied to other countries where corruption serves as a pivot of the social and economic system, as it does in Russia.","[{""name"": ""Elena Pavlova"", ""affiliation"": [""St. Petersburg State University and University of Tartu, Estonia""]}]","[""10.1080/09668136.2019.1577359"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12079"", ""10.1111/gove.12232"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12032"", ""10.1177/0967010614555943"", ""10.4324/9781315773810"", ""10.1177/2041905818764704"", ""10.1177/0967010614557884"", ""10.1007/s12116-014-9155-1"", ""10.1080/09668136.2014.1001577"", ""10.1146/annurev.es.04.110173.000245"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12080"", ""10.1080/21693293.2013.765741"", ""10.1080/10758216.2002.11655993"", ""10.1080/13510347.2015.1071797"", ""10.1111/ehr.12666"", ""10.1080/09692291003791448"", ""10.1080/10758216.2017.1363655"", ""10.1080/09668136.2015.1120276"", ""10.5699/slaveasteurorev2.95.1.0001"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2014.931683"", ""10.1215/08992363-13-2-191"", ""10.1016/S0176-2680(02)00078-2"", ""10.1080/15705854.2014.965899"", ""10.1111/gove.12172"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01604.x"", ""10.2753/PPC1075-8216600202"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12033"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139175098"", ""10.1007/s10611-013-9506-2"", ""10.1080/03906700500038678"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3143406"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(99)00092-4"", ""10.1080/21599165.2014.990628"", ""10.1596/978-0-8213-9475-5""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It argues that while the entire near-abroad, and, in particular, Ukraine have been important in terms of Russia’s post-imperial ontological security seeking strategies, Belarus occupies a unique position with respect to Russia’s securitized identity because of its perfectly marginal or liminal status. This has to do with the fact that, in the Russian geopolitical gaze, Belarus has remained almost unseparated from the Russian Self. Furthermore, the 2020 protests challenged this status but did not entirely eliminate it, leading to a restructuration of Belarus’ liminality.","[{""name"": ""Aliaksei Kazharski"", ""affiliation"": [""Charles University, Czech Republic; Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia""]}, {""name"": ""Monika Kubová"", ""affiliation"": [""Central European University, Austria""]}]","[""10.1080/09668136.2018.1546829"", ""10.1177/1354066114557569"", ""10.1177/03058298070350031501"", ""10.1086/448325"", ""10.1177/0010836716653161"", ""10.4324/9781003131588"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0083-3"", ""10.1177/2336825X20984334"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2014.10.006"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2006.00023.x"", ""10.1080/13569775.2016.1201314"", ""10.1017/S026021050500687X"", ""10.1177/1354066198004002004"", ""10.7829/j.ctvh8r0nq"", ""10.1080/10758216.2019.1591925"", ""10.1080/10758216.2015.1057077"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2021.102377"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00396.x"", ""10.1177/0010836716653162"", ""10.1080/23745118.2016.1171275"", ""10.1177/2336825X20984337"", ""10.1177/0010836720911391"", ""10.1111/tran.12156"", ""10.1177/2336825X20984336"", ""10.30950/jcer.v9i2.506"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000829"", ""10.4324/9780203998014"", ""10.1177/1354066106067346"", ""10.1080/09662839.2018.1497985"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91965-2_8"", ""10.1057/jird.2008.7"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000817"", ""10.5771/9783845241968-73"", ""10.1177/2336825X1602400106"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000830"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004174481.i-239"", ""10.31171/vlast.v27i1.6236"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000842"", ""10.1080/09662839.2018.1497980"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190253301.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Erdem narrativizes the story of an odd traveller dervish named Kosmos, who has supernatural abilities and an expanded capability of communication—one that displays liminal features between human and animal. Through his distinctive editing technique, particularly by juxtaposing human and animal faces, the director further deconstructs the conceptual boundaries between humanity and animality, revealing the inherent connectedness of the two. Hence, this article discloses the consistency between the narrative and the form of Kosmos through a close reading based upon the notion of becoming-animal and its conceptual constituents.","[{""name"": ""Suphi Keskin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Burcu Baykan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Cultural Studies', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

The key question addressed is how to ensure that the inclusion of films and film theory by resident Africans can be made integral to the re-envisioning of the whole field. In answering this question, the overview examines the journal’s initial objectives and how they have been met. Editorial board members and guest editors were canvassed for their impressions, and a numerical analysis of author locations is plotted. The findings reveal a significant African presence now in studies of African films and in the composition of the journal’s authorship and editorial boards. The geographical spread of national and regional studies across the entire continent, sometimes in translation, from Arabic northern Africa to multilingual southern Africa is a key feature of the journal’s success. The conclusions reached are that the journal has successfully integrated African-based scholarship onto the world’s stage, has enabled the study of African film to link from its previous African studies’ epistemological location to now also be considered as film studies per se and new electronic distribution facilities have catalysed post-theory approaches that transcend the Cold War binaries of ‘Third Cinema’, national cinema’, ‘national culture’ and other twentieth-century categories.","[{""name"": ""Keyan G.

Details of a series of successful evidence-based theatrical interventions are provided along with the identification of areas in which our work directly overlaps drama therapy research. The methods involved in this endeavour include protocol analysis, behavioural testing and pre- and post-intervention data comparison. Most recently, these results have been verified by neuroscientists using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It is hoped that drama therapists will find elements of this program that will be applicable to their work with older adults.","[{""name"": ""Tony Noice"", ""affiliation"": [""Elmhurst University""]}, {""name"": ""Helga Noice"", ""affiliation"": [""Elmhurst University""]}]","[""10.1016/j.tics.2011.12.010"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(199603)52:2<191::AID-JCLP10>3.0.CO;2-F"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2008.06.004"", ""10.1207/s15516709cog1503_4"", ""10.1002/acp.2350060506"", ""10.1080/741940662"", ""10.1080/096582199387977"", ""10.1080/13825580802233400"", ""10.1080/0361073X.2013.808116"", ""10.1080/09658210050156813"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-0720(199908)13:4<315::AID-ACP581>3.0.CO;2-M"", ""10.1177/0898264304265819"", ""10.1002/acp.785"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.69.4.719"", ""10.1111/1467-8721.01236"", ""10.1386/dtr_00058_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Medicine', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Rehabilitation', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.72), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7194)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

Hickson’s play is formally influenced by the disrupted-time plays of Caryl Churchill. The present article, however, makes the case for another playwriting influence: that of George Bernard Shaw, whose discussion plays Oil comes to resemble in its third and fourth parts. Adopting the language Shaw uses in his critical study The Quintessence of Ibsenism, the article argues that Oil stages, in its dramaturgy, a dialectical struggle between the Shavian and Churchillian traditions. Viewed in this light, Hickson’s next play, The Writer, can be read as a synthesis of Oil’s formal experimentation and the critical reaction to it.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Poore"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CCOL9780521493222"", ""10.1080/10486801.2016.1216407"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-02131-1"", ""10.3998/mpub.5169198"", ""10.1057/9780230245211"", ""10.5040/9781472588500"", ""10.5040/9781784603953.00000002"", ""10.5040/9781784605049.00000002"", ""10.1057/9781137432339"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521562376.008"", ""10.1057/9781137010131_2"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226081014.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Medicine']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

We designed two experiments and interpreted their results using the Scene Perception and Event Comprehension Theory (SPECT). Across both experiments, viewers watched the scene, we manipulated their knowledge of the bomb, and they made a predictive inference just before the bomb would explode. Experiment 1 found that the likelihood of predicting the explosion decreased when the soundtrack was absent. Experiment 2 showed that individual differences in working memory accounted for variability in generating the prediction when the soundtrack was absent. We explore the implications for filmmaking in general.","[{""name"": ""John P. Hutson"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgia State University, USA jhutson@gsu.edu""]}, {""name"": ""Joseph P.

Malgré les pénuries et les mesures de rationnement ayant limité les voyages et déplacements à des fins récréatives de part et d’autre de la frontière canado-américaine, l’idée selon laquelle les campagnes de tourisme au Canada avaient cessé au cours de cette période est erronée. Les dollars des touristes américains étaient nécessaires pour soutenir l’effort de guerre, tandis que la réalisation de films personnels renforçait le discours entourant le bon voisinage et la coopération en temps de guerre. En particulier, l’Office national du film du Canada (ONF) adopta des approches novatrices et rentables pour appuyer le tourisme par l’entremise du cinéma en encourageant la réalisation de films de voyage personnels, comme en témoignent le concours Come to Canada de 1942 et le soutien à la carrière du couple de cinéastes Budge et Judith Crawley.","[{""name"": ""Dominique Brégent-Heald"", ""affiliation"": [""Dominique Brégent-Heald – Department of History, Memorial University, St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada""]}]","[""10.1515/9780773576698"", ""10.4324/9781003057277-13"", ""10.1515/9780887553516"", ""10.3138/cjfs.9.1.30"", ""10.1515/9780773596757-007"", ""10.1080/02614367.2013.798346"", ""10.2979/FIL.2003.15.2.238"", ""10.1515/9783110290691.115"", ""10.1093/whq/38.1.47"", ""10.1080/1755182X.2011.598572""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.3366/jbctv.2022.0615,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,Women Writers and Writing Women into Histories of Play for Today,"This article emerges from a research project which explores the contribution women writers have made to Play for Today. The project seeks to use the flagship series as a case study, to highlight the significance of the single play in the histories of women’s work in television drama, to identify the attendant gender politics of television production which have contributed to the high levels of inequality therein and to critically analyse women’s creative contributions to the television play. There has been very little sustained research of these issues, to a great extent because of the association of the single play with masculinity. This sphere of drama production has, as this flagship series illustrates, been male-dominated: only 13 per cent of the Play for Today series were written by women, only 23 per cent were produced by women and only 4 per cent were directed by women. The critical neglect of women’s contributions to the single play has largely been attributed to the male-dominance of the industry and the attendant invisibility of women in archives ( Moseley and Wheatley 2008 ) and television drama histories ( Caughie 2000 ; Cooke 2003 , 2015 ). The aim of this article is to use Play for Today as a case study to cast new light on the contributions women have made to the single play, and concomitantly, the significance of Play for Today and the single play in historiographies of women writers and British television drama.","[{""name"": ""Vicky Ball"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198742197.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-1-84457-896-2"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-47736-1"", ""10.5040/9781474290661.ch-014"", ""10.1093/screen/38.3.247"", ""10.1177/016344399021003006"", ""10.1353/cj.0.0018"", ""10.1093/screen/16.3.6"", ""10.1093/screen/31.4.408"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-05478-4"", ""10.3366/JBCTV.2004.1.2.197""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.3366/jbctv.2021.0591,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Women Documentary Film-makers and the British Housing Movement, 1930-45","This article examines the role women played, as film-makers and participants, in the development of the documentary genre from 1930 into the wartime period. In the 1930s and 1940s, the topics of slum clearance and town planning were a preoccupation of British documentary and non-fiction cinema. This article therefore first focuses on the little-known propaganda films generated by housing charities in the 1930s. After an examination of the use of films in the campaigns for better housing between the wars, it concentrates on three films which are linked by the inclusion of filmed interviews with the poorly housed. The study starts with a re-evaluation of Housing Problems (1935) and Kensal House (1937), widely regarded as the first of the genre, placing them in the context of the housing movement. It then gives an overview of the housing issue and female documentary-making during the Second World War, as background to a case study of film-maker Kay Mander, concentrating on her end-of-war manifesto Homes for the People (1945), which saw a further development of the interview technique and presented the women's perspective in a feminist manner. This article shows that women were not only instrumental in the development of the housing documentary but that the films they made promoted a female-orientated and progressive view of housing provision and town planning for working-class people. It was a passion for social change and a growing belief in the democratisation of the image of the poorly housed that determined changes in treatment in the films of the documentary film movement.","[{""name"": ""Toby Haggith"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5040/9781474290661.ch-004"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2021.0592"", ""10.1002/9780470712948.ch19"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198123699.001.0001"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2021.0590""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Current theories have broadened the concept of entertainment beyond amusement (hedonic motives) to include experiences of meaning, value, and self-development (eudaimonic motives). With a between-subjects design, we examined the role of reviewers’ ratings (medium rating vs. high rating), comments (hedonic vs. eudaimonic) and participants’ gratification styles on their interest in watching a movie. Results showed that participants (N = 383) reported a higher preference for the high rating movie. Results also revealed a match between comment type and individual gratification style, with participants with hedonic motives reporting more interest for the movie with hedonic comments, and those reporting eudaimonic motives for the movie with eudaimonic comments.","[{""name"": ""Nuno Piçarra"", ""affiliation"": [""Postdoctoral Researcher, ISCTE-University Institute, Lisbon, Portugal

Yet digital-audio performance walks also raise questions about performance and voyeurism, and the disconnection of private headphone experience, alongside issues of agency, detachment and appropriation. This article addresses key issues associated with digital-audio performance walks, using two case studies of performance walks (from Israel and Ireland), that aim to communicate politically charged and painful histories, which are at once ‘now’ and ‘then’, ‘here’ and ‘there’. The article considers some of the risks in digital-audio performance walks: dark tourism, privatization and empathic quietism. Finally, the article assesses what creative strategies are available to creators – and audiences – to make collaborative performance walks that galvanize spectators to become active witnesses.","[{""name"": ""EMILIE PINE"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""MAEVE CASSERLY"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""TOM LANE"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv16759tr"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316550403.003"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-36467-7"", ""10.1007/s00779-012-0624-0"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-58588-2_33"", ""10.1016/0160-7383(95)00062-3"", ""10.1057/9781137476890"", ""10.1215/01610775-31-3-119"", ""10.1353/book.20656"", ""10.1016/j.annals.2005.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.annals.2008.02.003"", ""10.1080/14725861003606894"", ""10.1007/s10708-015-9645-3"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226713465.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41510-9"", ""10.1177/1461444816663480"", ""10.1177/016344370302500105"", ""10.1080/1352725042000299063"", ""10.1177/13678779030063004"", ""10.1086/668053"", ""10.1057/9781137027290"", ""10.1353/tj.2011.0048"", ""10.4324/9781315640754"", ""10.1080/13528165.2003.10871912"", ""10.1057/9781137010742"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511675850.013"", ""10.4324/9781315670751"", ""10.1353/sof.0.0290"", ""10.3366/iur.2017.0260"", ""10.1177/1468797615588427""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Psychology']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

It has become an important link in the chain of actualizing the western as a genre in its variations against the background of the current social and cultural content. Initially a remake of the 1973 film of the same name directed by Michael Crichton, the series soon evolved: its second season has become a form of comprehension for both the basis of the western poetics in its relation to science fiction and the burning issues of the 21st century. “The rise of the machines” is interpreted here as a revolt against God, as overcoming the total scenarios of normative poetics and also as a visualization of Donna Haraway’s cyberfeminism ideas. The meta-western part of the Westworld plot unfolds from the 1970s and 1980s to the “revolutionary” aesthetics of the 60s and reveals its ambition to play around with the revisionist scripts of the spaghetti western, especially its most radical part — the zapata western. Trying on their revolutionary logic, the characters and creators of the series try to find their way out of the maze of unsolvable questions about the oncoming future and formulate new ethical dominants for a contemporary viewer. Such a logic supposes existence not in the world of a classical western — with the final triumph of justice, but in the world of a total revisionism of the late 1960s western. It is manifested in the integral poetics of the second season. Androids are creatures with a new worldview and perception of a different world order. They travel through different areas and levels of the historical park, collect key moments of history and stylistic features of a western as the central epic genre of cinema aesthetics. The first two seasons of the Westworld are as much an anthem to the cinema, the main art of the 20th century, as Quentin Tarantino’s westerns created at the same time. They demonstrate that in the world of contemporary values the cinema epic is the starting point of history, the beginning and the source of a person’s epic worldview. As a result, the western appears in the series as a key epic form underlying the mythological mind of a contemporary viewer. The meta-western nature also reflects the direction towards the total westernization of cinema aesthetics and, at the same time, an attempt to understand the reasons which led this approach to the crisis, projected onto the social contradictions of our time. The ironic laws of the spaghetti western, using the elements of Christianization and surrealism in the interpretation of the genre’s canonical schemes, make it possible to expand the range of the tasks set by the authors far beyond the borders of one-nation specifics.","[{""name"": ""ARTEM N.

In particular, I examine Gallese and Guerra’s arguments concerning the role of camera movement in prompting immersive, embodied simulation, as well as critiques of these arguments from David Bordwell and Malcolm Turvey. I focus on the special, irreducible role of critical analysis in these arguments. Detailed analysis of film form and style plays an essential role, I argue, in demonstrating the plausibility (or otherwise) of the thesis advanced by Gallese and Guerra.

10.1386/jams_00024_1,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN MEDIA STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0503 Journalism and Communication; 0303 Sociology,Translating the global climate change challenge into action as reflected in Uganda's media,"Climate change is a global risk that has affected all countries, which requires both global and national action. From the domain of scientists, who initially dominated climate debates, climate change has now become a public issue, with politicians increasingly influencing decisions on climate action, thus climate change becoming a highly politicized media topic. Given that media focus on key issues in society, this article examines the positioning of climate change in Uganda’s media as a means of gauging the level of political commitment to translate this global challenge into climate action. Premised within the issue-attention conceptual framework and based on the findings from the analysis of print media coverage in Uganda of the COP21 global summit, the article shows that climate change is not just a local national issue but is inexplicably linked to global frameworks, where voices and actors from the North not only dominate the global climate discourse but also transcend to the national level as reflected in the coverage, with most of the climate news being from foreign sources and foreign political leaders. Journalists are urged to pre-empt the local politicians to be active participants, not passive listeners in the global climate debates, such that climate issues become high on Uganda’s political communication agenda.","[{""name"": ""Goretti Nassanga"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000406200548 Makerere University""]}]","[""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228620.013.356"", ""10.4314/jdcs.v4i1.3"", ""10.4000/cea.1692"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228620.013.353"", ""10.17645/mac.v3i1.253"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.07.020"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228620.013.407"", ""10.1386/jams_00024_1""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The scholarship has mostly tended to focus on the content and political economy of indigenous language newspapers. The scholarship also suggests that much needs to be done in inculcating indigenous languages and indigenous language journalism in journalism education. Grounded in decoloniality, this article explores journalism training practices in selected institutions of higher learning in Zimbabwe. The intention is to unravel the absence or existence of training for indigenous journalism and perceptions of lecturers and attitudes of students towards indigenous language media and journalism. The article also seeks to establish whether there are any attempts to de-westernize journalism, media and communication studies. Methodologically, in-depth interviews were used to gather data from lecturers and students of journalism and media studies at colleges and universities in Zimbabwe. Findings show that the colleges surveyed do not offer any indigenous media journalism-specific modules or subjects. The lecturers, who include programme designers in some cases, have a low regard for indigenous language media. This, the article concludes, will have a knock-on effect on journalism students’ and journalists’ misgivings towards a career in indigenous language media.","[{""name"": ""Albert Chibuwe"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000097692525 North West University""]}, {""name"": ""Abioudun Salawu"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000097692525 North West University""]}]","[""10.12816/0019083"", ""10.1086/jar.53.2.3631274"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-62057-2_2"", ""10.1177/0163443704041176"", ""10.1353/ncr.2003.0057"", ""10.1080/10228195.2018.1441321"", ""10.1080/02572117.2018.1518036"", ""10.1080/14725843.2018.1473147"", ""10.1080/10228195.2018.1541925"", ""10.1080/10382040608668533"", ""10.1080/03056244.2014.988695"", ""10.1111/comt.12043"", ""10.1386/jams_00016_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.3366/film.2021.0179,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,"Thinking, Feeling and Experiencing the ""Empty Shot"" in Cinema","This article introduces the unique Asian film technique of the “empty shot” ( kong jingtou 空镜头) from the perspective of Chinese philosophical thought and aesthetics. In Chinese cinema, the “empty shot” is understood as a shot comprised of nonhuman subjects, distinct from both the establishing shot and the cutaway. Perhaps due to the lack of understanding of its philosophical grounding, the “empty shot” has not received much attention in Anglophone film studies, and has been criticized as an overgeneralised concept. This article first relates the “empty shot” to the more widely accepted “pillow shot” in Anglophone studies of Japanese cinema. This article aims to make visible a non-anthropocentric worldview conveyed through the “empty shot”, and to make space for the potentialities of this film device, which may also be found in non-Chinese cinemas. It explains the “empty shot”’s central features: firstly, its visible scenes are imbued with invisible emotion, leaving space for the audience to feel what the characters are feeling. Second, it facilitates the generation of qi or “air” in a film, indicating the circulation of qi in a process of dynamic transformation between “actual” and “virtual”. Thirdly, the “empty shot” communicates with the audience, allowing them to more fully experience natural scenery and to encounter other beings while suspending everyday experiences, existing biases, and the separation between self and other.","[{""name"": ""Siying Duan"", ""affiliation"": [""Shanghai University""]}]","[""10.5040/9781788318914"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1dnnb9p"", ""10.3366/film.2016.0016"", ""10.1525/9780520353046"", ""10.1386/ac.13.2.54_1"", ""10.1002/9781444355994.ch14"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-55309-6_5"", ""10.1057/9780230339507_4"", ""10.1002/9781444355994.ch1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Claudia Llosa, Peru/Spain/Argentina/US, 2011), which stars the transgender activist Belissa Andía. “Loxoro” is the name of a language used by travesti communities to survive in Lima, Peru. The main plot of the film centers on the bond between a travesti mother and her missing travesti daughter. That is why in Loxoro, travesti tears abound. This article raises the following questions: If Loxoro is a language for abandoned and wounded lovers in contexts of dispossession and violence, can travesti tears play a transformative role? What history of travesti tears does Loxoro offer? What forms of travesti loss and kinship imagine the film as deserving to mobilize tears? Can travesti tears foretell transfeminist futures to come?","[{""name"": ""Giancarlo Cornejo"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

Based on recent fieldwork, this essay gives attention to the ways in which female fans project themselves in three common spaces: in dark theatre auditoriums, online fan forums and feminist protests. In each of the three spaces, female musical fans nurture and enact their own version of feminism. I employ the discourse of ‘voyeurism’ and ‘half-visibility’ to understand how young South Korean women navigate patriarchal capitalist society. I ultimately argue that today’s South Korean musicals empower young South Korean women by providing safe spaces for feminism.","[{""name"": ""Jiyoon Jung"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107406917 University of California, Santa Cruz""]}]","[""10.1386/smt.10.3.343_1"", ""10.1111/jpcu.12669"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5931.2012.00927.x"", ""10.1093/screen/16.3.6"", ""10.1080/14682761.2014.899746"", ""10.1057/9781137478818_3"", ""10.1386/smt_00017_1""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"
10.1386/ac_00055_1,ASIAN CINEMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,The making of the citizenspectator in postmillennial Hong Kong: Authorial and spectatorial engagement with independent documentary films,"Established by several independent filmmakers in Hong Kong in 1997, Ying E Chi (YEC) has facilitated the production and the distribution of Hong Kong independent films by means of VCD/DVD releases, video streaming, film festivals and community screenings. The non-profit body has played a key role in aiding local independent filmmakers’ projects, seeking film distribution opportunities locally and transnationally and building community networks in its home city. As the organizer of the Hong Kong Independent Film Festival since 2008, YEC has demonstrated its fluid translocal positioning by not just promoting the works of local filmmakers, but also introducing worldwide independent cinema to Hong Kong audiences. In retrospect, the development of YEC has reflected the transforming cultural landscape of Hong Kong to different degrees. From cinephiles and academics to the public, the audiences YEC has developed over the years indicates an ever-changing spectatorship in the making, bespeaking the various responses to the social environment under which these films were made, shown and watched. This article will use YEC as a case study to explore the mutual impacts between documentary films and their spectatorship which have shaped independent filmmakers’ production and distribution strategies continuously in postmillennial Hong Kong, particularly in the wake of the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the 2019 Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement. The article will draw on interviews with local independent filmmakers, in order to understand how industry practices and dynamics have responded to identification, social events and audience behaviours over time. In this regard, spectatorship is understood as not just an embodied experience of film viewing, but also a series of affinities between the filmmaker, the audience and the film work. As a whole, the article will probe how the idea of citizen-spectator has evolved and has become inscribed in spectatorial engagement with independent documentary films, which has oscillated between audiences’ approval and authorities’ disapproval in postmillennial Hong Kong.","[{""name"": ""Helena Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122889830 University of British Columbia, Vancouver""]}]","[""10.1080/03068374.2021.1878734"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1783791"", ""10.2307/778886"", ""10.1080/1369801X.2018.1460220"", ""10.1386/ac_00055_1""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Therefore, building on expert interviews with people working in the remake industries of the Low Countries, this article places the production aspect of the film remake process central. The findings suggest that the manner in which these cultural mediators describe and evaluate the film remake mirrors popular discourses and seems to affect the production process of film remakes themselves. It was found that the phenomenon is generally seen as the result of a lack of originality, authenticity and is, moreover, highly commercially driven. These aspects were found to sometimes function as a license for initiating remake projects. However, next to the financial benefits, other personal and creative rationales were advanced. Additionally, the element of localization was deemed as one of the most essential tactics in the creative process. Finally, distributors appear to be crucial figures in the emergence of film remakes in small geo-linguistic film markets.","[{""name"": ""Eduard Cuelenaere"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Communication Sciences, Ghent University"", ""Department of Literature, University of Antwerp""]}]","[""10.5040/9781838710491"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-62806-6"", ""10.1515/9781474452052-017"", ""10.5117/IVN2013.1.CALU"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2018.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2013.11.004"", ""10.1525/9780520310216-003"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-97157-5_1"", ""10.1111/j.1753-9137.2009.01037.x"", ""10.14361/transcript.9783839428948"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474407236.003.0014"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748625369.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.10424-6"", ""10.2307/j.ctv10crd8x.11"", ""10.7560/309001"", ""10.1515/commun-2019-2058"", ""10.1353/crt.2004.0001"", ""10.1515/commun-2019-2062"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199296507.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52854-0_11"", ""10.1080/17411548.2018.1471030"", ""10.4000/books.editionscnrs.683"", ""10.4324/9780203807125"", ""10.1515/9780748677474"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474407236.003.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16896-4"", ""10.7560/790902""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

The first one has to do with film theory and history: the new attention, inspired by cognitive neuroscience, to the viewer’s brain-body, the sensorimotor basis of film cognition, and the forms of embodied simulation elicited by the cinematic experience has stimulated a profound rethinking of a relevant part of the theoretical discourse on cinema, from the very beginning of the twentieth century to the most recent reflections within cognitive film studies and the phenomenology of film. The second line has to do with the intersubjective relationship between the movie—its style, rhythm, characters, and narrative—and the viewer, and it is characterized by an empirical approach that yields very interesting results, useful for rethinking and problematizing our ideas about editing, camera movements, and film reception.

Se concluye que su promoción engloba contenidos y acciones no convencionales de gran originalidad y que contribuyen al universo narrativo de laspelículas y, por tanto, de la propia marca Pixar; y que estos contenidos y acciones, en su diversidad, tienen el nexo común de intentar traer la ficción de las pantallas a una esfera real o incluso física.&lt;/p&gt;","[{""name"": ""David Selva-Ruiz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7764/cdi.39.752"", ""10.1509/jmr.14.0099"", ""10.4324/9781138916470"", ""10.4324/9780080473437"", ""10.4324/9780080942919"", ""10.1145/37402.37407"", ""10.12795/Ambitos.2004.i11-12.26"", ""10.1109/MC.2009.228""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Millennial femininity and entrepreneurial selfhood in Girlboss and The Girlfriend Experience,"The cultural politics of The Girlfriend Experience (2016–present) and Girlboss (2017) are symptomatic of intersecting discourses surrounding millennial femininity and neo-liberal enterprise culture. Featuring aggressively individualistic, White, twenty-something female protagonists, both shows interrogate the slender ideological crevice that separates economic libertarianism from social pathology. Girlboss and The Girlfriend Experience critically explore the ontological dissonance experienced by a millennial cohort schooled exclusively in the mythologies of a stubbornly resilient neo-liberal culture. As such, these young women are best understood as ideological avatars that expose the entropic conjunction of gendered individualism and entrepreneurial selfhood in a ‘post’-recessionary United States.","[{""name"": ""Martin Fradley"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121073784 University of Brighton""]}]","[""10.1080/14680777.2018.1546206"", ""10.1177/1367549417733003"", ""10.1057/9780230294523_1"", ""10.1017/S0021875815001723"", ""10.1111/soc4.12033"", ""10.1386/jptv_00082_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

More specifically, Baldi explains why the CSC was popular in the 1930s and 1940s among students from the Axis nations in pre-war Europe, mentions the fascination of world artists with Italian neorealism, attributes international interest of the CSC to the artistic reputation of the film professionals who taught at the CSC and expresses his interpretation of the reasons for the large numbers of students from Greece, the Arab nations, Latin America and the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. Since its foundation, the CSC has granted diplomas at the end of the two- or three-year cycle of studies, but starting in the 2021–24 academic cycle, it will grant university degrees.

The majority of that literature approaches the show critically to address issues relating to the representation of race, gender, consumerism, identity and relationships within the format of a competition. Other research on the show ruminates about its relationship to its ‘savvy’ viewers who know reality television is not truly real and yet paradoxically continue to be highly invested in the outcome of its shows. Yet other literature probes for the gratifications embedded in the viewing process and the perceptions of dating that the show cultivates in its viewers. The longevity of The Bachelor can be attributed to the sense of allegiance the viewers feel to the show. To that end, this study is an inquiry into perceptions of the show by its viewers. Using the Q sort methodology, this empirical study reveals insights into its appeal by providing clearly grouped audiences and their particular uses for the show. It also addresses the interface between reality television, social media and the mediated representation of romantic relationships.","[{""name"": ""Scott Haden Church"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369115 Brigham Young University""]}, {""name"": ""Tom Robinson"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369115 Brigham Young University""]}, {""name"": ""Clark Callahan"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369115 Brigham Young University""]}, {""name"": ""Katherine Klotzer Barboza"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369115 Brigham Young University""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel Montez"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369115 Brigham Young University""]}]","[""10.1177/1367549406063162"", ""10.1080/01463373.2012.641830"", ""10.1080/08838150903102659"", ""10.1080/15295030903583572"", ""10.1080/07393180600570733"", ""10.1080/15295030802327774"", ""10.1080/15205436.2011.583545"", ""10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.11.067"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00354.x"", ""10.1080/01463371003773358"", ""10.1080/00224499909551995"", ""10.1080/08838150903310468"", ""10.1207/s15506878jobem5002_5"", ""10.1080/01463370802026828"", ""10.1080/08838150701307111"", ""10.1207/S1532785XMEP0504_01"", ""10.1207/s1532785xmep0804_5"", ""10.1080/08838150701307152"", ""10.1080/15405702.2010.514177"", ""10.1207/s1532785xmep0604_3"", ""10.1037/ppm0000005"", ""10.1080/10714420701350403"", ""10.1086/432238"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1984.tb02174.x"", ""10.1080/10410236.2013.836733"", ""10.1037/ppm0000103"", ""10.1080/08838151.2011.620663"", ""10.1080/15213269.2013.832627"", ""10.1386/jptv_00009_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Gender Studies', 'Communication']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Such aspects as the lack of censorship, freedom from severe restrictions on story genres and heroes’ types have a significant impact on the dramaturgy of native web series. Those are the things that determine the attractiveness of this new format for experienced Russian authors moving to the internet from related fields: cinema and television. The results of the study show that Russian dramatists and directors rely on foreign experience of creating web series, but at the same time they try to modify certain features of this format and sometimes manage to find their own unique solutions.","[{""name"": ""Artem Prokhorov"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000405782005 HSE University""]}]","[""10.1386/ajpc.8.1.71_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-21744-0_14"", ""10.1177/1329878X17708842"", ""10.1386/josc_00046_1""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Information Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article considers whether the concept of bureaucratic-authoritarianism is really applicable in the case of Russia. Lilia Shevtsova was the first to tentatively state that Russia is a case of bureaucratic-authoritarianism. However, to provide more assured acceptance or rejection of the concept, this article returns to the paradigm’s roots. The concept of bureaucratic-authoritarianism was developed by Guillermo O’Donnell and thus the characteristics he outlined are applied to the case of Russia in the Putin era.

10.1215/02705346-9349315,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Rewitched: Retextuality and the Queering of Bewitched,"Abstract At the same time the 1960s sitcom Bewitched aired in reruns next to drag queens on LOGOtv, a cable channel targeted to LGBTQ viewers, it also aired on the former National Christian Network channel (FamilyNet) immediately preceding a lineup of church programs featuring far-right, anti-gay hosts. Bewitched's ability to appeal to these very different channels’ brands and audiences underscores a textual vigor and sustainability for success in syndication that even the best so-called quality shows today lack. While some may deride a study of syndication (and reruns especially) as irrelevant and passé, syndicated programs are neither of those things if their continued popularity assures our familiarity with them. As a text, Bewitched is already supple enough to motivate two politically opposing media brands to pick it up, but the context of each of these channels’ flow, including commercials, station IDs, and edits to content, can make the experience of watching the same episode of any show on different channels a wholly different textual experience. This article returns to foundational theories of TV flow and intertextuality to propose retextuality as a theoretical and methodological intervention in studies of television. It argues that in syndication, the production labor of syndicators, executives, programmers, and marketing departments effectively retextualizes shows like Bewitched, offering scholars opportunities for new textual analyses and new insight into the marginalized and queer audiences syndicated programming often serves.","[{""name"": ""Taylor Cole Miller"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1093/adaptation/apab006,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Revising The Scarlet Letter: Race and Motherhood in In the Blood and Little Fires Everywhere,"Abstract Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter has generated numerous adaptations. Its depiction of race has made it a problematic ‘master text’, however, especially since it was published in the same year as the US Fugitive Slave Act. This essay examines three recent adaptations across a variety of media that focus on the relationship between race and motherhood, revealing the ways in which Hester Prynne can be integrated into society as a single mother in ways that non-white mothers cannot. Suzan-Lori Parks’ 1998 play In the Blood stages ‘Hester, La Negrita’ as a homeless mother of five who cannot escape the ‘hand of fate’ of racial oppression. Celeste Ng’s 2017 novel Little Fires Everywhere reinvents Hester as a surrogate mother whose efforts on behalf of a birth mother in a trans-racial adoption dispute highlight how race differentially impacts maternal rights. The 2020 Hulu television adaptation of Ng’s novel casts the Hester and Pearl figures, along with an artist named Hawthorne, as black women whose activism forces the Richardson family to acknowledge their white privilege. Together, these adaptations examine how the ‘monstrous birth’ of slavery that Hawthorne only belatedly acknowledged has had a lingering afterlife in constructions of race and motherhood.","[{""name"": ""Susan S Williams"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, The Ohio State University, USA""]}]","[""10.1177/0027432119864261"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674726321"", ""10.2307/1567048"", ""10.1353/saf.2001.0008"", ""10.1080/09502369308582156"", ""10.36019/9780813553313"", ""10.1215/01610775-29-2-26"", ""10.1353/saf.2001.0007"", ""10.5325/nathhawtrevi.42.2.0001"", ""10.1017/9781316271537"", ""10.1353/cdr.0.0004"", ""10.1215/01610775-21-3-73"", ""10.2307/464747"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apr006""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Since the Swedish Film Institute launched a program for gender equality in 2013, redesigned in 2016 as the action plan 50/50 by 2020, Sweden has been held up as a model country and the Film Institute’s CEO Anna Serner has held several widely publicized seminars in Cannes and elsewhere. This article aims to contextualize the Swedish case, as influential curators, jury chairs, and festival directors around the globe have signed the 50/50 by 2020 campaign with no evidence of its primary goal of dividing production support evenly between men and women by 2020 being within reach. I show that the notion of Sweden as an egalitarian haven obscures remaining injustices, norms, and, not least, the equality program’s lack of intersectional analysis. Unraveling “the myth of gender equality” in Swedish film, this essay shows how this myth operates in the context of Swedish foreign policy and self-promotion in the neoliberal present. As much as the current mobilization for change is worth applauding, I argue that it is crucial to critically examine actual measures and push for redistributive results beyond symbolic commitment, individual recognition, and positive publicity.","[{""name"": ""Ingrid Ryberg"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Gender Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

Drawing upon the work of Gavin Bolton and key appraisal theorists, the aim of the article is to extend current understandings of how emotion is experienced within process drama, while also gaining new insights into the factors that impact its type and intensity. Using a framework that links emotion, connection and commitment, analysis of the data reveals that when individuals experience high levels of both commitment and connection, diverse emotions are generated. It also reveals that while these emotional responses are highly individual and generally independent of the strategies being employed, their intensity is associated with dramatic tension. The article suggests that an understanding of these findings is important for effective process drama structuring and facilitation.","[{""name"": ""Julie Dunn"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404375432 Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Penny Bundy"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404375432 Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Madonna Stinson"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404375432 Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia""]}]","[""10.1080/13569780308333"", ""10.1080/08824090902861523"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-132680-7.50007-7"", ""10.1177/1754073912468165"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195130072.003.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00548.x"", ""10.1037/a0014632"", ""10.1080/15213260701853161"", ""10.1080/1356978960010204"", ""10.1386/atr_00037_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"
10.1515/jcde-2020-0024,JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY DRAMA IN ENGLISH,1303 Drama Film and Television,Posthuman Dystopia: Animal Surrealism and Permanent Crisis in Contemporary British Theatre,"Abstract The paper situates current developments in British theatre within wider trends towards dystopia and (post-)apocalyptic writing. A central focus is on the role of posthuman elements in dystopian plays which are used to create a constant and pervasive, but mostly unspecific sense of crisis. Two recent works by female playwrights – Dawn King’s Foxfinder (2011) and Stef Smith’s Human Animals (2016) – are compared and related back to Caryl Churchill’s seminal Far Away (2000) to elucidate how the nonhuman comes to be perceived as a threat and how this leads to, and/or supports, a dystopian system and its violent measures. Moreover, both Foxfinder and Human Animals manage to combine absurdist elements that border on the surreal with more or less pronounced didactic implications for the audience, although these connections are realised in different ways by the two playwrights. In this manner, post-apocalyptic dystopian theatre of the early 21st century can become revolutionary rather than regressive.","[{""name"": ""Eckart Voigts"", ""affiliation"": [""TU Braunschweig Braunschweig Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Merle Tönnies"", ""affiliation"": [""University Paderborn Paderborn Germany""]}]","[""10.1080/03085140600844902"", ""10.1057/9781137330024"", ""10.5040/9781784602420.00000003"", ""10.1017/CCOL9780521886659.005"", ""10.1057/9780230582224"", ""10.1353/dss.2008.0072"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511486197"", ""10.4000/sillagescritiques.4798"", ""10.1515/jcde-2019-0006"", ""10.5040/9781784603779.00000002"", ""10.3402/jac.v1i0.3668"", ""10.1515/jcde-2017-0012"", ""10.37307/j.2366-2913.2018.05.04""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Hotel Pro Forma’s visual opera NeoArctic (2016) and Yggdrasil Dance’s dance meditation Siku Aapoq/ Melting Ice (2015) explore how to aesthetically shape the ecological impact on human existence. The article discusses the performances’ impact on potential responses to the climate crisis.&#x0D; In NeoArctic, human activities have caused “overflow feedback”: a constant flow of digital vistas of pollution, raging weather, temperature rises alternate with the planet’s eternal processes, while underscored by ambience and operatic electro-pop. The images are front-projected onto the stage backdrop to create a literal overflow of the steadfast choir-performers, in which they almost disappear or become ghostly shadows, implying their imminent demise or insignificance on a planetary scale.&#x0D; Siku Aapoq engages with Greenland’s melting icecap: two dancers, Norwegian and Inuit, interact with a fabric understood as the melting ice, while enveloped in evocative lights, the crackling of glaciers, Inuit chants, ambience, and jazz. The Norwegian and the Inuit take turns enacting the ice, suggesting the interconnectedness with nature of both cultures.&#x0D; Both performances seem to invite acceptance of inevitable disaster. Yet, human prevalence is implied in the stagings by convergence of past and future in the present, which suggests that the future is still undecided, and survival depends on an ability to respond to the materiality of the environment that we are already entangled in through a profound sense of beauty.&#x0D; Theoretically, the analyses mainly draw on agential realism (Karen Barad) in order to outline a “para-Anthropo(s)cene aesthetics” that may reach beyond the human and engage spectators in realizing their ethical entanglement and the call for climate action. Considering intentions and reception, and the dystopian nature of the performances, the responses to climate change that the aesthetics may instigate are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Kim Skjoldager-Nielsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daria Skjoldager-Nielsen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

And, at a time of heightened awareness about touch putting people at risk that could not have been a consideration at the time the shows were produced, Sex Education and Trigonometry use an educationally expansive narrative of sexualities in which an aesthetics of tactility is underpinned by new narrative forms shaped by consent and respect, to encourage viewers to welcome an equally expansive commonality.","[{""name"": ""So Mayer"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1093/adaptation/apz032,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Oh Hi There History: An Adaptation of Historical Research and an Exploration of Fidelity Discourse through Practice,"AbstractAdaptation studies theorists have debated the value and scope of fidelity criticism for decades, but the application of fidelity discourse from an adaptation practitioner perspective is vastly under-researched. Using a practice-based research strategy, this article describes how a consideration of fidelity discourse during the development of the web-series, Oh Hi There History, supported the development of the series as an adapted text and raised new questions about adaptation theory and practice. Oh Hi There History is an adaptation of the Founders and Survivors project’s research into Tasmanian convict history. This article considers the binary of in/fidelity in a practitioner context, analyses how fidelity taxonomies might be applied to the development of an adapted text, and explores the possibilities of applying through practice theoretical approaches to fidelity discourse around intertextuality and history-as-adaptation. By applying these theories in a new context, this article argues that practice-based research can provide new insight into fidelity discourse and new ways of understanding the role of fidelity in adaptation practice.","[{""name"": ""Lydia Nicholson"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tasmania""]}]","[""10.1080/13642529.2014.927207"", ""10.56021/9780801828065"", ""10.1353/nlh.2007.0038"", ""10.1016/j.hisfam.2010.08.002"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521849624.017"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521849624.003"", ""10.1177/1367877911402589"", ""10.5040/9781408167533"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apv011"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apx023"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-20516-5"", ""10.5040/9780755603695.ch-008"", ""10.5040/9780755604104.ch-011"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521849624.005"", ""10.1515/9780748646081-010"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511523809"", ""10.1080/1081602X.2015.1006654"", ""10.3167/9781571814104"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apy006"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apx028"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apx026"", ""10.1080/09523980902933532"", ""10.1057/9781137311139_7"", ""10.52086/001c.32504"", ""10.1007/BF02435632"", ""10.1080/17439884.2013.783594"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apx009""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

It can be expected that music teacher education programs, as part of higher education, would benefit from envisioning their shared future from the same starting point. This chapter presents the second-stage inquiry of “Co-creating visions for intercultural music teacher education in Finland and Israel,” an ongoing collaborative research project between the Sibelius Academy of the University of the Arts Helsinki and the Levinsky College of Education in Israel. The study is based on the constructionist pre-understanding that music teacher education programs ought to be developed by conversations and collective reflections, and that it is through these reflections that we narrate change. As an overall methodological framework, the study draws from Appreciative Inquiry (AI), emphasizing the positive as the basis from which to envision together what the future of intercultural music teacher education would look like. The data was collected through four workshop discussions, two at each site, totaling 24 participating teacher educators. The forward-looking themes of these second-stage discussions were developed from the groundwork of the first-stage focus group interview inquiry that mapped the present situation. This study suggests that there is an increasing need to create spaces where music teacher candidates and music teacher educators creatively face uncertainty rather than security, and where risk-taking can be encouraged and practiced safely. There is also a need to increase flexibility and openness, and to continue working more collaboratively within the institutions.","[{""name"": ""Laura Miettinen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Heidi Westerlund"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Claudia Gluschankof"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1048371313478946"", ""10.1177/1321103X08089891"", ""10.1023/A:1004159513741"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199356157.001.0001"", ""10.4135/9781446288160"", ""10.1002/casp.777"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8601.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1028315306287002"", ""10.4135/9781473921276"", ""10.1177/1057083713494011"", ""10.4324/9781315747279"", ""10.1177/0022487109353032"", ""10.1177/1321103X18757713"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2009.05.012"", ""10.1177/0022487116660152"", ""10.1177/0018726714561698"", ""10.1080/01419870701599465"", ""10.22176/act16.3.78""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Education']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

This study finds that Kenyan newspapers adopted a more critical and problem-centred narrative, as many of its news articles are organized around problems such as the ‘debt-trap diplomacy’, and the mistreatment of Africans in Guangzhou during the pandemic. Unlike Kenyan newspapers, Ethiopian newspapers adopted a more positive and favourable tone towards China. This article also captures the dynamics behind the production of China-related news during the pandemic, and discusses how the media environment, professional norms, journalistic habitus, the ‘rules of games’ (i.e. who counts as an important source) have fundamentally shaped the news production.","[{""name"": ""Hangwei Li"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404255983 SOAS, University of London""]}]","[""10.1386/jams.1.3.343/1"", ""10.1080/23792949.2019.1703556"", ""10.1177/1748048516656303"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2451.2010.01751.x"", ""10.1080/01292986.2020.1801781"", ""10.1080/01292980500261621"", ""10.1080/13696815.2016.1241704"", ""10.1177/1464884907083118"", ""10.1177/107769900508200407"", ""10.1080/17544750.2015.1078386"", ""10.1080/15205436.2016.1174268"", ""10.1177/030639688502700201"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2000.tb02843.x"", ""10.1080/02560054.2011.578879"", ""10.1080/23743670.2018.1473275"", ""10.1080/08838159909364474"", ""10.1080/105846001750322934"", ""10.1093/afraf/adx039"", ""10.1386/jams_00057_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

While acknowledging the obstacles she undoubtedly faced, it details aspects of her achievements and her visibility in the British film culture of the immediate post-war period. Craigie's politically driven documentaries and realist film practice accorded with prevailing discourses of ‘quality’ and she acquired the status of what would today be termed a media personality who worked across film, radio, television and print media. Considering Craigie as a figure embedded in the British film establishment, this article gives particular emphasis to her role in the British Film Academy (BFA), arguing that the significance of this practitioner-led organisation has yet to be fully recognised in British film history.

La réalisatrice propose un recadrage, selon un point de vue inuit, de la rhétorique dominante entourant la chasse aux phoques, pratique décriée violemment par des groupes de défense des droits des animaux. Plus qu’une simple réfutation de ces discours sudistes, ce film met de l’avant les connaissances inuites en lien avec le territoire et la gestion des ressources et remet en question les argumentaires libératoires soutenus par ces organismes, dont les raisonnements reconduisent des dynamiques coloniales plutôt que de les ébranler. Comme l’évoque son titre, le documentaire riposte à l’ire des protestataires anti-chasse aux phoques (dont la voix s’impose souvent au détriment des voix inuites, généralement tues), en créant un espace d’expression pour la colère inuite, présentée à la fois comme carburant et comme point de départ légitime et valide de la lutte contre les organismes en question. De façon centrale, le film met en scène des récits de chasse aux phoques s’appuyant sur une « agentivité sensorielle » inuite qui, aux yeux de Dylan Robinson, se manifeste sous la forme de « modes d’expression qui, à la fois, affirment une force culturelle et exercent une puissance affective auprès des personnes présentes ». Arnaquq-Baril propose ainsi des représentations de rires partagés, d’un froid ressenti, de sons joyeux de consommation communautaire de diverses parties du phoque, de même que des photos tirées de la campagne Twitter menée autour du mot-clic #sealfie ; cette campagne médiatique, ancrée dans une célébration humoristique et fière de la chasse inuite aux phoques, se veut en ce sens un contre-point au discours affectif simpliste et méprisant des organismes anti-chasse.

In this act of collegial sharing, intercultural conversation is used as an instrument for research. The documented effort to communicate respective culturally grounded perspectives to one another illuminates taken-for-granted norms and habits and expands respective understandings of cultural assumptions that currently underlie structures of religious segregation in Israeli music teacher education. Working to reimagine such structures, the authors question the possibility of inter-culturalism in the context of segregation. Tracing the constraints of cultural diversity further, considering policy and music teacher education, the authors re-imagine socio-religious segregation in Israeli music teacher education as an opportunity for culturally responsive teaching. The analysis and the envisioning are grounded in the experiences of the two authors as lecturers in two specialized segregated programs of music teacher education geared towards Arabic speaking populations and the Jewish Ultraorthodox community. Conclusions aspire towards cultural specificity within each community as a platform for future intercultural sharing that the authors believe can enrich Israeli society at large.","[{""name"": ""Amira Ehrlich"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Belal Badarne"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511845307"", ""10.2979/ISR.1997.2.2.40"", ""10.1177/0027432112442903"", ""10.1177/0022487109347320"", ""10.3200/AEPR.109.3.37-46"", ""10.4324/9781315747279"", ""10.2307/2578187"", ""10.2307/932653""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Education', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

It is the first internationally acclaimed documentary by a Chinese female director to centre upon investigating the activities of Ye Haiyan, a Chinese sex and women’s rights activist, as well as to address the politically sensitive topic of sexual assault in China.

I unpack the power dynamics in this documentary as well as the interplay between the filmmaker’s subjectivity and the female rights activist’s subjectivity.

Pressure building since the death of Parnell in 1891 would lead to Ireland’s independence from Britain and the establishment of the Irish free State in 1922, with Shaw’s Irish friends Horace Plunkett, Augusta Gregory, George Russell (“Æ”), and especially W.

Through these four as well as his Irish wife, Charlotte Shaw, Shaw became involved in both the affairs of the nation as well as in Irish drama, especially Dublin’s Abbey Theatre. Yeats and his work were particularly important for Shaw’s contributions to the Irish literary revival, in which, whether in satirical, comic, or tragic modes, his Irish plays comprehend Irish mythology, history, imagination, and religious salvation.","[{""name"": ""Peter Gahan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

This “hunt for reality,” as Razbezhkina terms the practice, usually results in deeply engaging observational documentaries that completely absorb the viewer into an unfamiliar reality.

10.1093/adaptation/apaa012,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Game of Thrones, Tourism, and the Ethics of Adaptation","Abstract This article examines ‘adaptation-induced tourism’, a form of media-induced tourism understood to be distinct from ‘screen tourism’ or ‘literary tourism’ and marked by tourist activity related to an adaptation from one media format to another. Such adaptation-induced tourism activates an existing fan base and as a result provides considerably more upside in terms of the potential long-tail impact of tourism, but also faces particularly acute challenges in terms of fidelity and potential negative fan reactions. Moreover, this article suggests an ethical dimension to adaptation. Examining Game of Thrones tourism in and around Belfast, Northern Ireland (UK), this research shows that the choice to adapt popular works through extensive location shooting invites significant increases in visitation, thereby bringing sustainability issues to the fore and forcing communities to ‘adapt’ to new realities. The changes that occur on the local level, while often positive in the short-term, may have deleterious impacts upon the physical and cultural ecosystem, particularly in the context of climate change and a larger trend in tourism towards ‘adapting’ to new geoatmospheric and political realities. The article suggests that stakeholders involved in location scouting, providing incentives to film and television producers, and the marketing of place might remain mindful of and proactive concerning unintended consequences to seemingly obvious production and development decisions, particularly where adaptations are concerned. Finally, the article suggests that adaptation-induced tourism spaces and their reproduction by visitors are further examples of adaptation that have the potential to induce further visitation, creating a productive circle with ambivalent outcomes.","[{""name"": ""Robert Moses Peaslee"", ""affiliation"": [""Texas Tech University""]}, {""name"": ""Rosalynn Vasquez"", ""affiliation"": [""Texas Tech University"", ""Texas Tech University""]}]","[""10.3727/154427207783948892"", ""10.1016/j.tourman.2014.09.023"", ""10.1080/14616689908721291"", ""10.1108/16605370780000309"", ""10.1016/j.tmp.2013.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.tourman.2012.02.008"", ""10.1080/14790530903522598"", ""10.1177/1367877908096003"", ""10.1016/S0160-7383(00)00062-1"", ""10.18573/jomec.194"", ""10.1177/1468797606071475"", ""10.1016/S0261-5177(98)00020-X"", ""10.1080/14790530903522606"", ""10.1016/0261-5177(95)00110-7"", ""10.1057/thr.2009.31"", ""10.1016/j.jdmm.2013.12.009"", ""10.1177/1356766706064619"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.1080/13683500.2013.774323"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9157-7"", ""10.4324/9781315168579"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apm005"", ""10.1016/j.tourman.2016.11.023"", ""10.1145/2931127.2931219"", ""10.1108/17554211111123032"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-56712-3"", ""10.20867/thm.21.1.7"", ""10.3727/109830408786177515"", ""10.1002/jtr.676"", ""10.1177/1468797611412063"", ""10.1108/IJCTHR-09-2013-0064"", ""10.1016/S0160-7383(98)00097-8"", ""10.1080/09669589608667263"", ""10.1177/1468797604053077"", ""10.1177/026327692009003001"", ""10.1016/j.tourman.2012.10.008"", ""10.1057/9780230584563"", ""10.1080/09669582.2010.536242"", ""10.18111/9789284402809""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Being neither children nor adults, teenagers inhabit a biologically and ideologically ambiguous position within society, a precarious collocation that has often been referred to as ‘liminal’. In her films, Rohrwacher enhances her characters’ inherent liminality by (dis-)placing them, both physically and metaphorically, at the margins of society. However, it is their spatial and social exclusion and their position of subordination to power that allows them to identify alternative behaviours that oppose the dominant ideology within their social environments. Making use of the notions of marginality and liminality, this article explores the implications of the director’s employment of adolescent characters to critique Italian mainstream society.","[{""name"": ""Silvia Angeli"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000090468598 University of Westminster""]}]","[""10.1080/02614340.2017.1332718"", ""10.1017/mit.2017.17"", ""10.1080/10509208.2017.1347866"", ""10.1179/026143412X13442661823539"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89381-5_1"", ""10.1386/jicms.5.3.305_1"", ""10.1525/FQ.2011.65.2.43"", ""10.1057/9781137030870_1"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-7061-4_1"", ""10.1386/jicms_00026_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article takes a closer look at this hardly examined but very important actor in German television. Based on expert interviews, it discusses how this profession is negotiated within the industry and how its role is changing in light of the broader transformation and transnationalization of the TV industry in Germany. Shifts in fictional content and its distribution have led to fundamental changes in the work of editors and their involvement in collaborative project networks. For example, the demand for ‘quality’ serials, ideally distributed in different countries, is accompanied by the adoption of writers’ room and showrunner models. Hence, the relationship between editor and screenwriter is transforming, too. The previous cooperation between editor and producer is also ripe for discussion, as signs point to a move away from 100 per cent financing by broadcasters, which was the rule in German television fiction for a long time. New financing models are negotiated in conjunction with online distribution, which fundamentally restructures the editor’s role. However, so far, linear broadcasting slots still form a central basis of editors’ work.","[{""name"": ""Florian Krauß"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122428751 University of Siegen""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-658-29319-2_11"", ""10.1177/1527476417708245"", ""10.1386/jmpr.5.2.89/0"", ""10.1386/josc.1.1.45/1"", ""10.1007/978-3-322-97024-4_14"", ""10.1080/08838151.2011.648686"", ""10.1057/9781137282187_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-97322-7_8"", ""10.1386/jptv_00017_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

Set out as a theorized reflection of praxis, I interrogate how the facilitator can draw from actors’ linguistic resources without perpetuating dominant and potentially damaging language ideologies, by which I refer to the socially shared beliefs about language that shape and are shaped by language use. I discuss the powerful language ideologies connected to so-called ‘standard’ English and constructed by dominant institutions to discover how they are reproduced in performance praxis. I also analyse performance examples engaging complex linguistic conditions related to both student and refugee groups in the United Kingdom and South Africa to discuss varied facilitation approaches in context. Through my reflection, I reveal the complexities and opportunities for the facilitator navigating the socio-culturally and politically fraught terrain of language.","[{""name"": ""Claire French"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000088091613 University of Warwick, UK""]}]","[""10.1016/S0271-5309(03)00012-0"", ""10.1080/13569780903072125"", ""10.1017/S004740450001037X"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2011.01207.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-092611-145828"", ""10.1146/annurev.anthro.30.1.19"", ""10.1525/aa.1966.68.4.02a00040"", ""10.1007/s10993-015-9372-0"", ""10.1525/ae.1989.16.2.02a00040"", ""10.1111/j.0883-2919.2004.00363.x"", ""10.2989/16073614.2018.1452876"", ""10.1080/1356978042000185902"", ""10.1080/13569783.2010.495272"", ""10.1080/13569783.2015.1065725"", ""10.1080/08929092.2006.10012585"", ""10.1080/10407413.2011.591274"", ""10.1075/jlp.6.1.01wod"", ""10.1386/atr_00045_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

The first leg of the study concluded that the interviewees were aware and knowledgeable about COVID-19, and the health impact it posed, but nearly half of them doubted its presence in Malawi. The second leg found that participants no longer doubted COVID-19’s presence in Malawi as some prominent people they knew in their locality had either died or been hospitalized with the disease.

Based on cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), I explore expansive learning on the student-music-teacher and institutional levels. The inspirational starting point for the chapter is the professional placement of student music teachers in the Palestinian refugee camp Rashedieh in South Lebanon. Both students and staff from the Norwegian Academy of Music are involved in this project, and both the context and the content of the setting are experienced by student-music-teachers and staff as highly unfamiliar, unpredictable, and challenging—although highly valuable. A particular focus of the discussion relates to the concepts of complexity and contradictions, and how they can function as potential sources for change, development, and expansive learning. I argue that student-music-teachers’ involvement in intercultural projects can create rich opportunities for expansive, intercultural learning. However, in order to achieve this, we have to design educational programs that enhance reflection and dialogue, provide a solid intercultural competence, and create possibilities for existential meetings and placement settings in which student-teachers experience being “the other”. Consequently, students, teachers, and institutions can learn something that is “not yet there”, and be prepared for the crucial challenges of the future.","[{""name"": ""Brit Ågot Brøske"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3102/0034654311404435"", ""10.1386/ijcm.10.1.71_1"", ""10.1080/14613808.2013.781145"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812774.025"", ""10.1080/13639080020028747"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511619847"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2009.12.002"", ""10.1080/13540600902875340"", ""10.14786/flr.v4i3.174"", ""10.1177/030631289019003001"", ""10.1177/1741143215617944"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803932"", ""10.1177/1321103X15590698""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Drawing on theories of the spectacle, it is my contention that interaction and user-experience design, as it pertains to social media platforms, highlights the contemporary conditions and motivations in our society of abundant visual consumption. This article investigates what it means for a social media user to attend to such time-related visual experience. Throughout this piece, I critically survey the relationship between ephemeral Instagram stories’ popularity and the high speed temporality of the social media sphere with emphasis on the digital “picturesque.” Perishable daily sharing on social media reflects a contemplative glimpse into a personal lifespan presented as an object of mass appreciation. I examine how ephemerality as a component of design impacts online sociality through the picturesque visual mode. Contemporary boredom and competitive engagement in high-technological communication networks inform how we might direct digital publics to find alternative pathways to sociality.","[{""name"": ""Balca Arda"", ""affiliation"": [""Kadir Has University ( Istanbul , Turkey )""]}]","[""10.1177/2056305117691544"", ""10.1386/stic.3.1.63_1"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2015.1084349"", ""10.1080/15456870.2015.972282"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.007"", ""10.1162/desi.2008.24.3.4"", ""10.1080/09608780410001676494"", ""10.2307/j.ctvswx8mg"", ""10.1386/padm.3.2-3.139_1"", ""10.1089/cyber.2015.0157"", ""10.1080/10304312.2010.505331"", ""10.1177/13684310222225432"", ""10.1027/1864-1105.20.2.67"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.12.059"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.06.009"", ""10.33965/ijwi_2018161203"", ""10.1108/JCOM-01-2018-0005"", ""10.1002/9781394260782"", ""10.1108/QMR-06-2013-0041"", ""10.1145/2818048.2819948"", ""10.1145/1240624.1240704""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

ELIZA effects can be traced back to a natural language processing program or chatbot named ELIZA and created by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT in the mid-1960s and to Weizenbaum's inspiration, Eliza Doolittle, in Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion. This article examines Shaw's influence on ELIZA and his anticipatory engagement with questions about machine “thinking” and the origin and nature of intelligence that continue to drive research in computer science. It illuminates Shaw's significance for Weizenbaum and the pathbreaking English mathematician and theorist of artificial intelligence Alan Turing. It also proposes how we might reread Shaw's plays, and Pygmalion in particular, in light of what Weizenbaum and Turing found in Shaw.","[{""name"": ""Lawrence Switzky"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Information Systems']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

From a social neuroscience perspective, understanding the cognitive mechanisms that underlie dramatic irony can provide a remarkable opportunity to study ToM in a more ecologically relevant context. While descriptive narrative theories of dramatic irony exist, these have never been studied in relation to contemporary social neuroscience.

These practices include the climate-fiction film The Wandering Earth, which prompts questions about what decolonizing means for China and the impact of climate chaos on the mental well-being of young people; The Living Pavilion, an Australian Indigenous-led project that created a biodiverse event space showcasing Indigenous art making; Dancing Earth Indigenous dance company who use dance as a way to engage Indigenous ecological thinking and Indigenous futurity; water rituals in the Andes of Peru that problematize water policy and ethnic boundaries.","[{""name"": ""LISA WOYNARSKI"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""ADELINA ONG"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""TANJA BEER"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""STEPHANIE BEAUPARK"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JONAH WINN-LENETSKY"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""RULAN TANGEN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""MICHELLE NICHOLSON-SANZ"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/9780822382843"", ""10.2307/3178066"", ""10.1215/9780822385318""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

As risks increase, the political will to pursue cooperative solutions to prevent arms race and war continues to diminish.

These stories appear on the literary websites Brittle Paper, Jalada, Saraba, Flash Fiction Ghana, Adda and African Writer Magazine with a focus on cities and villages. Authored by ten writers from Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Malawi and Egypt, the stories contain elements of fiction that risk perpetuating negative stereotypes about Africa as they imagine their respective settings. However, textual analysis supported by an appreciation of context reveals how the writers use these stereotypes as basis to craft strong African narratives. By doing so, the writers emphasize the effect that places have on characters, theme, setting and the image of Africa. Ultimately, the roles that urban and rural spaces play in online fiction are multifaceted and enhance the African narrative in complex ways.","[{""name"": ""Kwabena Opoku-Agyemang"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419371485 University of Ghana""]}]","[""10.1163/9789401211093_009"", ""10.2979/reseafrilite.49.1.11"", ""10.1080/13696815.2016.1201652""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Therefore, we investigated how digital devices potentially affect significant predictors of preschoolers’ social-emotional and cognitive development, executive functions, and speech. The results obtained revealed that 5-6-year-old children who used digital devices for less than 1.5 hours per day demonstrated an improvement in cognitive flexibility level within a year, while 2.5 hours of screen time caused a decrease in cognitive flexibility. Passive screen time negatively affects children’s phonemic hearing. Opposite to that, active screen time does not affect it. The study revealed that 5-6-year-old children who usually played digital games and watched video content together with their siblings demonstrated more noticeable positive dynamics in inhibitory control than those who did it alone. Moreover, if it was the parents who determined what digital content would be available to their children, the latter demonstrated an increment in inhibitory control compared to the children who made the choice themselves. Junior school children who used digital devices in a cultural way at preschool age had higher level of executive functions development than the children who used the devices only in a natural way. Thus, digital devices are multidimensional tools and, depending on how they are used, the impact on a child’s development may be different.","[{""name"": ""ALEKSANDER N.

By bringing Jacques Rancière’s works on politics and depoliticisation into dialogue with poststructuralist discourse analysis, the article argues that discursive depoliticisation contributes towards authoritarian consolidation and shows how authoritarianism deepens in a co-dependent nexus of domestic and international politics. Focusing in particular on Rancière’s concept of gaps, the article argues that the core mechanism of depoliticisation is to neutralise the gap constitutive of politics proper and that this neutralisation unfolds in discourse, through the logics of archipolitics, parapolitics, metapolitics and ultrapolitics. The article (1) develops a framework for unpacking discursive depoliticisation empirically by conceptualising Rancière’s logics as ideal-typical depoliticising discourses and (2) applies that framework in an analysis of Russian official discourse in recent years (2015–2023). The article thereby explains how discursive constructions have strengthened Russian autocracy: entrenched depoliticising discourses, produced and reinforced in a co-constitutive internal/external sphere, made possible authoritarian consolidation in Russia under Putin and its war on Ukraine. The article puts forward the concept of discursive depoliticisation as a novel perspective on ‘hybrid’ and authoritarian regimes, as well as Russia’s intensified war on Ukraine and full-on autocracy from 2022 onwards.","[{""name"": ""Anni Roth Hjermann"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Cambridge, UK""]}]","[""10.1353/jod.2022.0043"", ""10.1057/s41599-018-0148-y"", ""10.1057/cpt.2008.4"", ""10.1353/jod.2002.0003"", ""10.2753/PPC1075-8216600301"", ""10.1080/21599165.2015.1063487"", ""10.1177/0090591702239444"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1204985"", ""10.3998/mpub.7106945"", ""10.18449/2021C40"", ""10.1080/13523260.2022.2082633"", ""10.1080/13600820701740746"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00396.x"", ""10.4324/9780203966730"", ""10.1353/jod.2006.0030"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410427.003.0011"", ""10.1353/jod.2020.0049"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2008.00735.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781353"", ""10.1080/07388940701860318"", ""10.1080/17448689.2013.818767"", ""10.1080/02634937.2016.1161902"", ""10.2753/PPC1075-8216550506"", ""10.1080/09557571.2019.1590314"", ""10.1080/14623528.2022.2074947"", ""10.1080/14631377.2016.1139303"", ""10.1080/13569310306088"", ""10.1017/S0037677900019707"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748624973.001.0001"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00390"", ""10.1353/jod.2021.0049"", ""10.1177/1354066199005002003"", ""10.1080/13501760500451709"", ""10.1177/1354066106067346"", ""10.1057/9781137409300"", ""10.1017/nps.2022.112"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12752"", ""10.1080/09668136.2020.1815654"", ""10.1080/02634937.2016.1245181"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2016.1251023"", ""10.1353/jod.2022.0015"", ""10.1080/13534640902982983"", ""10.2747/1060-586X.26.3.185"", ""10.1080/09668136.2014.1002680"", ""10.1177/2336825X221132937"", ""10.7591/9781501718397"", ""10.4324/9780203814932"", ""10.1080/00905992.2014.917075"", ""10.1080/09668136.2012.661935"", ""10.4324/9780203559390"", ""10.4324/9780203018200"", ""10.1080/09557571.2018.1564899"", ""10.1016/j.euras.2015.04.001"", ""10.1007/s11186-011-9161-5"", ""10.1080/00472330701408635"", ""10.1080/10758216.2020.1788397"", ""10.1177/0010836716648725"", ""10.1080/09668136.2019.1602594"", ""10.2307/20048274""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Without any vaccine, the key to containing the virus was the timely delivery of educative public health information to people. With a population of 29 million composed of small urban segments, Ghana has enormous rural enclaves where most of her citizens live. This study seeks to explore the nature of Ghana’s COVID-19 campaign, focusing on the communication strategies and the extent to which indigenous communication tools (ICTs) have been employed. Relying on document analysis, Ghana’s COVID-19 campaign rarely deployed ICTs but rather paid lip service to the country’s indigenous resources in public addresses to the nation. It also found that the fight against the virus metamorphosed into political campaigns making WHO’s vital information subservient to images of political figures and political iconography in general. We argue that the nature of the campaign created generalized awareness of the pandemic, but did less to educate the masses on the WHO preventive protocols.","[{""name"": ""Jacob Nyarko"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123228567 University of Cape Coast""]}, {""name"": ""Michael Yao Wodui Serwornoo"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123228567 University of Cape Coast""]}, {""name"": ""Benedine Azanu"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000105138613 Ghana Institute of Journalism""]}]","[""10.4018/978-1-5225-0833-5.ch019"", ""10.1086/680187"", ""10.1111/j.1555-2934.2008.00023.x"", ""10.1386/jams_00041_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Much is said about the importance of different methodologies to the teaching and learning of Law, such as cinema, music and literature. But there is not much said about why it is important. In this sense, the question to be solved is: why cinema can be used as an important pedagogical practice to teach human rights? To answer the question, the main hypothesis, to be tested by Popperian method, suggests that cinema manages to generate an emotional participation of the spectator, including the student. This hypothesis is explained by the theory of projection-identification, which says cinema can eliminate the distance created in the students by the scientific objectification. Moreover, human rights films seem to present a load of truth, increasing the emotional participation of the students; therefore, it seems to increase the will of the student to learn new subjects and get involved in human rights issues.","[{""name"": ""Leilane Serratine Grubba"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Law']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

This study traces these discourses on YouTube, which is one of the social media platforms widely used to raise awareness and also influence public opinion on various issues. Thematic and content analysis are used to identify the dominant themes discussed in the selected videos and also to identify the sentiments expressed by viewers in the comments posted. The issue activation and response model is used to create meaning from the data. The study finds that the themes and the sentiments reflect the dominance of pessimistic and optimistic perspectives on the Africa–China relationship. Furthermore, the study shows that the themes discussed have not offered new perspectives but instead the discussions have repackaged old narratives as part of agenda building efforts by the protagonists. The study, therefore argues that social media have become important platforms for activation of issues on the Africa–China relationship, hence the persistence of these old narratives is attributed to lack of effective responses to issues on social media by both African countries and Chinese officials.","[{""name"": ""Simon Matingwina"", ""affiliation"": [""Zimbabwe National Defence University""]}]","[""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1207/S1532754XJPRR1301_3"", ""10.4135/9781849209793.n4"", ""10.5897/AJPSIR2014.0687"", ""10.1080/17544750.2015.1078386"", ""10.1057/pb.2014.22"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx052"", ""10.1017/S0022278X06001856"", ""10.1080/17544750.2012.701428"", ""10.1386/jams_00009_1""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'Information Systems', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"

This study examined the relationship between perceived credibility of information sources and adoption of COVID-19 preventive strategies among residents in South West Nigeria. The study adopted Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), while online survey and in-depth interview (IDI) were employed as the research designs. Convenience and purposive sampling procedures were used in the selection of 259 respondents and ten participants who were 18 years and above. Data were generated using questionnaire and interview guide. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation and multiple bootstrapping comparison test were used to analyse quantitative data, while qualitative data were transcribed and direct quotations that represented the participants’ opinions were used for the analysis.

10.3366/film.2021.0163,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,"Breathing, Cinema and Other ""Nobjects"" in Camille Vidal-Naquet's Sauvage","This article examines the breathing and breathless body in Camille-Vidal Naquet’s Sauvage (2018). Respiration has been characterised by Peter Sloterdijk, in the first volume of his Sphären ( Spheres) trilogy, as the first extension of the womb. The air we breathe is a “nobject” (a non-object) that escapes the subject-object relation, like the placenta before it. Sauvage engages the respiratory, alongside the placental and the acoustic, as three pre-oral “nobjects” for exploring what Leo Bersani has termed the body’s “somatic receptivity”. Duration, framing, lighting, and camera movements cultivate a spectator’s receptivity to these “nobjects” and participate in acts of sphere formation. This provides a framework for thinking about how cinema itself might function as a “nobject”: a connective medium or sphere that supports and augments a subject, providing a field of protection and attention. However, the film’s presentation of breathlessness also signals a blocked receptivity, an inability to take in, introducing friction and resistance to the discourse of immediacy and exchange that characterises philosophical reflections on breath. Breathlessness has implications for thinking about bodily autonomy and forms of freedom that speak to the queer politics of Sauvage, as well as questions about movement and stillness, animation and lifelessness, that reflect back on the medium of film itself.","[{""name"": ""Emilija Talijan"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford""]}]","[""10.3366/para.2015.0148"", ""10.2307/j.ctv19m61fb"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226579931.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822385981"", ""10.3828/msmi.2016.7"", ""10.1515/9781438454122-007"", ""10.1136/medhum-2018-011631"", ""10.1215/9780822381372"", ""10.1515/9780748649006"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9655.2010.01609.x"", ""10.1515/9780691213279"", ""10.1525/9780520937826"", ""10.3366/para.2017.0222"", ""10.1080/17400309.2018.1444458"", ""10.1515/9781438454122""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

The play offers a model of how the intimate relationship between paper and performance in drama might capture the contradictions of post-racial discourse. In its theatrical staging, the play generally discourages considerations of how racial demarcations might impact the relationships among its characters; however, it explicitly rejects this position in the published “Author’s Notes.” This gap between paper and performance becomes a site for staging a confrontation among an insistence on colour-blindness, ongoing suspicion of racialized bodies, and the seemingly paranoid responses prompted by the convergence of these two forces.","[{""name"": ""Ju Yon Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/01642472-22-2_79-117"", ""10.1177/02632769922050566"", ""10.3998/mpub.368267"", ""10.4324/9781315544786"", ""10.1525/vs.2006.1.1-2.410"", ""10.5040/9781636701363.00000011"", ""10.1525/9780520352919""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

The ballet served as an effective means of unofficial diplomacy between China and Japan, even prior to normalisation of bilateral relations between the two countries. Apart from the expected agents, such as translators and theatre practitioners, this case study also reveals the role of some extraordinary agents, including Chinese Communist leaders, such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, and senior Japanese political figures and institutions. Saturation with political agency renders the Japanese adaptation into a text consumed mostly by audiences from the source culture. The artistic life of the ballet, which was sustained by political needs, demonstrates how fundamental political factors are to research on translation in authoritarian contexts and amid geopolitical tensions.","[{""name"": ""Lintao Qi"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Languages, Literatures, Cultures and Linguistics, Monash University , Australia""]}]","[""10.1075/target.25.3.05aal"", ""10.1080/13556509.2005.10799198"", ""10.1002/9781118312032"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-91030-4"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521849624"", ""10.5325/complitstudies.57.3.0398"", ""10.1093/acref/9780199563449.001.0001"", ""10.59962/9780774815444-011"", ""10.1075/target.25.3.02har"", ""10.1017/S0305741000010961"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-4008-5"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316443439"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5959.2010.00292.x"", ""10.1080/10486801.2011.561490"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199331000.001.0001"", ""10.3998/mpub.19066"", ""10.1075/btl.81"", ""10.4324/9781315691862"", ""10.4324/9781003099789"", ""10.21832/9781853599583-009"", ""10.1515/9780520971905"", ""10.2307/3206632"", ""10.1080/01439685.2014.903038"", ""10.4324/9781315547046""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles, 2019) was released in Brazil, it was mainly received as a left-wing critique of the rise of the far right in the country’s political landscape.

This article refutes this view, borrowing from the analysis of science-fiction revenge fantasies and also following Foucault’s genealogical perspective. It argues that Bacurau actually reenacts Brazil’s foundational colonial violence through its complex temporality, in order to rediscover the forgotten past of real struggles that remain surreptitiously inserted in all levels of society, perhaps in the hope that new ways of resistance may flourish from its spectatorial experience.","[{""name"": ""Jocimar Dias"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Philosophy'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind and opened in Ottawa in September 2017, the unexpected angles of the monument’s towering walls form six triangular “volumes” that constitute a deconstructed and elongated Star of David. Belarie Zatzman frames the NHM’s architecture, itself, as the foundation for conceptualizing an applied theatre project as she speculates about what it might mean to respond to the Holocaust from the present, in a specifically Canadian context. She draws on Rothberg’s concept of multidirectional memory as an approach for gathering participants’ multiple narratives as well as multiple communities’ responses to the Shoah. For Zatzman, the promise and challenge of applied theatre lies in the possibility of interacting with history, beyond passively consuming historiographic narratives.

The purpose of this strategic review of recently published and relevant literature was to assess initial response to pandemics on the continent of Africa, in order to identify how the conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation related to COVID-19 may be identified and mitigated throughout the coming months and years and suggest a research agenda for better informing these issues. The study took the form of a systematic review of the literature relating to COVID-19 misinformation in Africa, especially as it relates to prior viral epidemics of HIV/AIDS and Ebola virus. This research is significant as it sheds light on potential means of mitigating the spread of disinformation, and therefore saving lives as we move through this ongoing pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Oluwakemi Shobowale"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404092862 Swinburne University of Technology""]}]","[""10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30146-1"", ""10.17583/rimcis.2020.5416"", ""10.3389/fcomm.2020.00045"", ""10.1007/s10461-020-02955-6"", ""10.1126/science.369.6499.14"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30600-0"", ""10.1038/s41591-020-0960-y"", ""10.1007/s10461-020-02925-y"", ""10.1007/s10796-017-9810-y"", ""10.4269/ajtmh.20-0135"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30382-0"", ""10.20944/preprints202006.0009.v1"", ""10.17645/mac.v8i2.3223"", ""10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.007"", ""10.1007/s10461-020-02954-7"", ""10.4269/ajtmh.20-0380"", ""10.2196/19659"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0884-z"", ""10.17645/mac.v8i2.3200"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30561-4"", ""10.1386/jams_00045_1""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

With questions of intra- and intergenerational justice being at the heart of the dramatic text, this article draws on conceptions and insights from cultural risk theory to argue that human risk behaviour and decision-making is the play’s main focus and determines characterisation as well as structure. Interrogating the tension between aesthetic form and content, it shows how The Children naturalizes the (post-)apocalyptic condition and strives for a balance of scales with regard to collective and personal crisis. Characteristic of the rapidly growing corpus of contemporary “cli-fi” drama, and in accordance with many of the strategies proclaimed by climate communication theory, the play stages the catastrophic implications of environmental destruction predominantly as collective risk management and in a predominantly realist manner, discarding formal experimentation as well as futurist setting. Yet this article argues that it remains ambiguous what kind of risk management is proposed and whether we should read it as a call for action or as an imaginative means of accepting finitude.","[{""name"": ""Julia Hoydis"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Duisburg-EssenGermany""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1386/smt_00093_1,STUDIES IN MUSICAL THEATRE,1303 Drama Film and Television,"'Why We Build the Wall': Hegemony, memory and current events in Hadestown","Through its unique jazz-inspired score, creative sets and costume design, the 2019 Tony award-winning musical Hadestown tells the classic Greek mythology story of Orpheus and Eurydice, in which Orpheus ventures to the underworld to save his love from an eternity of suffering. In this rhetorical analysis of the musical’s script, cast recording, sheet music and Broadway production, I explore how Hadestown makes statements about hegemony and memory that connect with current events. Hadestown presents the underworld as an industrial wasteland that contrasts with Persephone’s green earth, placing industry and the environment at odds with one another and bringing the audience’s attention to issues including climate change, refugeeism, homelessness and poverty. Hades is presented as an industrial tycoon and a hegemon who exploits his workers, and the song ‘Why We Build the Wall’ serves to highlight the many hegemonic tactics used to maintain control over a populace. I also explore how the references to Hades’ wall provide audiences experiencing the musical after 2016 with a biting critique of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign promise to build a wall to curb immigration at the United States’ southern border, and I suggest that the penultimate song provides audiences with a message that aligns with Hannah Arendt’s view of the purpose of memory: that we must remember the past or, in the words of Hadestown, ‘tell the sad tale’, because we hope that it might turn out differently this time. The messages in Hadestown encourage theatregoers to remember the lessons of history, including difficult memories related to hegemony, because only through remembering can we learn from the past and take the actions necessary to face our current challenges.","[{""name"": ""Valerie Lynn Schrader"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000120974281 Penn State University""]}]","[""10.2307/1146446"", ""10.1386/smt.12.2.199_1"", ""10.2307/j.ctv10tq45f.7"", ""10.1080/00335638309383643"", ""10.1179/itc.2005.23.1.97"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2005.00554.x"", ""10.1386/smt.3.1.13_1"", ""10.1017/S1054204320000167"", ""10.3138/md.47.2.309"", ""10.1353/tj.2008.0075"", ""10.1386/smt.12.2.167_1"", ""10.1386/smt.2.1.5_1"", ""10.1386/smt_00093_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

10.1093/adaptation/apaa002,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,'The Impossible Balancing Act': Reconstructing Liveness with NT Live's Hedda Gabler,"Abstract This article traces Ivo van Hove’s Hedda Gabler from its staging by the National Theatre to its screening in China as a National Theatre Live production. I investigate how as a form of intermedial and international performance, NT Live alters the concept of ‘liveness’ between multiple frames of production and reception. During the delayed international transmission of NT Live, liveness is intertwined with the connections and variations between audience communities, making it an indicator of each experience’s distinctive condition and locality rather than a proof of the reproduction and retainment of sameness. A case study of the National Theatre’s Hedda Gabler from stage to screen and to China reveals that while van Hove’s production constructs an intimate and exclusive community by strengthening the co-present corporeality of performers and spectators in theatre, the delayed screenings, in order to balance the loss of spatial and temporal liveness, employ culturally specific strategies to produce multiple mediatized, digitally ‘live’ experiences for new audience communities. By means of moulding theatre into technology-supported media, utilizing and negotiating with local audience’s horizons of expectations as well as their feedback to the screened production, NT Live adapts the original performance and redefines liveness in exchange for an expanded outreach beyond national and cultural borders. It opens up and engages various audience communities whose participation sheds light on the cultural and political potentials and limitations of liveness in the age of digitalization and multimedia.","[{""name"": ""Yangzi Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of English, University of Cambridge""]}]","[""10.1057/9781137288691"", ""10.2307/1211632"", ""10.5422/fordham/9780823270910.001.0001"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apu015"", ""10.4324/9780203894989"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apx029"", ""10.5040/9781350030497.ch-012"", ""10.5040/9781472526533"", ""10.1080/15021866.2017.1408249"", ""10.5040/9781350030497.ch-003"", ""10.1080/10486801.2010.505770"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apu017"", ""10.4324/9781351260084""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Facebook users dethroned ideas rooted in colonialism that positioned Europeans as superior thought leaders and Africans as inferior and passive recipients of western knowledges and leadership. They also dismissed the doctors as flagrant racists. Facebook users affirmed that Africans were not guinea pigs and Africa was not a laboratory.

When the show is viewed through a feminist lens, it is clear that, far from challenging the meanings of gender in popular culture, Six reproduces them with demeaning stereotypes that conform to the ideals of the male gaze. I conclude that the positive critical reaction to Six owes more to a need within the theatre community to have a successful British musical than to the merits of the show itself, and a wariness on the part of critics in a post-Weinstein era to be seen to question the artistic quality of a female-centric show that women clearly experience as empowering.","[{""name"": ""Grace Barnes"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Scholar""]}]","[""10.1353/tj.2010.a413928"", ""10.1353/tj.0.0059"", ""10.1017/S0261143001001386"", ""10.1386/smt.12.2.167_1"", ""10.1386/smt_00028_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

The focus is on how the relationship between the fictional city and its referential counterpart is foregrounded as well as undermined in a way that destabilizes the ontological status of the storyworlds. Key concepts used in the analysis of the literary space and storyworld are Brian McHale’s “flickering effect” and Bertrand Westphal’s “heterotopic interference.” Deleuze’s “fold” is proposed as a heuristic concept to describe how ontological instability in postmodern storyworlds is shaped. This chapter proposes a reading of Rimminen’s prose from the perspective of apocalyptic undercurrents, which have remained largely unappreciated.","[{""name"": ""Lieven Ameel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/978-1-137-54911-2_49"", ""10.30665/av.74737"", ""10.1076/enst.82.5.420.9576"", ""10.30665/av.74972"", ""10.4324/9780203393321""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

The article explores the screenwriting process involved in creating inclusive and diverse children’s television, drawing on an original interview with Julie Kalceff, the show’s screenwriter and director. Kalceff discusses her screenwriting process writing for and about children who occupy liminal and marginal spaces and the research, writing and consultation processes undertaken to create her pioneering work with trans characters as lead protagonists. The resulting series explores the universal experience of starting the high school journey, while allowing for a normalizing of gender diversity on-screen – hopefully the first of many of its type in the future. By foregrounding historically marginalized characters, screenwriters can explore universal social, psychological and physical trials, and in the process, break down stigmas surrounding LGBTQ people.","[{""name"": ""Natalie Krikowa"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419367611 University of Technology Sydney""]}]","[""10.1177/1329878X20948272"", ""10.1057/9780230610200_1"", ""10.1080/10570314.2011.553876"", ""10.1386/josc.9.2.211_1"", ""10.1386/josc.10.2.131_1"", ""10.1080/01463373.2016.1221438"", ""10.1300/J082v49n01_02"", ""10.4135/9781848608269.n21"", ""10.1177/1329878X20952520"", ""10.1386/josc.7.2.207_1"", ""10.1080/14681811.2015.1080678"", ""10.1386/josc_00003_1"", ""10.1080/08838151.2017.1344667"", ""10.1177/0163443720957553"", ""10.1386/qsmpc.1.1.95_1"", ""10.1177/1329878X17693936"", ""10.1386/josc.6.2.131_2"", ""10.1080/09589236.2015.1021307"", ""10.1386/josc_00070_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Nevertheless, in the last years of the dictatorship, the students of the school were subject to harassment that ended up curtailing their careers.

The consequences include different forms of violence and suffering outside of traditional battlefields. Questioning the analytical value of concepts such as grey zone, hybrid and political warfare, we argue that a positive future of peace and the necessary management of the grey zone absent effective global governance require a better and more honest understanding of violence and domination in both war and peacetime.

10.1215/02705346-8631571,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Wages for Face-Work: Black Mirror's ""Nosedive "" and Digital Reproductive Labor","The episode “Nosedive” from the Netflix series Black Mirror (dir. Joe Wright, Netflix, UK, 2016) provides a dystopian version of a popular narrative about digital culture, according to which the ascent of social media marks the “feminization of the Internet,” its transformation from an open wilderness of hackers to a domesticated web of social performance and consumerism. This essay draws forward an argument implicit in “Nosedive”: social media use is a specific form of labor that Marxist feminists have taught us to call reproductive, the un- or underpaid labor sustaining domestic and social life (and thus also the global economy), which is compelled through normative idealizations that erase its status as labor. Reading the episode and the contemporary social media economy in dialogue with the Marxist feminist Wages for Housework movement, the essay argues that individual social media users’ unpaid digital labor—creating, sharing, and responding to content—sustains the platforms that extract their data as “surplus value.” It further draws on sociologist Erving Goffman’s account of “face-work” in order to clarify the way in which a person’s digital identity is produced in collaboration with others through ceaseless labors of interactive self-maintenance. This analysis foregrounds the limitations of Black Mirror’s political vision and reveals the political and theoretical resources provided by a materialist feminist critique of the tech economy.","[{""name"": ""Erin Greer"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

As such, it looks to the llanto —here collectivity produced—as a powerful act of refusal that, in addition to asserting dissent and iterating a contestation of centuries of sedimented violence, hollows out and routes time-bending pathways to ancestral alter-knowledges. The essay examines this "" llanto space"" as an alternative to the politics of recognition and representation, and the different ways via which it instantiates a refusal of these modalities. Furthermore, it reflects on the history of affect-generating crying through professional criers and the figure of La Llorona as inspirations for the 2018 PerformaProtesta; it also engages with transnational feminist movements that activate collective wails and screams to demand an end to gendered violence. The essay then turns to a close-reading of the three day event, reflecting on the unique politics of the llanto in relation to the other narrative and theatrical elements of the performance.","[{""name"": ""Jade Power-Sotomayo"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Cultural Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Through sparse historical documentation, she has been described as a drunk, traitor, bad mother, thief, ungrateful primitive, shrewd mediator and most recently a heroic foremother of Afrikaans-speaking South Africans. This article tracks these representations, paying particular attention to the 2017 South African-made film Krotoa, and situates this latter representation within theoretical discussions of nationalism and cinema, women in the national heritage narrative and the historic film as a vehicle to express, in its own way, the emotions, trauma and systems of the past still relevant today. We argue that the filmmakers’ attempt to tell the story of Krotoa, while masterfully crafted, artful and poignant, succumbs in the end to a weak nation-building epilogue that does little justice to the nuances of power, oppression and perseverance foundational to Krotoa’s life story.","[{""name"": ""Shanade Bianca Barnabas"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000010109131X University of Johannesburg""]}, {""name"": ""Anna-Marie Jansen van Vuuren"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000101091328 Tshwane University of Technology""]}]","[""10.1017/S0021853700035519"", ""10.1080/03057070802685668"", ""10.1080/17532520701786178"", ""10.2979/blc.2009.1.1.30"", ""10.1017/S0021853700033752"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8219.1996.tb00004.x"", ""10.1017/S0021853798007300"", ""10.1386/jac_00026_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This quantitative content analysis of Kagame’s official Twitter account analysed the first ten years of his tweets and found that he primarily tweets in English, with a positive sentiment about cross-government and cross-border interactions and, in doing so, presents Rwanda as a progressive, democratic player that is connected multilaterally to both African and global affairs. Throughout the decade, Kagame’s tweets evolved from being domestically focused on self-promotion to more globally focused on foreign engagement. While these findings could be indicative of a semi-authoritarian state, they also point to the presence of ‘Twitter diplomacy’ and the use of soft power tactics, which become stronger and clearer in the latter part of the decade.","[{""name"": ""Meghan Sobel Cohen"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000403958791 Regis University""]}, {""name"": ""Karen McIntyre"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404588737 Virginia Commonwealth University""]}]","[""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1162829"", ""10.1108/JCOM-11-2013-0083"", ""10.1163/187119007X240497"", ""10.1177/1742766509348675"", ""10.1177/0002716207312142"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1998.tb02762.x"", ""10.11648/j.hss.20170502.13"", ""10.1177/0002716207311699"", ""10.1080/23743670.2015.1119490"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0043"", ""10.1386/macp_00006_1"", ""10.1093/elt/cci064"", ""10.1177/1077699018782201"", ""10.1177/0032329207308181"", ""10.1353/at.2004.0035"", ""10.1163/18739865-00503013"", ""10.1002/pa.385"", ""10.1386/jams_00031_1""]",['Social Sciences'],['Communication'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

10.3366/film.2022.0190,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,Transferring Suspiria: Historicism and Philosophies of Psychoanalytic Transference,"Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria (2018) aggressively foregrounds a term from the discourse of psychoanalysis, now a relic of twentieth-century philosophical and psychological thought, with which to negotiate a sequence of historical problems specific to its articulation as a remake (adaptation or reimagining) of a 1977 giallo by Dario Argento. The concept is “transference”. Transference traverses the whole semantic field of this film text, offering a hermeneutic device that, we will show, structures its conception and execution. This interpretative tool affords us a conceptual means with which to appreciate the decidedly querulous attitude that Guadagnino's remake assumes as regards its source text. Lodged in what can be described as an antagonism over the “spirit” of a film shot in 1977 is, we feel, a profound difference of opinion over the relationship between aesthetics and politics, and thus a contest over the very concept of a film's “spirit”. Argento's classic deliberately “spiritualizes” the political context of its creation, and particularly its setting during the German Autumn of 1977, in order to produce an oneiric fairy-tale nightmare about innocence abroad. The “spirit” of Suspiria is what must be sacrificed in the 2018 adaptation, in order to rescue its material basis from the amnesia of posterity. This is a film about its own historicism and about historicism in general, and what it costs to produce a “terrible beauty” out of the violence of terror. It is a materialist intervention in the culture of recycling, and offers, as a remake, a critical reading of a film apparently immune to the principle of a remake.","[{""name"": ""Alexander Howard"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Sydney""]}, {""name"": ""Julian Murphet"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Adelaide""]}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195367232.001.0001"", ""10.5406/illinois/9780252037092.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctt9qcnrp"", ""10.5040/9781501336706"", ""10.1590/0103-656420150121"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1x76fgm"", ""10.1525/9780520918276"", ""10.1215/0094033X-2007-001"", ""10.1525/9780520930957""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['General Arts and Humanities', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7038), ('1301 艺术学', 0.7023)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.3366/jbctv.2020.0508,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Three (Working-class) Girls: Social Realism, the 'At-risk' Girl and Alternative Classed Subjectivities","This article focuses on the BBC1 three-part drama Three Girls, broadcast in July 2017, which dramatised the Rochdale child sex-grooming gang scandal of 2011 and won five BAFTAs in 2018. While many of the dominant press narratives focused on the ethnicity of the perpetrators, few accounts of the scandal spoke to the need for a sustained public discussion of the class location of the victims. This article considers how the process of recognising the social problem of sex-grooming is set up for the audience through a particular mode of address. In many ways the drama rendered visible the structural conditions that provided the context for this abuse by drawing on the expanded repertoires of television social realism: the representation of the town as abuser; the championing of heroic working-class women; and the power of working-class vernacular. However, ultimately, the narrative marginalises the type of girl most likely to be the victim of this form of sexual abuse. By focusing on the recognisable journey of the girl ‘who can be saved’ this renders the impoverished girl as already constitutive of the social problem. The analysis draws attention to the difficulties of recognising alternative classed subjectivities on television because of the way that boundary-markers are placed between the working class and the poor and suggests that the consequence of these representations is to reify ideas about the victims of poverty and exploitation.","[{""name"": ""Helen Wood"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0038038505058367"", ""10.1080/17400300903306995"", ""10.1386/jptv.4.2.199_1"", ""10.5204/ijcjsd.v4i2.214"", ""10.1080/14797585.2015.1134061"", ""10.4324/9780203490198"", ""10.1068/d237t"", ""10.1093/screen/25.4-5.2"", ""10.1080/01426398708706232"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198123699.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0163443714566900"", ""10.1177/1468796812448019"", ""10.5920/idp.2015.1154"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-55506-9_11"", ""10.1177/0038038598032002003"", ""10.5204/ijcjsd.v4i2.211"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5cg8m6"", ""10.1093/bjsw/bcw160"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-71776-0_4"", ""10.1093/screen/18.1.61"", ""10.1177/1363460713511104"", ""10.1080/02643944.2018.1464593""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

While Africa experienced its own COVID-19 challenges during the pandemic, the Afropessimistic outlook of total collapse and carnage did not become a reality. In fact, with the popular uptake of TikTok as the pandemic wore on, Africans began social media trends that kept many globally entertained as they navigated new lockdown realities. This study looks at three of these TikTok trends, namely #JerusalemaChallenge, #DontRushChallenge and #DontLeaveMeChallenge. Through textual analysis, the study explores if and how these trends provided counternarratives to Afropessimism. With dominant themes such as humour and dance emerging, findings suggest that these trends offered content that can be read as contributing to challenging Afropessimism through cultivating African digital agency and representation.","[{""name"": ""Fungai Machirori"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419367611 University of Technology Sydney""]}]","[""10.1080/13504630051345"", ""10.1080/02560046.2011.615118"", ""10.1017/asr.2020.90"", ""10.1386/jams.11.2.257_1"", ""10.1080/21674736.2017.1335946"", ""10.1386/jac.6.2.175_1"", ""10.1007/s41134-021-00161-5"", ""10.2979/blc.2010.2.1.14"", ""10.1177/0008125620958166"", ""10.58680/ee201011557"", ""10.1080/10131752.2021.1987646"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57878-5_7"", ""10.1080/17513057.2011.598044"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2021.1974518"", ""10.1080/13696815.2015.1123143"", ""10.1080/13696815.2016.1201652""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Psychology']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

10.1093/adaptation/apad028,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Theorising the Uncanny Adaptation through Hamlet,"Abstract Adaptations possess an uncanny quality, especially when those adaptations are built on tragic narratives. When audiences see the same characters relive the same plots in different contexts, what was once familiar becomes unfamiliar, and a kind of haunting is produced. Adaptations that move across mediums from stage to film to video games carry an especially prominent potential for uncanniness. Using adaptations of Hamlet and specifically the video game, Elsinore, to track this evolution reveals that the temporal ambiguity that the uncanny adaptation produces within a tragic narrative carries the potential to enact ethical aims, while also suggesting a way forward in thinking about that narrative’s future. By first defining the uncanny adaptation and examining Elsinore as a case study, this article explores the ethical potential that is made possible through the uncanny elements of tragic adaptation.","[{""name"": ""Mckenzie Bergan"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Connecticut , USA""]}]","[""10.1353/nlh.2007.0038"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-58526-4_4"", ""10.1080/15295036.2022.2080845"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5931.2006.00230.x"", ""10.1525/fq.2012.66.1.16"", ""10.4324/9781315088617-16"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apaa001"", ""10.4324/9780203095010"", ""10.4324/9780367821722-5"", ""10.1515/9783110272239.70"", ""10.1353/itx.2014.0012""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Memes, as we argue, give people a sense of power as they offer commentary that critiques and mocks the government policies and ineptness, simultaneously offering a sense of hope and relief in face of the pandemic. With a focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, this study probed the nature, character and the why of humour in two southern African countries: South Africa and Zimbabwe. Findings show that memes were used to comment on lockdown regulations and speak against public authorities, to raise awareness of COVID-19 and expose poor health delivery systems. Our findings show that memes in South and Zimbabwe were used to bring dialogue about the COVID-19 pandemic and communicate health-related issues.","[{""name"": ""Mbongeni Jonny Msimanga"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000010109131X University of Johannesburg""]}, {""name"": ""Lungile Augustine Tshuma"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000010109131X University of Johannesburg""]}, {""name"": ""Trust Matsilele"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000010177134X Cape Peninsula University of Technology""]}]","[""10.1177/1461445615602378"", ""10.1080/03057070.2010.485800"", ""10.1177/0002716207311877"", ""10.1177/1748048514568759"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a098185"", ""10.1080/10810730591009781"", ""10.1080/15295030903325347"", ""10.1080/17531055.2018.1547257"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81969-9_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-47733-2_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-79279-4_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81969-9_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-79279-4_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-47733-2_3"", ""10.1093/afraf/adn086"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81969-9_6"", ""10.1016/j.jare.2020.03.005"", ""10.1080/02533952.2015.1106124"", ""10.1177/0973258615614420"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-32682-1_12"", ""10.1080/15405702.2011.562099"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91310-0_11"", ""10.1080/00913367.2012.749082"", ""10.1386/jams_00073_1""]",['Psychology'],"['Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"

The production participates in a new practice of recasting history through musical theatre, and does so through an innovative approach to representation and character. OSF’s production reimagined Curly as a queer Black woman; the matriarch of the town, Aunt Eller, as a trans woman; and the secondary romantic couple, Will Parker and Ado Annie (here Ado Andy), as an interracial, gay male partnership. This alteration of the characters’ identities takes a bold new step in the trajectory of theatrical casting practices, challenging the entrenched white supremacy and patriarchy of the theatre industry. In this article, I situate OSF’s method of casting Oklahoma!, which I call ‘recuperative casting’, in the landscape of broader discourse related to casting and musicals that represent US history; I argue that this casting strategy seeks to remedy the whitewashing typical of productions of canonical musicals.","[{""name"": ""Lindsey Mantoan"", ""affiliation"": [""Linfield University""]}]","[""10.1353/tj.2015.0054"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-49331-6_1"", ""10.1386/smt_00004_1"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1zrvhps.13"", ""10.1353/tj.2003.0071"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1zrvhps.6"", ""10.1386/smt_00054_1""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

The film’s most relevant formal feature, the digitally created ‘long take’, also partakes of the director’s well-known penchant for technological and formal experimentation when telling a story. In Birdman, cinematic form is closely related to its thematic concerns, particularly the impact of technology on global processes. This article explores the confluence between form – digital cinema – and content in Birdman. It looks at the global virtual space created by the internet and social networks and how they affect our sense of being in the world. To this end, the film exploits the possibilities and connotations of the apparently uninterrupted single take that comprises most of the duration of the film and of the composited, digital-realistic space thus created.","[{""name"": ""Celestino Deleyto"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121560064 Universidad de Zaragoza""]}, {""name"": ""María del Mar Azcona"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121560064 Universidad de Zaragoza""]}]","[""10.5406/jfilmvideo.67.1.0003"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-58573-8_1"", ""10.1386/ncin.7.2.101/1"", ""10.1386/slac_00037_1""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

During this period (1948–2019), 86 Israeli screen stories have engaged with the motif of Israel’s military/wars. However, only two of them were written by women and focused on the female Israeli soldier. The marginal position of screen stories based on Israeli women’s experience in the military presents a unique opportunity to unravel the notions female screenwriters have of women’s conduct in a patriarchal military culture. Our findings suggest that female Israeli screenwriters (a) propose a dual vision for women – on the one hand, they are portrayed as silenced, while on the other they use silence as a coping tactic; (b) represent the hegemonic male as silencing women’s voices even though in some cases women silence hegemonic men; and (c) depict military service as an opportunity for women to unravel their femininity.","[{""name"": ""Mira Moshe"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000098246981 Ariel University""]}, {""name"": ""Matan Aharoni"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000098246981 Ariel University""]}]","[""10.1080/13531040903169735"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.2307/3178151"", ""10.1177/002200276901300204"", ""10.1177/053901847101000201"", ""10.1353/sho.1994.0110"", ""10.1177/0957926591002004001"", ""10.1177/096701067800900203"", ""10.1080/10509208.2011.646626"", ""10.1080/13537121.2018.1478786"", ""10.1080/14680777.2018.1546208"", ""10.1353/sho.2005.0197"", ""10.1057/palgrave.sth.8700032"", ""10.1353/sho.2005.0208"", ""10.1353/frm.0.0016"", ""10.1086/690919"", ""10.1080/14680770500271586"", ""10.1386/josc_00036_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

The concepts of authenticity and realism are used as analytical tools to examine empirical findings from twenty focus group discussions with students, in 2016 and 2017. The results reveal that young Qataris see Turkish serials as offering a more authentic representation of real life than local and regional television serials. Although Turkish drama serials do not provide a window into actual life within Turkish society, they are perceived as offering a realistic depiction of characters and storylines representing Turkey’s social life and culture. This article establishes that Turkish serials’ dubbing into a colloquial Syrian dialect has heightened audience experience of authenticity. The fact that Turkish dramas were created against the backdrop of a Muslim country with significant ethnic and cultural similarities further elevated the Arab audiences’ perception of authenticity.","[{""name"": ""Miriam Berg"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000405481261 ISNI: 0000000494747403 Northwestern University Qatar""]}]","[""10.1177/136754940000300305"", ""10.1002/tesq.33"", ""10.1080/10304312.2014.870868"", ""10.1177/1461445601003004006"", ""10.1177/1527476411423675"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb02914.x"", ""10.1080/08838150903310468"", ""10.1177/016344388010004006"", ""10.1177/1367549417751150"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01419.x"", ""10.1080/15405702.2013.747940"", ""10.1177/0002764211398078"", ""10.1177/1742766518780168"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-46051-8_13"", ""10.1086/432238"", ""10.1353/anq.2012.0007"", ""10.1177/1461445601003004005"", ""10.1177/1461445601003004003"", ""10.1080/1070289X.2013.823089"", ""10.1386/jptv_00068_1""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.3366/jbctv.2022.0642,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,"The Prudential Group Archive: Alexander Korda, London Film Productions and Denham Studios","This article examines the Prudential Group Archive, a valuable resource for the study of London Film Productions (LFP), the British film company founded by Alexander Korda in 1932. The Prudential, a long-established British life insurance and financial services company, invested in LFP at a time when the British film industry was expanding, and Denham Studios was built as a major production facility in 1936. The primary sources generated through this connection provide a rare opportunity to study the financial operation of a major film company as well as to evaluate the strategies that were put in place by the Prudential to monitor its progress throughout its time as an investor which ended in 1945. The article uses the archive to gain insights into the Prudential’s motives for backing the film industry, the building of Denham, the management of Korda and LFP and the impact of the Second World War. It is demonstrated how the archives provide a unique resource for understanding the pressures on film production in the 1930s, as well as highlighting rarely glimpsed material, infrastructural and collaborative aspects of film history such as the practical operation of studios during the Second World War when they were affected by bomb damage, requisitioning and labour shortages. Unlike archives relating to the British film industry which predominantly deal with film personalities and film titles, the Prudential Group Archive documents the crucial importance of the financial aspects of film production. The article also points to documentation in other collections that can productively be interrelated with the Prudential’s archives.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Street"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1162/octo.2009.128.1.22"", ""10.2307/j.ctv125jsnh.9""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"
10.1017/S0266464X21000294,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,The Nazi Occupation of Theaterwissenschaft,"Theaterwissenschaft was first developed as an academic field in Germany. In Berlin, Max Herrmann pursued a sociological and iconological approach; in Cologne and in Munich, Carl Niessen and Artur Kutscher followed an ethnographic and mythological direction, respectively. With the Nazi takeover in 1933, Herrmann was dismissed and replaced by a non-scholar, Hans Knudsen. Niessen’s open-air Thingspiel was co-opted to support Nazi ideas of Volkstum. Kutscher renounced his liberal background and joined the Party. In Vienna, Josef Gregor got the local Gauleiter to found a Central Institute for Theatre Studies that disseminated anti-Semitic propaganda. The most egregious case is that of Heinz Kindermann, who rose to be the most influential aesthetician of National Socialism, proposing a biological foundation to theatre studies and offering a racial-eugenic approach to theatre history. As this article demonstrates, in the post-war period, theatre studies sedulously avoided dealing with the Nazi interlude, where official denazification permitted these men and others to carry on teaching and publishing, winning honours and titles. It was not until the 1980s that attempts were made to confront this past.

It focuses on how the cabinet of curiosities and the Chinese box, two traditional, limited spatial forms, in Wunderkammer become a means to global imaginary and ecological thinking. By drawing on the ideas of Timothy Morton, the chapter argues that the radical interconnectedness of the objects depicted is a textual representation of mesh. The analysis shows how containers and boxes turn into open and porous spaces, places become strange, and global space grows into junkspace. Finally, it argues that the collection turns away from the globe, apprehended as a financial-technocratic system, toward the world ecology of the planet.","[{""name"": ""Kristina Malmio"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9781315745978-2"", ""10.1080/14688417.2013.800339"", ""10.2307/j.ctv3znz1s.4"", ""10.4159/9780674056732"", ""10.1057/9781137318015"", ""10.4324/9781315745978""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

In the show, Gadsby argued that as a marginalized person – a gender-nonconforming lesbian from rural Tasmania – she was doing herself a disservice when she invited audiences to laugh at her trademark self-deprecating humour. Gadsby framed her decision to quit comedy partly as a problem of persona: her practice as a comedian was to take actual, sometimes traumatic, events from her life and turn them into jokes, which she described as ‘half-told stories’. So framed, the problem with Gadsby's comic persona is the way it both presents and truncates her traumatic experience. When she refuses to be funny, Gadsby casts herself as something like Sara Ahmed's ‘feminist killjoy’, a spoilsport figure whose unhappiness positions her as a source of tension. In this article I consider how Gadsby's decision to quit comedy, and the terms in which she articulates that decision inNanette, can help us think about varied modes of humourlessness and comic possibility.","[{""name"": ""SARAH BALKIN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/2040610X.2014.967017"", ""10.4135/9781446211779"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316403570"", ""10.1080/2040610X.2018.1437167"", ""10.1086/689666"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-23275-8"", ""10.1215/9780822380504"", ""10.1177/1367877915595479"", ""10.1515/9783110911114"", ""10.1086/689657"", ""10.1215/9780822392781""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

Intellectual property show, a Chinese term generally referring to television shows adapted from internet fiction (and to a secondary extent, video games), explicitly suggests an adaptation form and logic particular to an environment characterized by converging media and digital transformations of cultural production. Using the 2019 Chinese hit show All is Well, adapted from an internet novel with the same name, I approach intellectual property show as a media artefact situated at the volatile convergence of political demand, business interest, and new media affordances through adopting an integrative approach to contemporary adaptations in China. By attending to both the material context of production and the media text itself, I join the current explorations in adaptation studies for methods that answer the why and how of adaptation.","[{""name"": ""Shuxi Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Anthropology, University of Oregon""]}]","[""10.1163/9789401202756"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apz033"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apx023"", ""10.1177/1354856507084422"", ""10.1177/1367877904040603"", ""10.1177/1354856507084415"", ""10.1007/978-1-84457-686-9"", ""10.4324/9781315867243"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199331000.001.0001"", ""10.1080/21620555.2015.1032162"", ""10.1177/1527476415616193"", ""10.5040/9781501300110"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apt012"", ""10.1093/adaptation/aps028""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The series poses a stunningly exacting sense of the slave narrative coupled with an ambitious charting of antebellum nineteenth-century America, at once familiar and uncanny. As visual historiography, The Underground Railroad enacts an irreconcilable challenge to the writing of history and, furthermore, to the political and aesthetic capacities of televisual seriality.

10.7146/nts.v32i1.120408,NORDIC THEATRE STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Sounding the Arctic in Chantal Bilodeau's Climate Change Plays,"Quebec-born playwright Chantal Bilodeau has been responding to the challenges of dramatizing anthropogenic climate change by developing an eight-part Arctic Cycle, each play of which is set in one of the nations that claims Arctic territory. Sila (2014) immerses audiences into a complex network of humans, animals, and mythical beings crisscrossing the Canadian Arctic. These movements circle around the Inuit concept of sila, which is the life-giving force of breath and voice. Thus, the sonic world of Sila focuses on voices speaking words, on performance poetry, and on the sounds of breath and wind. Bilodeau’ s second Arctic Cycle play, Forward (2016), addresses the long-term impact of Fridtjof Nansen’s polar exploration of the 1890s on Norway’s economy and society. In terms of sound, Forward features multiple musical performances rangingfrom traditional songs to European opera arias and Lieder to contemporary Norwegian electro-pop. The sonic features of both plays stress interdependence across time, space, as well as (non-)human, earthly, and metaphysical realms. Sila and Forward address climate change in a non-universalizing manner which promotes a heterarchical (rather than hierarchical) aesthetic fit for a growing awareness of planetary relationality.","[{""name"": ""Nassin W.

By the end of 2021, TikTok had surpassed the American search engine Google as the most visited website on the Internet. With its billion unique visitors each month, it is the only top 10 website whose parent company (ByteDance) is located outside the U.S. In the article, I analyze the specifics of TikTok’s presence in the Russian segment of the Internet, its gradual politicization, and the problems the platform has faced over the last two years. In 2021, TikTok surpassed VKontakte, the most popular social network in Russia, in terms of time spent using the app. And, although the service had some friction with the Russian authorities, there is still no full-fledged replacement for it. So far, Yappy—the Russian analog for TikTok—does not look like its serious competitor at all. The article covers what concerns the authorities of other countries have about this social network, and how TikTok in general affects Internet culture. I look into the values propagated by TikTok among young people. In the conclusion, I put forward a hypothesis, which requires further study, that TikTok is now a super effective world-scale soft power tool of the People’s Republic of China.","[{""name"": ""NIKOLAI N.

This article reconsiders the ‘absurd’ with respect to Beckett and the human/nonhuman relations in the Anthropocene. It draws upon affect theory and posthumanism, arguing that the absurd in Beckett’s theatre takes root in the theatricalization of posthuman affects, which connect the human body and the non-human world. Posthuman affects subvert human sovereignty and disintegrate humans into nothingness. Yet they also give birth to a different cosmic ontology, which involves a call for change in the relationship between the human and the nonhuman. Revisited from the perspective of posthuman affect, the absurd in Beckett’s theatre acquires new complexities that bring glimmering possibilities of endurance and comfort in the face of catastrophe. Chen Chang is an assistant researcher of the English Department at Nanjing University, where she recently completed her PhD dissertation on Beckett and the posthuman body. She has published several articles on Beckett as well as in gender studies.","[{""name"": ""Chang Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

So, they wanted IDs … [The person tabling] asked me, “Well I need some id. Do you have any ID?” And the way he said it, he knew I wouldn't have any id. It was like I wasn't even there. I was invisible. He was just going through the motions of making the sound. But he didn't know he was dealing with R-C-B. So when I dropped my passport, and I do mean dropped my passport on the table, that's when I got respect.—RCB, Los Angeles Poverty Department (LAPD)What does it mean to perform presence or selfhood? What conditions necessitate these performances? In the opening epigraph, RCB articulates an instance when transparency was mapped onto his body—a moment in which he was simultaneously invisible as an individual and hypervisible as the projections of stereotypes surrounding homelessness and blackness collided on his body, rendering his history, present, and future as instantly knowable. During the election cycles of 2010, 2012, and 2014, KevinMichael Key, a prominent, formerly homeless Skid Row activist, community organizer, and member of the Los Angeles Poverty Department (LAPD), ran for a position on the Downtown Los Angeles Neighborhood Council (DLANC). As part of his campaigns, Key sought to help homeless residents of Skid Row exercise their right to vote. One instantiation of this objective involved tabling in the neighborhood. In a show of support, RCB lined up to vote and subsequently encountered the tabler. “And the way he said it, he knew I wouldn't have any ID. It was like I wasn't even there. I was invisible.” As understood by RCB, the tabler did not expect homeless individuals to possess government-issued identification. Instead of acknowledging RCB's individuality and subjectivity, the tabler assumed that RCB's status as homeless meant not having state ID, an official marker of occupancy in a state-recognized residence. In this interaction, RCB's political subjectivity was under erasure, invisible. For RCB, in this confrontation, homelessness marked him as a knowable (non)subject—a generic homeless man.","[{""name"": ""Kimberly Chantal Welch"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3998/mpub.235634"", ""10.2307/j.ctt21pxmkv"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226370958.001.0001"", ""10.2307/466434"", ""10.1215/9780822376491"", ""10.1215/9780822390145""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Gender Studies', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

The proliferation of frames in these works enacts an itinerary of the aesthetic strategy I call ‘post-cinematic unframing’ that particularly comes to the fore when framing is explicitly thematised – as it is, for example, when pop-up bubbles are superimposed on a scene to display characters’ text messaging, or by superimposing, stacking, juxtaposing, and collaging images.","[{""name"": ""Lisa Åkervall"", ""affiliation"": [""the University of Gothenburg""]}]","[""10.1093/screen/hjw004"", ""10.1162/grey.2010.1.39.11"", ""10.7312/columbia/9780231172431.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674263024"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1871.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226329024.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9789048505265"", ""10.1086/448747"", ""10.1162/152638101750172984"", ""10.1002/9781118275733.ch18"", ""10.1080/019722499128394"", ""10.1215/9780822380764"", ""10.5749/9781452958552""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'History and Philosophy of Science', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Tunde Kelani) and Ikoka (2004, dir. Peddie Okao). Apart from highlighting the kind of challenges which politics evokes in the country and the possible ways of remediating them in a contemporary context, the study argues that Nollywood filmmakers have good reasons for shying away from politics, as interesting as it may be; it creates discomfort for governments as well as for the filmmakers. The former on account of their allergy to the truth and the latter on the likelihood of their works being confiscated, banned or even risk to life. The conclusion reached is that filmmakers who engage politics in their creative works deserve encouragement because growing societies such as Nigeria, are in dire need of spokesmen and women, who as change agents, can engender positive and developmental agendas in their ecosystems.","[{""name"": ""Osakue S.

This review traces selected Playback Theatre research that has sought a deeper understanding of empathy in Playback Theatre practice and its relationship with social justice. The author foregrounds what has resulted from these studies regarding empathy in Playback Theatre and their relationship with Nancy Fraser’s social justice model, particularly the cultural dimension of recognition.

10.3366/jbctv.2020.0541,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,Performing the National? Scottish Cinema in the Time of Indyref,"This article examines Scottish cinema during the period 2012–17, assessing the ways in which the nation's constitutional debate, Scottish–English relations and discourses of national identity were engaged with thematically by films produced in this period. It argues that Scottish cinema in this period ‘performs the national’, in that a number of films flag their national status and engage with discourses of national identity at a distance, unburdened by any serious demand for national representativeness, as might be the case with a ‘national cinema’. From a corpus of texts in the period which offer the possibility of being read through discourses of the nation, two genre films, White Settlers and Sunshine on Leith, are analysed in detail for their differing narrative takes on Scottish–English relations in the contemporary moment. The article concludes by surmising that while film criticism in Scottish cinema has historically been overly determined by an ideologically driven pursuit of national representativeness, perhaps the welcome emphasis which has been placed in contemporary criticism on broadening the scope of Scottish cinema studies beyond the national has implied a false dichotomy between the two, whereas it is more likely that we can locate Scottish cinema somewhere in between.","[{""name"": ""Robert Munro"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199563692.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9780755694822.ch-001"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748625369.001.0001"", ""10.1080/25785273.2019.1602334"", ""10.57132/jiss.149"", ""10.4135/9781529714692"", ""10.1515/9780748633937"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-33196-2_8"", ""10.1515/9781474452052-010"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2012.0097"", ""10.1080/1472586X.2013.830000"", ""10.5040/9780755697281"", ""10.1002/9781118482889.ch26"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474408196.003.0014"", ""10.1093/fmls/XXXIV.3.274""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Professional and amateur historians described the production as an evolutionary throwback or curious hybrid of ancient Greek and medieval theatre, regarding it as an object and event of antiquarian interest. Foreign female travelers attended the play in impressive numbers, and their accounts provide insight into contemporary women's readings of theatre, travel, spirituality, gender inequality, gendered spaces, and cultural difference. Protestant writers reflected uneasily on the play's communication of spiritual truth by means of images. And all of these accounts, whether published in the popular periodical press or as monographs, in turn encouraged increasing numbers of travelers to make the same journey—represented sometimes as a religious and sometimes as an artistic pilgrimage—to the isolated Bavarian village.","[{""name"": ""Leanne Groeneveld"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0009640711001235"", ""10.7591/9781501729928"", ""10.1057/9780230621275"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262015141.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9780691188232"", ""10.1037/14178-000"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195371277.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10739-014-9377-0"", ""10.1093/0195174089.001.0001"", ""10.1037/13474-000"", ""10.4324/9780203471494""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

This study adds to the understanding of the discursive functions of memes by exploring emergent themes in coronavirus-related memes and investigating the discursive strategies applied by Nigerians to portray the pandemic. A qualitative analysis of 170 purposively selected COVID-19-related memes revealed the prevalence of six overarching themes. It was observed that meme creators employed a combination of humour, non-humour and sarcasm in driving awareness about the pandemic and highlighting existing but less-discussed sociopolitical and socio-economic issues exacerbated by the recent health crisis.

The witches’ songs implicitly critique the patriarchal order that has led to the dysfunctional intrigues of the courtly world from which they are excluded and offer the audience an alternative centred on a joyful, supportive community of women. To do this, Middleton’s play subverts the musical dynamics of Ben Jonson’s Masque of Queens (1609), deconstructing conventional associations between music and social harmony, and inviting the audience to explore alternative social formations.&#x0D; &#x0D;","[{""name"": ""Andrew Loeb"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

This article examines the shifting visions of Miss Havisham as an object of horror in film, fashion, kitsch, on the internet, and, more recently, as a revisionary figure of female resistance in Tony Jordan’s television series, Dickensian. In so doing, it maps the tensions that exist between conventional representations of Miss Havisham that envisage her as an irrational, embittered, and narcissistic old woman and those that construct her as a representation of justified female rage against the intersecting forces of patriarchy, capitalism, and ‘toxic masculinity’.","[{""name"": ""Camilla Nelson"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Notre Dame Australia""]}]","[""10.4324/9780203824979"", ""10.1057/9780230281691"", ""10.3917/etan.651.0030"", ""10.5040/9781408167656"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64559-9"", ""10.1080/13555502.2016.1170427""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

On the other hand, it also provides formal analysis of the collective’s filmography and explores how feminist ideas and praxis are deployed in its films.

It analyses them in relation to the role of left-wing film internationalism in political documentary in Latin America and builds an ‘other’ history of a Mexican film institution that in the 1970s was uniquely politicized as a result of the 1968 Mexican student movement and, later, the influence of Latin American exiles.

The focus lies on Remington Steele (1983–87) and Magnum, P.I. (1980–88) as two middlebrow TV series that emphasize the male lead and link in with shifts in the visual culture of the era. Both series function within frameworks of middlebrow TV and visually focus on their male heroes’ bodies. The article analyses the term middlebrow in 1980s television and develops this concept more by exploring narrative structure and what Horace Newcomb has termed the ‘cumulative narrative’. The article then moves on to discuss the visual framing of the male lead as directed by an assumed heterosexual female gaze. In the course of this, it examines the parameters of the televisual image and the conditions that frame objectification on television. Due to the focus on a heterosexual female gaze, middlebrow television becomes strongly linked with women’s culture. This allows for conclusions surrounding the construction of the middlebrow, masculinity and early 1980s television culture. Exploring this cultural politics, and thus revealing a cultural hierarchy, is deemed important here, as it allows for an analysis of the role of nostalgia, both in 1980s and more contemporary television cultures going forward.","[{""name"": ""Mareike Jenner"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122995510 Anglia Ruskin University""]}]","[""10.1093/screen/22.4.32"", ""10.1093/screen/26.2.42"", ""10.1093/screen/16.3.6"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474461986.003.0002"", ""10.1386/jptv_00070_1""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Social Psychology', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

It has posed not only a health challenge but also an economic and a linguistic burden. Linguistic burden because many efforts are being made by stakeholders to appropriately represent or codify the manifestations of the disease in unambiguous and understandable terms. Hence, one of the major platforms where COVID-19 has been variously represented is the social media. This study, therefore, focuses on a multimodal analysis of the representation of the COVID-19 pandemic on two social media platforms: Facebook and WhatsApp. The study adopts Kress’s social semiotic model as theoretical framework. This model explains the meaning affordances of verbal and non-verbal semiotic resources. It examines communicators’ intentions and makes meanings through multiple semiotic modes. This model is adopted because it offers a sociological perspective to the interpretation of visual texts. Twenty-five semiotic resources comprising memes and flash headlines, which were purposively sourced from Facebook and WhatsApp over a period of twelve weeks between April and July 2020, were analysed in the study. The data were subjected to both pictorial and simple descriptive linguistic analysis. The study reveals that COVID-19 memes extend economic and social concerns in Nigeria.

Artificial Intelligence. I begin by going over the manner in which the film’s contemporary reviewers produced the sense of a film full of tension and unresolvable contradiction, something largely attributed to the radically distinct styles and world-views of Spielberg and his mentor, Kubrick. The paper then goes on to read Kubrick’s work (mainly on treatments of the developing story) with the last two writers he worked with on the project. This return to the narrative work Kubrick and his writers expended on the story, demonstrates that far from being the project of irreconcilable differences between the two writers, Kubrick always faced and never successfully resolved a tension within his story between science and myth, between a narrative of scientific orientation (humanity evolving into machines) and a narrative of fantasy and myth (a machine-boy who becomes human).","[{""name"": ""Graham Allen"", ""affiliation"": [""School of English and Digital Humanities, University College Cork""]}]","[""10.1093/adaptation/apv021""]","['Environmental Science', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

While non-linear television has in some ways disrupted linear television’s ties to nostalgia, it has also seen a rise in aesthetically nostalgic programming. The introduction considers how this connects to broader cultural nostalgic trends, themselves fuelled by diversifying media technologies, and complicates meanings traditionally associated with period programming. It explores implications of recycling predominantly western and mediated pasts, and considers how the pandemic has highlighted intersections between linear television, non-linear platforms and differing forms of nostalgia. Finally, it introduces the dossier’s three short essays.","[{""name"": ""Caitlin Shaw"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121619644 University of Hertfordshire""]}]","[""10.1057/9781137327581_13"", ""10.1177/1461444814541523""]",['Psychology'],['Social Psychology'],"[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

Infotainment is not only understood as a focus on specific topics such as scandals and show business, but also as an effort to make information programs more engaging and visually dynamic. First, we establish conceptual definitions for infotainment and infotainment topics. Subsequently, we analyze the evening news broadcasts of the three channels aired between March 2021 and September 2023, using selected parameters. The survey reveals that while infotainment style is present in the evening television news, it is not a typical characteristic. Only one of the studied TV channels covered news related to celebrities, and diversification in news format was observed on just two of the analyzed channels. The findings indicate that, at least within the Russian television system, there is no direct correlation between the form of media ownership and the adoption of an infotainment style in the evening news. It can be hypothesized that the personal and professional characteristics of editorial staff members play a significant role in the utilization of infotainment. However, this aspect requires further investigation. Additionally, the survey demonstrates that there is no correlation between program ratings and the presence of infotainment within them.","[{""name"": ""YULIA I.

This article recovers overlooked and little-known documents about the film to show that it is the expression of an active cinematic Third Worldism forged in previous years between the legacy of the Resistenza Partigiana (Italian Resistance) and the Third World struggles of the 1960s.

10.3167/proj.2021.150204,PROJECTIONS-THE JOURNAL FOR MOVIES AND MIND,1303 Drama Film and Television,How Many Emotions Does Film Studies Need? A Phenomenological Proposal,"A look at current emotion research in film studies, a field that has been thriving for over three decades, reveals three limitations: (1) Film scholars concentrate strongly on a restricted set of garden-variety emotions—some emotions are therefore neglected. (2) Their understanding of standard emotions is often too monolithic—some subtypes of these emotions are consequently overlooked. (3) The range of existing emotion terms does not seem fine-grained enough to cover the wide range of affective experiences viewers undergo when watching films—a number of emotions might thus be missed. Against this background, the article proposes at least four benefits of introducing a more granular emotion lexicon in film studies. As a remedy, the article suggests paying closer attention to the subjective-experience component of emotions. Here the descriptive method of phenomenology—including its particular subfield phenomenology of emotions—might have useful things to tell film scholars.","[{""name"": ""Julian Hanich"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Groningen, Netherlands j.hanich@rug.nl""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-19601-1_38"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4120.001.0001"", ""10.1037/aca0000023"", ""10.1353/nlh.2012.0025"", ""10.1353/cj.2017.0041"", ""10.1007/s11031-013-9385-y"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0128451"", ""10.1177/1754073912468165"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2958.1993.tb00304.x"", ""10.3167/proj.2016.100202"", ""10.1037/a0035690"", ""10.15581/003.30.35757"", ""10.3167/proj.2016.100202"", ""10.3167/proj.2019.130201"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2010.03.002"", ""10.1093/monist/onz031"", ""10.1093/monist/onz032"", ""10.4324/9780203098226"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.105.3.602"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190867133.001.0001"", ""10.1093/monist/onz037"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.105.3.602"", ""10.1080/02699930903274322"", ""10.3167/proj.2014.080203"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4120.001.0001"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0128451"", ""10.1093/monist/onz035"", ""10.1037/a0015343"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0192-9"", ""10.1515/jso-2015-0051"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2010.03.002"", ""10.1017/BrImp.2012.18"", ""10.1037/a0015343"", ""10.3167/proj.2019.130104"", ""10.1007/s11097-018-9597-4"", ""10.2307/1213732"", ""10.5840/studphaen2016161"", ""10.1111/jaac.12606"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190867133.001.0001"", ""10.1386/fiin.13.3.48_1"", ""10.3167/proj.2019.130201"", ""10.4324/9780203098226"", ""10.1177/1754073912468165"", ""10.1037/rev0000174"", ""10.1057/9780230294851_12"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262019958.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5760.001.0001"", ""10.3167/proj.2017.110206"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00444"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198790648.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11031-013-9385-y"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2958.1993.tb00304.x"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0178899"", ""10.1080/15213260701853161"", ""10.1007/978-3-476-05353-4_12"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0192-9"", ""10.1177/1754073914534479"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262019958.001.0001"", ""10.1017/BrImp.2012.18"", ""10.1093/monist/onz031"", ""10.1093/screen/hjs007"", ""10.2307/2025831"", ""10.7227/FS.8.9"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198790648.001.0001"", ""10.1515/jso-2015-0051"", ""10.1093/monist/onz037"", ""10.1093/monist/onz035"", ""10.3167/proj.2014.080203"", ""10.1037/aca0000023"", ""10.7227/FS.8.9"", ""10.2307/1213732"", ""10.5840/studphaen2016161"", ""10.1093/screen/hjs007"", ""10.1111/jaac.12606"", ""10.4324/9781315180786-32"", ""10.3366/film.2011.0023"", ""10.15581/003.30.35757"", ""10.1093/monist/onz032"", ""10.1007/978-3-476-05353-4_12"", ""10.1037/a0035690"", ""10.4324/9781315180786"", ""10.1017/S0140525X17000309"", ""10.3167/proj.2016.100205"", ""10.3167/proj.2017.110206"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5760.001.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520943919"", ""10.1353/cj.2017.0041"", ""10.1080/15213260701853161"", ""10.1017/S0140525X17000309"", ""10.1353/nlh.2012.0025"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0178899"", ""10.1080/02699930903274322"", ""10.1057/9780230294851_12"", ""10.4324/9781315180786"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-19601-1_38"", ""10.1037/rev0000174"", ""10.3366/film.2011.0023"", ""10.3167/proj.2019.130104"", ""10.1007/s11097-018-9597-4"", ""10.1177/1754073914534479"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00444"", ""10.4324/9781315180786-32"", ""10.1386/fiin.13.3.48_1"", ""10.1525/9780520943919"", ""10.2307/2025831"", ""10.3167/proj.2016.100205""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The film industry survives several pressing challenges from within and outside Nigeria, perhaps more than its counterparts anywhere else. Although there is no denying that the quality of its output has significantly improved, its survival has little or nothing to do with that. Many critics, including the Motion Pictures Practitioners Association of Nigeria (MOPPAN) leadership, call ‘bad’ films, are still being made. Romantic movies, laden with a typical and predictable pattern of the love triangle, song and dance sequences among other appropriated and plagiarized Bollywood modalities, remain the favourite of producers and arguably that of the audience. However, according to some surveys, such films lack merit in the realm of critical film discourse in Africa and beyond. This article is set out to discuss this issue through a content analysis of a recent film titled Sareena (Nuhu 2019). The movie, released in 2019, is a bloated, implausible melodrama and a direct mimicry of a famous Indian film, Kaabil (Gupta 2017).","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Muhsin Ibrahim"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000085803777 University of Cologne""]}]","[""10.1386/fiin.5.4.77"", ""10.1080/1369681022000042655"", ""10.1002/9781118320792.ch14"", ""10.2307/1161182"", ""10.1086/678255"", ""10.1386/jac.4.1.25_1"", ""10.1386/jams_00081_1""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Trust in God represented one of the pillars of the government’s narrative, next to an attitude of ‘denialism’, and the fight against ‘fake news’. This article analyses the evolution of the narration of COVID-19 on Twitter during the first three phases of the fight against the disease, focusing on the use of the religious narrative. Within Burundi’s contemporary sociopolitical context, analysis of these narratives on social media best demonstrates how the fight against COVID-19 in Burundi was a fight for the control of the narrative, and by extension for political legitimacy.","[{""name"": ""Antea Paviotti"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107903681 University of Antwerp""]}]","[""10.1177/1750635217727311"", ""10.1080/23743670.2015.1092455"", ""10.1177/1750635217698334"", ""10.1177/0263395715622967"", ""10.1386/jams_00055_1""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Infectious Diseases', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1386/jptv_00090_1,JOURNAL OF POPULAR TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,From private pleasure to erotic spectacle: Adapting Bridgerton to female audience desires,"In this article, we look at how medium and genre shaped the Netflix adaptation of the first two Bridgerton novels and mediated the depictions of sex and desire to fit medium-specific expectations surrounding sexual content made for women. The showrunners for Netflix’s Bridgerton (2020–present) articulated a desire to depict sex from a female perspective, and with a ‘female gaze’, but the series is also instrumental in defining that perspective in ways that often differ from the approach of the novels’ female author. The contrast between the original and the adaptation reveals social norms and beliefs about content that excites women as well as stark differences in print and television norms. In attempting to use a female gaze, the adaptation also constructs the female gaze as distinctly separate from what is depicted in the novels and as limited to specific forms of ‘looking’. We first explore how this is implicated in choices that were made about the adaptation of violent or aggressive sex for the show. Bridgerton avoids depictions of aggression present in the novel and falls back on traditional depictions of appropriate feminine desire. Secondarily, we discuss depictions of sexual consent in the novel and the series with a particular emphasis on the implications colour-blind-casting has for the depiction of violations of consent.","[{""name"": ""Amber Davisson"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000090536271 Keene State College""]}, {""name"": ""Kyra Hunting"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368438 University of Kentucky""]}]","[""10.1080/00497878.1994.9979026"", ""10.1007/s12119-011-9092-3"", ""10.1080/10304319809365753"", ""10.1093/screen/16.3.6"", ""10.1080/0816464042000334519"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-27107-8_10"", ""10.1037/a0027910"", ""10.1386/jptv_00090_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

It focuses on two different site-specific performances created by the author in the South Ayrshire region of Scotland: CauseWay: The Story of the Alloway Suffragettes and In Hidden Spaces: The Untold Stories of the Women of Rozelle House. These were created with a practice-as-research methodology and aim to offer new models for the use of character in site-specific performance practice. The article explores the variety of methods and techniques used, including verbatim writing, spatial exploration, and Herstorical research, in order to demonstrate the ways in which women’s narratives were represented in a theoretically informed, site-specific manner. Drawing on Phil Smith’s mythogeography, and responding to Laurajane Smith’s work on gender and heritage, the conflicting tensions of identity, performance, and authenticity are drawn together to offer flexible characterization as a new model for the creation of feminist heritage performance. Victoria Bianchi is a theatre-maker and academic in the School of Education at the University of Glasgow. Her work explores the relationship between space, feminism, and identity.

But its educational application has been criticized throughout the decades for underuse of the distinctive potential of film: to raise interest. To understand more fully film’s potential for learning, we propose a dynamic model of viewer interest and its underlying cognitive and emotional mechanisms (film’s interest raising mechanisms or FIRM model). In addition, we present an analysis method for assessing the interestingness of films in learning contexts. Our model marries interest theories from cognitive film theory and educational psychology and captures the dynamics of interestingness across a film as depending on a balance between challenge posed and coping potential provided.","[{""name"": ""Winnifred Wijnker"", ""affiliation"": [""Leiden University, Netherlands W.Wijnker@biology.leidenuniv.nl""]}, {""name"": ""Ed S.

As an early adopter of digital and ‘cusp-of digital’ technologies (Hi-8 cameras, Mini-DV tapes, email, digital editing suites), Dwoskin’s creative work aligns with and backdates the “Crip Technoscience Manifesto” developed by Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch in 2019. Drawing on Dwoskin’s films and his archive, now housed at the University of Reading Special Collections (UK) Chamarette reframes Dwoskin’s late creative activity as tactics of technological adaptation, crip technoscience, and spheres of influence within digital and non-digital realms. These digital activisms ultimately give cause to reflect on the ambivalent, interdependent, friction-filled relationships between filmmaking, digitality and disability.","[{""name"": ""Jenny Chamarette"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

I argue that it is possible to consider something cinematic without the presence of moving images. Assertions in favour of the cinematic nature of podcasts often employ the visual imagination of listeners evoked by heightened audio characteristics that a particular podcast may possess. By focusing on film-centred podcasts specifically, which, in terms of content and form, are implicitly and often explicitly concerned with properties of the cinematic, I argue for a more conceptual analysis of the idea of a visual form of audio. While many film-oriented podcasts provide a supplementary celebration of cinema culture rather than manifesting a unique cinematic experience of their own, there are examples of film-centred podcasts that attempt to actualise what I will call an “audio-cinematic” experience, deploying the creative potential of the podcast to manifest an experiential aura that evokes a cinematic imagination. I analyse the sonic dimensions of audio-cinematic podcasts including my work with Neil Fox on The Cinematologists Podcast.","[{""name"": ""Dario Llinares"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Brighton""]}]","[""10.1515/9781503600041"", ""10.5040/9781628929966"", ""10.2307/1211632"", ""10.1177/1354856506066522"", ""10.1386/rjao.14.1.7_1"", ""10.1080/19376529.2017.1370714"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayi018"", ""10.4324/9780203006276"", ""10.1215/9780822380252"", ""10.1353/cj.2012.0008"", ""10.1080/14682753.2017.1362170"", ""10.1353/book5250"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90056-8_7"", ""10.5325/studamerhumor.1.1.0020"", ""10.1080/19376529.2015.1083374"", ""10.1080/19376529.2015.1083155"", ""10.7202/029498ar"", ""10.1515/9780691213279"", ""10.1525/fq.2005.58.4.2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90056-8_10"", ""10.5040/9781501328671"", ""10.1162/lmj.2007.17.55"", ""10.4324/9781315713793-47"", ""10.1177/2056305119880002""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Communication', 'History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1386/jptv_00062_1,JOURNAL OF POPULAR TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Who is this who is coming? From neurosis to neurodegeneration in television adaptations of M. R. James's 'Oh, Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad'","This article discusses two BBC television adaptations of M. R. James’s classic ghost story ‘Oh, Whistle and I’ll Come to You, My Lad’ (1904), the first directed by Jonathan Miller (1968) and the second by Andy de Emmony (2010). Arguing that de Emmony’s film takes Miller’s as a point of departure, it attempts to track the progressive ‘psychologization’ of James’s tale, a development that it explores with reference to Sarah Cardwell’s notion of ‘meta-textual’ lineage. The article outlines how Miller knowingly reimagines James’s story as a Freudian parable by drawing on the resources of classical psychoanalysis and its understanding of neurosis as the expression of a dynamic interior conflict, one in which something repressed menacingly returns. It goes on to read de Emmony’s film, which reorganizes the story around a case of dementia, as an effort to extend the tale into the psychic terrain of the ‘new wounded’, a term coined by philosopher Catherine Malabou to describe emergent psychopathologies unique to neurological injury or degeneration. Taking conceptual support from Malabou, the article demonstrates both the self-consciousness with which the later adaptation builds from its antecedent and its reinscription of the story within a frame of reference that specifically exceeds the psychoanalytic ontology presupposed by Miller. The films reimagine and contemporize the Jamesian haunting – with its climactic coming of a mysterious other – in ways that are utterly distinct but also cumulatively psychological. Looked at in apposition, the article suggests, they exemplify adaptation not simply as a revival or reconstitution of a past text but as an ongoing, intertextual and incremental labour of reinvention.","[{""name"": ""Nicholas Ray"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368403 University of Leeds""]}]","[""10.1057/978-1-137-56902-8_7"", ""10.1017/S0144686X10000693"", ""10.1386/jptv.6.1.105_1"", ""10.1386/jptv_00062_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"
10.1093/adaptation/apz009,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Unethical Adaptation: Indigenization and Sex in Chan-wook Park's The Handmaiden (2016),"Abstract In contemporary cultural scenes saturated by ‘intermediality’ and ‘transmediality’, adaptation studies have challenged the distinction and hierarchy between the source and its adaptation, the author and the reader-spectator, and a variety of genres and media. While early critics of adaptation studies centred on fidelity criticism, recently Linda Hutcheon breaks free from literary elitism and emphasizes how stories, ‘like genes’, adapt to new environments ‘by virtue of mutation’. Hutcheon argues, ‘the fittest [stories] do more than survive; they flourish’ in today’s fierce competition for ‘cultural selection’. This postmodernist notion of adaptation as proliferation, however, remains curiously reticent about the ‘value’ of such proliferation. My article argues that in the era of textual proliferation, adaptation has an ethical responsibility to voice the story of the socially and sexually ‘unfit’. I then analyse The Handmaiden as a failed attempt at this ethical project. Directed by Chan-wook Park, a South Korean auteur, The Handmaiden borrows from Sarah Waters’ Fingersmith (2002), a novel about female romantic friendship in nineteenth-century England. Although Park’s visually stunning film epitomizes the indigenization of the ‘fittest’ story, its graphic portrayal of lesbian sex and change of setting leaves the question of sexual objectification of Asian women and Japanese colonization unanswered.","[{""name"": ""Soo Yeon Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Hankuk University of Foreign Studies""]}]","[""10.1057/9781137375773"", ""10.1177/1464700107074195""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

Phenomenological Notes on Remediation and Colourization of Black-and-White Footage,"Abstract The article analyses the problem of colouring black and white archival footage in Spain in Two Trenches: The Civil War in Colour (Espa ñ a en dos trincheras . La guerra civil en color, Francesc Ecribano and Luis Carrizo, 2016), which was made by digitizing and colouring more than 450 surviving films of the Spanish Civil War. The analysis focuses on the kind of affects and perceptual mechanisms which might ensue from the colourization of archival black and white footage, and on the justification of the use of colour to authenticate an event that has already happened. At the beginning of the paper, the author briefly reviews the approaches of the increasingly close relationship between mediatization and memory, then focuses on the justification of colourization in the light of the Spanish documentary and compares it with issues of perceptual realism. In the final part of the analysis, the author examines the historical consequences of the reconfiguration of the past in colour.1","[{""name"": ""Kamilla Simor"", ""affiliation"": [""1 Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania ( Cluj-Napoca , Romania ), University of Pécs ( Hungary )""]}]","[""10.4324/9780203066935"", ""10.15353/kinema.vi.1071"", ""10.1515/ausfm-2018-0008"", ""10.1515/9783110436372"", ""10.5040/9781350251977"", ""10.1515/9783110207262.6.389"", ""10.1080/13534645.2011.605570"", ""10.7765/9781526137531.00018"", ""10.1177/0163443716664484"", ""10.1080/01439680120075473"", ""10.1057/9781137470126_2"", ""10.4324/9781315637235-1"", ""10.1177/17506980211010936"", ""10.1080/2040350X.2018.1536019"", ""10.2307/2928520"", ""10.2307/1213468"", ""10.4159/9780674042834"", ""10.15664/fcj.v0i17.2082"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195099669.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Museology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

The aim of this study is to assess whether the wellbeing and self-concept of young people who choose to take part in drama activities are significantly different from those adolescents who do not. A group of 198 subjects between the ages of 14 and 20 years participated in the study. The results showed some significant differences in certain wellbeing components – environmental mastery and personal growth – in favour of drama students. One of the most relevant results was the finding of important gender differences in the impact of drama experience on adolescents’ psychological wellbeing and self-concept. Drama girls showed higher levels of self-acceptance, environmental mastery and global wellbeing than non-drama girls. The study also revealed better academic, social and physical self-concepts. These results are discussed in terms of their educational implications in adolescence.","[{""name"": ""Vicente Alfonso-Benlliure"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012173938X University of Valencia, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Tomas Motos Teruel"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012173938X University of Valencia, Spain""]}]","[""10.1080/030572499103025"", ""10.5993/AJHB.41.6.7"", ""10.1080/08929092.2000.10012519"", ""10.5964/ejcop.v6i1.141"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-818849-1.00002-3"", ""10.1037/aca0000257"", ""10.1080/00220670309598801"", ""10.2190/EM.30.2.b"", ""10.2190/IC.29.2.c"", ""10.1080/1047840X.2020.1820214"", ""10.1080/13632752.2017.1287337"", ""10.1080/1356978042000185911"", ""10.21165/el.v45i3.812"", ""10.3390/healthcare11060839"", ""10.1002/jocb.33"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.82.6.1007"", ""10.1080/10400419.2020.1821553"", ""10.1348/000709910X503501"", ""10.1007/s11482-021-09943-5"", ""10.24908/eoe-ese-rse.v11i0.2407"", ""10.1080/13569783.2018.1494562"", ""10.24331/ijere.628712"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2014.08.006"", ""10.1111/ap.12221"", ""10.1007/s10964-006-9037-6"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.57.6.1069"", ""10.1080/15401383.2020.1754987"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95681-7_14"", ""10.1007/s11218-005-4791-y""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Education', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Safety Research']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.7146/nts.v33i2.132872,NORDIC THEATRE STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Theatre Talks - How to Accommodate Hygge in Theatre Experience,"Almost each year, the pop-cultural world is buzzing with a “new” Nordic word that can bring a piece of Nordic life to every home. Lagom, fika, fredagsmys or hygge - they all refer to slowness, break, taking a moment to feel good and happy, being considerate. Those concepts are believed to be a Nordic approach to life - and a very desirable one.When I think of theatre in this context, one Nordic invention comes to my mind: theatre talks, which emerged as an audience reception research method in Sweden. They proved to be an effective audience development practice (even for non-theatregoers) in Australia (Scollen), Denmark (Hansen; Lindelof), and Poland (Rapior) because (among other things) they bring the element of pleasure, community building, and feeling safe into the theatre experience especially for non-attenders.In this article I will focus on looking at theatre as a possible “oasis of deceleration” in the constantly accelerating world, using Hartmut Rosa’s theory of social acceleration. By going through the development of theatre talks, I will demonstrate what theatres can gain from using this method - both in attendance and image. I will deliberate on how theatre can become a metaphorically “hyggelig” place for anybody during times when everybody ought to live faster and faster.","[{""name"": ""Daria Skjoldager-Nielsen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

We account for other variables: inflation, film budget, genre and film runtimes. Our results indicate that including just one conversation between two female characters is associated with approximately 23 per cent higher box office revenue in the North American domestic market and 27 per cent higher box office revenue outside of North America. Not all representation is created equal: quality representation (in contrast to a ‘quantity’ measure of representation) has a more significant relationship with the box office. Contrary to often-stated beliefs that increased representation of women in film results in lower economic returns, our findings indicate that there is a significant economic benefit to increasing female on-screen portrayals.","[{""name"": ""Jeremy K.

Instead of framing Jude’s aesthetic in terms of the Eisensteinian montage, as many reviewers have done, the article addresses the way in which these films insist on the tensions between media, on creating an ontological collage, not only a cinematic montage. The collage effect of the films materializes in sensuously and intellectually layered permutations that connect different media and shares some traits with the Surrealist play of thecadavre exquis. The mixture of heterogeneous materials becomes a strategy (informed by the ideas of Walter Benjamin) to reflect on history in the conditions of postmemory as well as a way to explore the relationship between media and reality through various positions of spectatorial engagement and the affective metalepsis between reflexivity and immersion.1","[{""name"": ""Ágnes Pethő"", ""affiliation"": [""Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania ( Cluj-Napoca , Romania )""]}]","[""10.26530/OAPEN_628783"", ""10.7765/9781526131157"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1zcm3q4"", ""10.4324/9780203066935"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474435499.003.0007"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-55309-6_10"", ""10.1525/var.1994.10.1.44"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-14853-9"", ""10.1215/17432197-7725507"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474405140.003.0004"", ""10.1515/ausfm-2016-0004"", ""10.1086/448681"", ""10.1215/9781478003434"", ""10.5040/9780755604180"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1b0fvq4"", ""10.3167/proj.2010.040206"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474405140.003.0013"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474435499.003.0001"", ""10.1515/ausfm-2016-0016"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190238247.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203385661-7"", ""10.1515/9780822396680"", ""10.2478/ausfm-2014-0024"", ""10.1515/9780804794008"", ""10.1515/9789048517114-004"", ""10.1515/9780857453525-009""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

To counter this tendency, Toby Lee offers up two recent nonfiction films that deploy what she calls the “unreality effect” as a vital strategy of political resistance. INAATE/SE/ (2016, Adam Khalil and Zack Khalil) spars with settler colonial history through a contemporary re-imagining of an ancient Ojibway prophecy, while Layer (2015, Ruth Jenrbekova and Maria Vilkovisky) tells a tale of human oviparity as an allegory for transgender life. Looking at how each film not only presents an alternative reality, but actually pushes back on the notion of reality itself, Lee argues that these works demonstrate the radical potential of the unreal—as experiential category, as representational strategy, and as a politics—and the necessity of reclaiming it as a strategy, both historically and today.","[{""name"": ""Toby Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The article draws from two popular musicians in Zimbabwe, Winky D and Jah Prayzah and their use of music as an unconventional journalism format to comment on political trajectories in Zimbabwe. We argue that the two musicians have polarizing or competing discourses that either dissident or support the establishment. Theoretically, we use Mano’s conceptual framework that views music as a journalism variant in contexts where mass media and opposition parties are weak. Methodologically, the study employs a multimodal approach and thematic analysis. The study concludes that Zimbabwe’s two popular youthful musicians have been engaging in cold-war like fights that mirror existential political battles between the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front party (ZANU-PF) led by Emmerson Mnangagwa and the then Movement for Democratic Change Alliance (MDC-A) party led by Nelson Chamisa. After the 2017 elections the MDC-A reconfigured itself and became the Citizen Coalition for Change (CCC).","[{""name"": ""Trust Matsilele"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121802449 Birmingham City University""]}, {""name"": ""Mbongeni Jonny Msimanga"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000010109131X Johannesburg Institute for Advanced Study, University of Johannesburg""]}, {""name"": ""Lungile Augustine Tshuma"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000010109131X University of Johannesburg""]}]","[""10.1177/002193478501500403"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.2307/2578553"", ""10.1080/02560054.2008.9653373"", ""10.2307/852848"", ""10.1017/S0022226700012949"", ""10.1080/004676099284528"", ""10.1177/1750698008093796"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-1986-7.ch013"", ""10.1080/17290376.2018.1444506"", ""10.1080/14616700601056858"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-98705-3_4"", ""10.2307/1160062"", ""10.1080/18125980.2018.1483207"", ""10.1080/18125980.2015.1031453"", ""10.1080/02533950408628683"", ""10.1057/9781137543462_1"", ""10.1080/1350463032000129993"", ""10.1080/0305707042000215338"", ""10.16997/wpcc.38"", ""10.1080/152422202760387702"", ""10.17159/2309-9070/tvl.v.55i1.1583"", ""10.1080/23743670.2021.1956557"", ""10.1080/18125980.2016.1182383"", ""10.1177/1470357205053749"", ""10.1080/18125980.2011.570294""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Music', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Although Goei is generally not considered a pioneer of Singaporean New Wave film, his works shed light on the emergence of the New Wave in the mid-1990s and a second New Wave, starting around 2005. Whereas the first New Wave was characterized by double mimicry of western and East Asian film in an attempt to critique the Singaporean government and colonialism in Southeast Asia, the second New Wave was driven by a search for local authenticity. In addition, Goei’s films provide insight into tension between the national and transnational in Singaporean film, stemming from the nation’s colonial past, filmmakers’ ambivalent alliance with the People’s Action Party (PAP) and the small size of the local market.","[{""name"": ""Carolyn FitzGerald"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122978753 Auburn University""]}]","[""10.1080/10304310600987254"", ""10.1080/14649370500463166"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-92280-2_2"", ""10.1080/14649370701238839"", ""10.1386/ac.17.2.1_1"", ""10.1386/ac_00011_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Broadway adaptation of a Chinese classical drama,"The 1946 Broadway premiere of Lute Song represents a milestone in reception of the Chinese dramatic tradition in the United States. Despite its yellowface and ‘Oriental pageantry’, it must be situated at the beginnings of a more respectful relationship to China and Chinese people, as the American stage began to move beyond treatments of China dominated by racist vaudeville or fantastical fairy tales. Instead, Lute Song emerged from a classic text, the long drama Pipa ji – even as its own casting and staging inherited some of the same problematic habits of representing Asia. Lute Song, one of several indirect adaptations of Chinese dramas in the American mid-century, represents a milestone as the first Broadway show inspired by American immigrant Chinatown theatre and the first Broadway musical to be based on Chinese classical drama, mediated through European Sinology.","[{""name"": ""Josh Stenberg"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000041936834X The University of Sydney""]}]","[""10.2307/1124474"", ""10.1007/s11059-011-0104-y"", ""10.2307/3207557"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1qv5n9n.8"", ""10.2307/1124523"", ""10.1386/smt_00031_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"
10.1353/tj.2023.a908733,THEATRE JOURNAL,1303 Drama Film and Television,"From Witnessing to Redress: Objects, Remnants, and Wreckage after the Sewol","Abstracts: On April 16, 2014, the Sewol Ferry capsized off the southwestern coast of South Korea, killing 304 people, including 250 high school students. The incident traumatized Koreans, who helplessly watched the capsized ferry sink on live news. The Korean government's (mis)handling of the disaster and its aftermaths made the sinking of the Sewol Ferry the most galvanizing event in contemporary South Korean history. In the wake of the Sewol, activists and artists created memorials in honor of the victims—or rather their absence—as well as their loved ones who remember them. Using critical scholarship from memory studies and performance studies with ethnographic methodologies, this essay explores three of these works, combining tools of close reading and participant observation. In analyzing the three works, I focus on their strategic use of physical objects belonging to victims or their loved ones—namely, childhood artifacts, a blanket, and a bus. Through these objects, activists and artists go beyond an invitation to witness the Sewol and its tragic aftermaths; rather, they index the sustained nature of loss as well as critique the persistence of government malfeasance and unaccountability. Ultimately, I theorize the three case studies as activist performances that animate the material remains of disaster in the service of materializing truth and redress.","[{""name"": ""Areum Jeong"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1215/02705346-8085135,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Ethical Whiteness and the Death Drive: White Women as the New War Hero,"This article looks at two controversial war films—Eye in the Sky (dir. Gavin Hood, UK/South Africa, 2015) and Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (dir. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, US, 2016)—both of which feature white female protagonists as conflicted but central participants in the racialized domains of war and political machinations. While one film takes on a serious ethical polemic (the innocent lives of civilians caught in the visual crosshairs of drone cameras) and the latter is a romantic comedy following the adventures of a journalist in Afghanistan, both visually capture important ethical questions around white imperial violence, the disposability of brown lives, and the current political shift of and toward white women in positions of intense power. The article argues that these two technologies of domination—visual culture that entertains its citizens and political practice that secures its citizenry—are profoundly interlinked public archives in which to read what here is called “ethical whiteness,” its relationship to the death drive, and the gendered currency of both. Using the figure of the little brown girl that sits at the center of Eye in the Sky, the fetish object central to the story, alongside the comedic characterology in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, the article underscores how ethical whiteness is tightly bound up with the death drive but in a way that destroys through the empathetic dimension. Analyzing these widely circulated visual moments of “ethical whiteness” exposes a pernicious social text that prioritizes the necropolitical through the necro-pedophiliac.","[{""name"": ""Moon Charania"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Gender Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.3366/jbctv.2020.0509,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Erasing Diversity: Mediating Class, Place, Gender and Race in The Moorside","This article is focused on the 2017 BBC drama, The Moorside. Over two episodes, it revisits the events surrounding the ‘disappearance’ of Shannon Matthews, a nine-year-old schoolgirl from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, with the drama culminating in the arrest of Shannon's mother, Karen, on charges of child neglect and perverting the course of justice. We identify the events depicted in The Moorside and, in particular, the media's framing of them, as central to the formation of pervasive and corrosive narratives of ‘broken Britain’. In revisiting the Matthews case, The Moorside re-animates and, we argue here, further perpetuates these discourses by rendering them through highly constructed and reductive frameworks of class, place, gender and race. Our analysis considers the textual strategies at work in the drama, some of its key intertexts, questions of diversity – in class terms – within the BBC, and the role of Sheridan Smith, The Moorside's ‘star’, as a conduit for narratives of regional and social identity.","[{""name"": ""David Forrest"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Beth Johnson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1386/jptv.4.2.195_7"", ""10.1179/its.2008.63.2.261"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511566011.002"", ""10.1093/screen/25.4-5.2"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1t8928t"", ""10.1093/screen/hjw021"", ""10.1080/14766825.2013.877472"", ""10.1177/0038038594028004008"", ""10.5040/9781350222359""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

First, we outline how neuroscientific approaches to moving images could be embedded in the embodied, enactive cognition framework and recent predictive processing theories of the brain. Within this framework, we understand filmic engagement as a specific way of worldmaking, which is co-constituted by formal elements such as framing, camerawork, and editing. Second, we address experimental progress. Here we weigh the promises and perils of neuroscientific studies by discussing the motor neuron account to camera movements as an example. Based on the limitations we identify, we advocate for a multi-method study of film experience that brings cognitive science into dialogue with philosophical accounts and qualitative in-depth explorations of subjective experience.","[{""name"": ""Joerg Fingerhut"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Munich, Germany joerg.fingerhut@hu-berlin.de""]}, {""name"": ""Katrin Heimann"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University, Denmark katrinheimann@cas.au.dk""]}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

It shows how the film portrays its protagonists as part of the Mexican countercultural movement, even as it adopts a critical view of that movement. Not only are the protagonists unsuccessful with their single action of protest, they are also engaged in problematic relationships with female and Indigenous characters. The ambivalence towards counterculture in El cambio is similar to the portrayal of leftist protest movements in other films by the same director. This article expands on the recognized relationship between this film and the director’s oeuvre. It demonstrates that the problematic portrayal of relationships between the protagonists and Indigenous and female characters relates to its historical context and other films from the time period. In particular, it shows that these interactions correspond with some of the ways that the Mexican state and the countercultural movement adopted paternalistic views of Indigenous people and replicated patriarchal relationships between men and women.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Janzen"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000009075106X University of South Carolina""]}]","[""10.1057/9780230101203_3"", ""10.1353/rmr.2015.a603913"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2t4cp8.16"", ""10.2307/1212204"", ""10.1386/slac_00044_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Eight years later, on 12 July 1981, in the midst of dictatorship, six airplanes again flew over Santiago in military formation. This time, however, the planes did not drop bombs. Instead, they scattered four hundred thousand pamphlets with a text that urged Chileans to claim their space, thoughts, and lives by asserting the potential for artistry within all people. This art action, titled¡Ay Sudamérica!(Oh, South America!) and orchestrated by the Colectivo Acciones de Arte (Art Actions Collective, or CADA), subversively re-created a central moment from the violent history of the military coup in order to disturb and articulate an alternative course for that history (Fig. 1). In doing so, CADA challenged the regime's conception of Chilean citizenship by calling for an expanded space of existence and invoking the possibility of an artistic and contestatory subjectivity within everyone.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Joan Thompson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/978-1-349-95100-0"", ""10.1525/california/9780520289901.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781503620308"", ""10.5040/9781408177075"", ""10.1215/9780822388548-007"", ""10.1215/9780822385721"", ""10.1215/9780822385318"", ""10.2307/29739790"", ""10.1215/9780822390732-005"", ""10.4159/9780674495548"", ""10.2307/j.ctvckq6gm"", ""10.4324/9780203852897"", ""10.4067/S0717-71942017000100003""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In addition to this, psychometric instruments to assess self-esteem, quality of life (QoL), depression, and purpose in life were administered prior to and after the five-week intervention. Findings are supported by qualitative analysis and are not statistically significant, but suggest an amelioration of depressive symptoms as well as other benefits.","[{""name"": ""María Luisa Mondolfi"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000120976738 University of Vigo""]}, {""name"": ""Myriam Savage"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000102905872 California Institute of Integral Studies""]}, {""name"": ""Sara Fernández-Aguayo"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000120976738 University of Vigo""]}]","[""10.1590/1980-57642015dn93000013"", ""10.1177/0891988719874130"", ""10.1002/1097-4679(196404)20:2<200::AID-JCLP2270200203>3.0.CO;2-U"", ""10.1046/j.1468-1331.2002.00484.x"", ""10.1002/mds.10294"", ""10.1080/02630672.2011.558355"", ""10.1016/0197-4556(86)90005-5"", ""10.1080/13607863.2016.1199012"", ""10.1177/1471301215580895"", ""10.1080/02630672.1999-2000.9689522"", ""10.1016/j.jagp.2019.03.005"", ""10.1002/mds.27602"", ""10.3233/JPD-140472"", ""10.1016/S0197-4556(97)00102-0"", ""10.1386/dtr_00060_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Medicine']","['Conservation', 'Social Psychology', 'Rehabilitation']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.72), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7194)]]"

It employs the perspective of the small state literature to analyse the activities of a small European Union (EU) member state’s government that had to face a mismatch between its policy priorities and policy framing at the EU and domestic level. The article focuses on the arguably common situation of a small state’s government failing to shape a policy internationally and facing a backlash at home. On the basis of a qualitative study of primary and secondary sources as well as semi-structured interviews, the article explores how the Czech debate on GDPR prioritised the bureaucratic burden and costs resulting from the GDPR implementation over the need for privacy as an integral part of human dignity highlighted at the EU level. The article identifies two crucial factors as the basis of the popular backlash against GDPR in Czechia, the lack of prioritisation and the insufficient bureaucratic capacity. These two factors, widely identified in the literature as factors influencing small states’ performance, contributed to the Czech inability to shape GDPR at the European level, as well as the lacking information campaign and implementation domestically.","[{""name"": ""Lucie Kadlecová"", ""affiliation"": [""Charles University, Czechia""]}, {""name"": ""Tomáš Weiss"", ""affiliation"": [""Charles University, Czechia""]}]","[""10.1111/1468-5965.00260"", ""10.1057/9780230246911_2"", ""10.1080/23340460.2017.1410721"", ""10.1080/13501760701702272"", ""10.1111/1468-5965.00351"", ""10.1057/9780230234345"", ""10.1080/01402382.2018.1510195"", ""10.1080/21599165.2016.1221817"", ""10.1080/02684527.2014.988444"", ""10.1177/0010836711406417"", ""10.1080/13501760010014902"", ""10.54648/BULA1992101"", ""10.1109/NaNA.2019.00008"", ""10.1057/palgrave.cep.6110023"", ""10.1515/9781685853372"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2008.01833.x"", ""10.1017/eis.2017.20"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2010.00108.x"", ""10.1080/09557571.2016.1242556"", ""10.1017/S0143814X10000152"", ""10.1023/A:1008603019881"", ""10.1080/13501763.2011.544490"", ""10.30950/jcer.v6i2.264"", ""10.1080/09557571.2012.710579"", ""10.1080/09557571.2012.710590"", ""10.1177/0952076715581540"", ""10.1080/13533312.2014.938580"", ""10.1080/13501763.2012.662072"", ""10.1080/09557570802253435"", ""10.1162/002081800551109"", ""10.1080/1570585018458754"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2008.00798.x"", ""10.1016/S1353-4858(16)30056-3"", ""10.1080/09557570601003502"", ""10.4324/9781315798042-1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Though banned earlier, by 1908, Ibsen’s text had already been played all over Europe. Between 1880 and 1908, the search of IbsenStage indicates 402 records, but probably the actual performance number was higher. The popularity of the text can be seen in the fact that all the independent theatres staged it, and most of the famous and less famous travelling companies and travelling stars also kept it in their repertoires. Though, usually, the high-artistic independent and the commercial international and regional travelling companies are treated separately, here, I argue for their close real and/or virtual interconnections, creating such a theatrical and cultural network, in which the local, the regional, the national, and the transnational interacted with and were influenced by each other. At the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, such interaction among different forces and agents on different levels was one of the special features of cultural mobility (Greenblatt) which characterized intercultural theatre culture, existing in Europe and America, and extending its influence almost all over the globe.","[{""name"": ""Zoltán Imre"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

James Fenimore Cooper’s Leatherstocking Tales and Honoré de Balzac’s La Comédie humaine are proposed as significant precursors that embody two dominant trends within recurring character storytelling: the central protagonist series and the populous storyworld. The foundations of recurring character storytelling are traced in a range of determinants including: increasing literacy and the rise of popular genres; modes of serial publication; and the development and enforcement of copyright law. Finally, focusing upon the central protagonist variant, the age and aging of recurring characters are discussed as a necessary consideration for the makers and adapters of such series. Several are analysed, including James Bond, Sharpe, the Morse franchise, and Midsomer Murders, to illuminate how makers handle chronology, the passage of time, and related issues in adaptation. As part of an assessment of the ‘affordances’ of recurring character fictions, nostalgia and familiarity are discussed as significant dimensions of the experience they furnish.","[{""name"": ""Jeremy Strong"", ""affiliation"": [""University of West London, London School of Film, Media and Design""]}]","[""10.2307/2926130"", ""10.1177/1741659012451985"", ""10.9783/9780812201437"", ""10.2307/j.ctv36xvrdr.7"", ""10.4324/9780203449769"", ""10.1515/9783110232424"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300108057.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781118312032.ch3"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.4324/9780203807125"", ""10.1177/0267323108101830"", ""10.1515/9783110232424.6.527"", ""10.1002/9781118312032.ch18"", ""10.1515/9783110232424.5.459""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

It sets the scene with a visit to the Curtain Tree in the rainforests of north Queensland, Australia, arguing that the vitality and display of its root system models a special kind of reciprocity between the performative elements of the environment and the environmental elements of theatre and performance.

In the past five years, however, the industry has been transformed by a rising demand for high-end drama series. In addition to the positive developments for the economic stability of production companies, challenges are unfolding as the demand for new content keeps growing. This article introduces three recent and central developments, drawing on interviews with four local producers and an analysis of industry and media reports. First, new players have entered the market and introduced new financing opportunities, both domestic and international. Second, international co-production opportunities have grown through production companies’ new international focus. And finally, the introduction of the Finnish production incentive for the audio-visual industry has enabled more ambitious projects. These developments have led to two main challenges that the industry is currently facing: the imminent lack of experienced crew and the need for revised practices for screenwriting, development and production.","[{""name"": ""Heidi Grundström"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000108389418 Aalto University""]}, {""name"": ""Jose Juan Cañas Bajo"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000108389418 Aalto University""]}, {""name"": ""Ilkka Matila"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000108389418 Aalto University""]}]","[""10.1057/9781137356888_11"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1093/screen/31.1.67"", ""10.1386/jptv.4.1.91_1"", ""10.1177/0163443716682076"", ""10.1002/9781118475300.ch20"", ""10.1386/jsca_00017_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Urban Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Men and women clad in white mundu teemed about the busy street buying oil and salt, horseshoes and iron farm implements, coarse cloth, coir rope, jaggery, and palm toddy. The men were mostly bare-chested, though some, unmindful of the sweltering heat, wore white long shirts or an upper-body cloth. While a few young women wore printed blouses, many, particularly the older women, wore no upper-body clothes except for large, beaded necklaces made of red-colored stones. Most people, with the exception of the men who clothed their upper body, walked along the sides of the road, leaving the path clear for the occasional bullock cart. These bullock carts, also known as villuvandi, carried young men-about-town, almost exclusively landowning, upper-caste Nairs. Dressed in a spotless white shirt, white mundu, and matching white turban, the Nair riding his villuvandi assumed the haughty air of a master surveying his subjects; out to observe his inferiors as much as be seen as a superior. These Nairs, and other upper-caste men and women, had the exclusive right of way, on bullock cart or on foot, the right to wear clean white clothes, and, of course, the right to ride a villuvandi. These rights were codified through caste-based rules or norms known as jati maryada, which governed all aspects of social behavior.","[{""name"": ""Vivek V.

We evaluate the extent to which the latter messages reinforced or undermined official narratives; the relative trust that each set of messages is generating among citizens; the implications for effective management of the crisis; and steps that the state took to maintain/regain control as it sought to combat what it considered to be (dis)misinformation from some of these sources.","[{""name"": ""Kwame Akuffo Anoff-Ntow"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121572938 University of Toronto Scarborough""]}, {""name"": ""Wisdom J.

10.1386/jams_00018_1,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN MEDIA STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0503 Journalism and Communication; 0303 Sociology,CCTV in Africa: Constructive approach to manufacturing consent,"China Central Television (CCTV) launched its first media centre in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2012 and is one of the main actors in the ‘China’s media go global’ campaign. CCTV-Africa’s reporting style has previously been engaged by media practitioners and academics in terms of its discursive practices. In 2014, a new paradigm studying the journalistic practice of Chinese media in Africa emerged. It has been argued that the journalistic approach deployed by Chinese media in Africa, especially CCTV-Africa, is more constructive than simply positive. This article aims to provide a structural analysis on the role of international news in mediating and reinforcing the ‘harmony of interest’ of transnational elite groups with empirical findings from the case study of CCTV-Africa and its constructive approach of journalism. The findings of this research show that the ‘constructiveness’ of CCTV-Africa is marked with the ‘non-interference’ diplomatic strategy of China in Africa which minimalizes the political involvement of China in local conflicts by reducing investigation on causes and emphasizing solutions. Simultaneously, it also produces an apolitical context which encourages economic development in African societies to cater to the grander politics of China in Africa.","[{""name"": ""Yu Xiang"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123235732 Shanghai University""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaoxing Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419367494 Simon Fraser University""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01304.x"", ""10.1177/1742766508101318"", ""10.1080/02560054.2013.834835"", ""10.1177/002234337100800201"", ""10.1080/01296612.2003.11726720"", ""10.5089/9781451972061.003"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00384.x"", ""10.1353/wp.1996.0013"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2000.tb02843.x"", ""10.1111/j.1943-0787.2009.01149.x"", ""10.1007/BF00161293"", ""10.1080/14649370600983303"", ""10.1080/01292986.2019.1606263"", ""10.1386/jams_00018_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Development', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Despite the fact that these entertainment stories are characterized by a love line between male characters, the authors and consumers of Chinese BL are primarily heterosexual women. Danmei has become popular not only in China itself, but also in many other countries, which adds relevance to the study of its reception by the Russian audience. First of all, this applies to web series television adaptations of network BL novels available to the world audience. The research focuses on a number of issues related to the production, adaptation, and consumption of danmei media content. What are the features of the genre and how does it differ from non-Chinese versions of BL? What makes danmei so attractive for women and how is the Chinese BL community structured? What strategies does the Chinese web series industry use to adapt primary sources and how do BL fans and a wider audience perceive these adaptations? The article shows the contradictions inherent in the danmei subculture: on the one hand, its proximity to the feminist and queer movements, on the other—its support for heteropatriarchal values. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the representative strategy of bromance used by Chinese producers in the TV adaptations of danmei novels under party-state censorship. In particular, I analyze the popular TV series S.C.I. Mystery (2018), Guardian (2018), The Untamed (2019), and Word of Honor (2021). Apart from de-erotizing the interactions of between the protagonists, these adaptations significantly modify the genre, plot, setting, and characters. At the same time, producers of the shows take into account the expectations of the multimillion army of danmei fans, leaving them certain opportunities for queer reading. In Russia, danmei by the web novelist Mo Xiang Tong Xiu are the most popular, as well as the fantasy web series The Untamed based on her novel Mo Dao Zu Shi. This case study of the multi-part online drama The Untamed reveal the three patterns of reception of the series by the Russian audience: bromantic, romantic and “fluid.” In conclusion, the challenges of conceptualizing danmei as a genre, subculture, and entertainment industry have been articulated.","[{""name"": ""EVGENIYA G.

TheBridging Musical Worldsproject was conducted in 2016 during a period of extraordinary global migration. In Australia, children and young people of South Sudanese heritage occupy a prominent place in emerging communities in many large urban areas but are often subject to discriminatory discourse. The project enabled SCM music education students to engage in reciprocal teaching and learning opportunities relating to South Sudanese music and culture and globalised popular music. In this chapter we outline the major outcomes of the project, including social inclusion through collaborative participatory music making, and explore the impact of these musical activities on the development of cultural competence and intercultural understanding for tertiary students.","[{""name"": ""Kathryn Marsh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Catherine Ingram"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Samantha Dieckmann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1321103X16667863"", ""10.1080/14613808.2013.781145"", ""10.4324/9781315693699"", ""10.1177/1057083712471198"", ""10.1386/ijcm.3.2.303_7"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1nq3d9"", ""10.4135/9781452230153"", ""10.1177/1028315306287002"", ""10.1177/0255761405050930"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199777839.001.0001"", ""10.1386/ijcm.3.2.291_1"", ""10.1080/14613800903390758"", ""10.1177/1321103X13508057"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2015.03.018"", ""10.1108/JME-12-2014-0042"", ""10.1080/07256860903003575"", ""10.1177/1321103X12466138"", ""10.1080/14613808.2016.1189525"", ""10.1177/0022487110381998"", ""10.1177/0255761405058238"", ""10.1017/S0265051700003077"", ""10.1177/1321103X15590698"", ""10.18848/978-1-86335-626-8/CGP""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Music', 'Education', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Although Shaw neither wrote about pandemics nor used the word “epidemic” in his plays, he wrote of epidemics in his prefaces, essays, and letters to editors and individuals. Having contracted smallpox, it concerned him personally and as a vestryman of St. Pancras with the smallpox epidemic of 1901–2, which he tried to prevent. Rejecting vaccinations and revaccinations, he allied himself with Florence Nightingale's methods of cleanliness and sanitation, both of which medical experts now urge to help prevent the spread of coronavirus, whose transmission, incubation period, and prevention have similarities to those of smallpox.","[{""name"": ""Bernard F.

10.3366/film.2020.0135,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,Bad Faith in Film Spectatorship,"This article seeks to develop an under-appreciated aspect of spectator activity: the way in which viewers make use of film to enter or sustain a project of bad faith. Based on Jean-Paul Sartre's account of bad faith in Being and Nothingness (1943), the article explains the aspects of bad faith that are pertinent to viewer activity, then explores the way viewers can make use of filmic depictions to facilitate self-denial. For example, spectators may emphasize the fact that persons are depicted in narrow terms as corroboration for their belief that human nature is just as its depicted, thereby denying that we have the freedom to be otherwise. Or spectators may deny the relevance of problematic aspects of themselves when they find it depicted in characters who are admirable in other ways. I then consider whether films themselves can be described as being in bad faith. While technically they cannot, I identify ways that a film may encourage or discourage bad faith in viewers. I also examine how the immersive aspect of film enables viewers to turn attention away from themselves while they engage in self-denial. The case for this approach to viewer activity and film analysis is supplemented by a distinction between traits that do apply to film, e.g., being racist, sexist, or homophobic, and the resources it gives persons to be in bad faith about these social attitudes. I argue that a film can have traits like these while not encouraging bad faith and vice versa, demonstrating the unique perspective offered by approaching film and spectator activity in terms of bad faith.","[{""name"": ""William Pamerleau"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg""]}]","[""10.2307/j.ctt7snkj.11"", ""10.7312/carr92070"", ""10.1057/9781137283740"", ""10.5040/9781472547484"", ""10.1353/mln.0.0157"", ""10.1017/S0031819100049755"", ""10.1525/9780520943919"", ""10.5040/9781501302978"", ""10.1017/S0031819100068741"", ""10.1353/nlh.2016.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Philosophy', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

The results indicate that it is not the overall level of arousal that is likely to affect these factors, but instead a specific pattern of arousal that allows variation and build-up to memorable scenes. Based on the analysis of four drama film trailers, we suggest that a two-peak structure provides an optimal arousal curve.","[{""name"": ""Morten Thomsen"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107280170 University of Southern Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Lene Heiselberg"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107280170 University of Southern Denmark""]}]","[""10.1080/15213269.2012.693811"", ""10.1080/08838151.2011.620668"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2012.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.biopsycho.2008.03.004"", ""10.1386/jgvw.3.3.181_1"", ""10.1080/08838159909364504"", ""10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199862139.003.0009"", ""10.1515/9789048515059-014"", ""10.1177/000276488031003005"", ""10.1386/jsca_00013_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Marketing']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

This article investigates the interpersonal competencies and emotional skills of the artist who uses puppets in their practice in health-care contexts and settings. We present initial findings from phase B of a wider longitudinal study. Phase A focused on actors in hospitals and drama trainees; Phase B uses qualitative research methods with actors, puppeteers and therapists as participants. Content analysis of data reveals that the main competencies the artist needs to deal with emotional incidents in health care are empathy, self- and social awareness, self-care, self-reflection, emotional resilience and active listening. These skills are needed alongside acting and puppetry skills to develop competent and professional artists in healthcare. The study offers evidence to further develop strategies of receiving, processing and communicating emotions safely and effectively within the protection of the artform. This study therefore diverts our attention from traditional training courses that are mainly about learning artistic skills to a cross-disciplinary pedagogical framework that aims to enable artists to observe, reflect and process emotions before, during and after a performance with patients as theatre ‘audience’-participants.","[{""name"": ""Persephone Sextou"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000093549756 Newman University Birmingham, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Anatoli Karypidou"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000093549756 Newman University Birmingham, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Eleni Kourtidou-Sextou"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000095066213 NHS, UK""]}]","[""10.1080/15524250802353934"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1300/J010v41n01_05"", ""10.1097/01.ACM.0000259374.52323.62"", ""10.1080/02615479.2011.586566"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04340.x"", ""10.11120/hsce.2014.00040"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2011.04188.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04412.x"", ""10.1386/atr_00006_1"", ""10.1386/atr.4.3.255_1"", ""10.1093/fampra/13.6.522"", ""10.1017/S0954579407000442"", ""10.1016/j.shaw.2014.05.004"", ""10.1080/13569783.2013.810929"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2007.02797.x"", ""10.2190/DUGG-P24E-52WK-6CDG"", ""10.1080/01421590701509647"", ""10.1386/atr.6.2.107_1"", ""10.1002/smi.979"", ""10.1177/1098214005283748"", ""10.1017/S0959259810000420"", ""10.25164/cnr201701003"", ""10.1386/atr_00028_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Medicine']","['Conservation', 'Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"
10.3138/ctr.181.002,CANADIAN THEATRE REVIEW,1303 Drama Film and Television,Applied Theatre and Education: We Are Not-Yet ...,"In this article, we consider the relationship between education and applied theatre, the growth of applied theatre curricula within Canada, the issues that presently we identify as ‘productive tensions,’ and political and social concerns that now frame the ways in which we shape and conduct our practice. Our thoughts and suggestions, while limited by those constraints we offered above, may serve to open a space for discussion on what is and what might be. In our view—looking back over two decades of development in the field of applied theatre programs in Canada—there are a number of tensions that have come into clearer focus as applied theatre has been finding its feet. We see these tensions as productive and offer them not as criticisms but as opportunities to reconsider methodologies in light of a post-dramatic world. Applied theatre programs tend to operate in theatre departments that mostly focus on training for independent careers in text-based mainstream theatre. Such an intention may make it difficult for some who see theatre as a path to careers different from performance and/or production. Certainly, the recent addition of applied theatre to university curricula has revealed some interesting pressures. The division between the hierarchical traditions of theatremaking, with the top-down approach of director-designer-actor-audience, may be beginning to shift with the advent of new thinking. The ways of working that are integral approaches to applied theatremaking require a broader interdisciplinarity of courses than those traditionally offered in departments of theatre.","[{""name"": ""Monica Prendergast"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juliana Saxton"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1147/sj.393.0768"", ""10.1007/s10780-016-9298-2"", ""10.3998/mpub.119520"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107587977"", ""10.4324/9780203088104"", ""10.1080/13569783.2013.872432"", ""10.1080/13569783.2015.1059747"", ""10.4324/9780203361887"", ""10.1057/9780230242425""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

10.1017/S0266464X20000652,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Ajax in America, or Catharsis in the Time of Terrorism","Originally funded by the US Department of Defense in 2009, Theater of War Productions’ first project, Theater of War, performs dramatic readings of Ajax at military bases, hospitals, and academic institutions throughout the United States. Developed by Bryan Doerries, Theater of War brings awareness to the epidemic of suicide and other forms of violence committed by American military service members in the wake of the United States’ so-called ‘war on terror’. But like Ajax, American military personnel typically turn to violence only after being betrayed by the institutions that they served. This article follows how Ajax’s more modern manifestation disrupts the tragic protagonist’s status as a sacrificial victim whose death precipitates tragedy’s cathartic effect, and challenges what René Girard calls the ‘scapegoat mechanism’ and its socio-political function. It argues that Ajax’s appearance as a cathartic figure in American society provokes spectators and artists to reckon with the conditions that can cause military personnel to act violently, and inspires protests against broader hegemonic socio-political structures and the military culture that sustains them.

It argues that the adaptation offers a recognizable transposition of Gaskell’s text, but makes some significant adjustments that reveal its contemporary reimagining of the novel’s gender and racial politics. In particular, Davies transforms Gaskell’s unexceptional female protagonist Molly Gibson into a proto-feminist naturalist adventurer, and revisions the casual racism the novel expresses towards black people in line with late-twentieth-century sensibilities. Each text, novel and film, reveals the period-specific ideological forces that shape its portrayal of Englishwomen and African people.","[{""name"": ""Gill Ballinger"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Creative and Cultural Industries, University of the West of England, UK""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139164702.010"", ""10.1017/S1060150305000744"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521849624"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521849624.017"", ""10.5325/victinstj.35.1.0007"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139566384.003"", ""10.1057/9781403937513"", ""10.1093/screen/23.1.6"", ""10.1093/res/55.222.727"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apn024"", ""10.1016/S0039-3681(02)00015-8"", ""10.1353/vcr.1998.0017"", ""10.56021/9780801851414""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

The conference took place on March 30—April 2, 2021, and was organized by the State Institute for Art Studies, GITR Film and Television School, and the Saint Petersburg State University. SIAS has been hosting conferences on contemporary culture, screen art and television for 17 years. This year, for the first time in the history of such forums, the researchers were tasked with analyzing the new things that machines have brought to the arts and, in general, to human life. The conference took its special place among the forums held over the past year in Russia and abroad in the following areas: artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Journey, Moscow,Russia); machine learning (International Conferenceon Machine Learning, Vienna, Austria; 3rd International Conference on Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence, Hangzhou, China); civilization of knowledge (Civilization of Knowledge: Russian Realities, Moscow, Russia), etc. The novelty of the conference lies in the unification of the seemingly incompatible phenomena: art and machine civilization. As is commonly known, art was traditionally opposed to technology as something alien, sometimes hostile, although the both were born in human mind and created by human hands. Until now, the expression “machine civilization” in art has been used mainly in the genre of fantasy and with an emphasis on its negative connotations. The purpose of the conference was to comprehend the artistic practices in the era of machine civilization, get acquainted with current hypotheses, publish new facts and discuss modern terminologies (law of spontaneity, law of semantic uncertainty, algorithmic apophenia, post-opera, artificial life and new vitality). Along with the study of new challenges, old issues were raised, which became in demand in the machine civilization: originals and copies of artworks, the boundaries of conventionality and overcoming distrust in new media, narratives and poetics in serious and entertaining screen genres. The conference reports were divided into six blocks: Theoretical Models, ScreenArts—Cinema, Fine Arts, Music, PC Games, and Digitalization.","[{""name"": ""YEVGENY V.

McEnany’s and Gadsby’s works have occasioned praise from cosmopolitan gatekeepers like the New York Times and the New Yorker for their self-aware brands of comedy rooted in unvarnished portrayals of butch trauma. Critics ritually insist on the implausibility of Gadsby’s and McEnany’s success, but the popularity of these queer creators’ offerings is not as unlikely as so often presumed. Indeed, the middlebrow butch’s alleged improbability does not render her cultural accolades improbable; it may even ensure them, allowing a new canon of butch respectability to emerge in the light shed by the beacons of aspirational culture.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Kessler"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

How will climate change, one of, if not the most pressing issue of our times be tackled on a global scale? With these questions in mind, this article invites the reader to perform a thought experiment into the future. Following an imagined snapshot of the year 2040, the reader is guided through major global developments regarding climate change, social movements and, eventually, climate justice from the 2020s to 2040s. By imagining social, political and economic consequences of climate change and responses to them, this article paints a picture of what the future could look like if climate justice became a guiding principle in the struggle of mitigating the effects of climate change. Suggesting a paradigm shift from securitizing climate change to securing climate justice, this ‘future’ calls for a discursive turn of the manner in which climate change is thought of and acted upon. It requires different entities, including academia, to recognize their role as political actors within society. Consequently, it is crucial to reflect upon whose security is (not) considered but also which responses are taken into account in what way to mitigate security risks related to climate change. The article concludes that imagining a future of climate justice is pivotal to finding solutions to the challenges we are confronted with, that is, keeping the metaphoric ship from crashing into the cliffs.","[{""name"": ""Madita Standke-Erdmann"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Vienna, Austria""]}, {""name"": ""Alina Viehoff"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg (IFSH), Germany""]}]","[""10.1080/01436597.2017.1375379"", ""10.1038/s41558-018-0068-2"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx048"", ""10.1017/S0892679418000059"", ""10.4324/9781315749228"", ""10.2305/IUCN.CH.2020.03.en"", ""10.1215/9780822375265"", ""10.1057/dev.2011.86"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.09.014"", ""10.4324/9781315537689"", ""10.4324/9781315162935-18"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-19059-1_20"", ""10.1080/21624887.2019.1644050"", ""10.4324/9781315671468-1"", ""10.1590/1809-4422asocex0003v2022017""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

A Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) research sub-committee of the North American Drama Therapy Association (NADTA) was formed and members took on the task of reading full-text available articles listed in the NADTA empirical references list (N= 123) with the aim of identifying representations of race within the research through a content analysis. Our team found limited examples of both author-identified race information and contextualized participant racial demographics. When race was presented, most often as descriptive statistics alone, contextual information about culture or other relevant supportive literature was often lacking. Further research and a more systematic critical review of existing drama therapy empirical studies are needed to formulate recommendations for addressing racial disparities within drama therapy research.","[{""name"": ""Erica Laikah Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Scholar""]}, {""name"": ""Mary Elizabeth Morris"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Scholar""]}, {""name"": ""Chyela Rowe"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000092155771 Lesley University""]}, {""name"": ""Michelle Moreno"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Scholar""]}, {""name"": ""Jonathan Navarro"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000103132234 Antioch University Seattle""]}]","[""10.1080/02630672.2013.773132"", ""10.1386/dtr_00002_1"", ""10.1386/dtr.2.1.41_1"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2011.04.004"", ""10.1177/0263067219843442"", ""10.2307/1289308"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2004.09.001"", ""10.1080/02630672.2015.1055778"", ""10.1038/d41586-022-00426-7"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2012.12.003"", ""10.1386/dtr.4.2.271_1"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2013.301706"", ""10.1080/07421656.2015.1060835"", ""10.1111/camh.12271"", ""10.1038/s41575-020-0349-x"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2013.05.007"", ""10.1080/12259276.2010.11666088"", ""10.1386/dtr.2.1.79_1"", ""10.1007/s10465-019-09315-5"", ""10.1037/cdp0000514"", ""10.1386/dtr_00005_1"", ""10.1177/0149206317743553"", ""10.1016/S0197-4556(97)00015-4"", ""10.1016/0197-4556(87)90037-2"", ""10.1080/02630672.2018.1432668"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2011.12.008"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2008.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2011.09.002"", ""10.1177/0169796X19880417"", ""10.1080/15401383.2014.935546"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2013.06.003"", ""10.1111/j.1475-3588.2011.00629.x"", ""10.1177/1359104507078477"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2004.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2011.12.009"", ""10.1386/dtr.2.2.195_1"", ""10.1353/hpu.0.0323"", ""10.1386/dtr.1.2.201_1"", ""10.1126/science.abf2170"", ""10.1386/dtr.2.1.9_1"", ""10.1386/dtr.4.2.223_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00025_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00119_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['Conservation', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.7227/FS.22.0003,FILM STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,A Queer Tension: The Difficult Comedy of Hannah Gadsby: Nanette,"This article concerns itself with feminist comedy that is deemed angry and difficult in an era of postfeminism. Hannah Gadsby’s live show Nanette, released as a Netflix film, can be described as difficult because it is politically challenging, emotionally demanding and disrupts the established format of stand-up comedy. Yet it has had critical and commercial success. Nanette challenges the underpinning assumption of postfeminism: that feminism is no longer needed. It is feminist and angry. To explore the phenomenon of angry feminist comedy in the postfeminist era, the article considers the comedy of Gadsby through the figure of the feminist killjoy, coined by Sara Ahmed, to reflect how the killjoy and the queer art of failing offer forms of political ‘sabotage’ that subvert comedy as masculinist popular culture.","[{""name"": ""Olu Jenzen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Brighton""]}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Psychology', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Gender Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

Thanks to the regulation of breathing patterns, patterns in our thinking are not just affected but revealed, together with their entanglement with respiration (in a variety of looping effects here considered as ‘biocognitive feedback’). What makes this reciprocal feedback possible is the structural intimacy and co-dependency of breath and consciousness—a dyadic and dynamic relationship already conceptualised by William James, and today reappraised by contemporary, Buddhist-inspired cognitive sciences. Critically integrating psychological, cognitive, phenomenological, and narratological frameworks, this essay investigates the co-dependent intimacy between breath and cognition as represented, explored, and complicated in the narrative work of Samuel Beckett.","[{""name"": ""Marco Bernini"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9780230800540"", ""10.3366/E0309520709000053"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7414.001.0001"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00973"", ""10.1057/9781137307255""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Focusing on the limited series, Super Pumped and WeCrashed, which are about Uber and WeWork, the authors analyze how relations of race, class, and gender/sexuality emerge in these narrativized techworlds via several “figures,” including white male founders/CEOs or “millennial messiahs,” “female fixers” that range from executives to silent service providers, and the “corporate board.” These figures are important because they circulate across fictional and non-fictional contexts and become a means by which publics make sense of the power relations of tech startups. Even as these shows center on the trials and tribulations of egomaniacal, power-hungry CEOs, they raise crucial questions about corporate corruption, gender/racial discrimination, and labor exploitation in the tech workplace and challenge viewers to reckon with the unchecked power of the big US technology companies.","[{""name"": ""Lisa Parks"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""France Winddance Twine"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Gender Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

The film is centred upon a 30-year-old ‘leftover woman’ Sheng Nan’s distressful life experiences and her anger at the prevailing sexism and ageism. Rather than being tamed or domesticated, throughout the film the angry and restless woman is shown to be constantly on the motion, making every effort to experiment with alternative looking relations that seek to destroy the voyeuristic pleasure and disciplinary power of the privileged male gaze, as well as to explore possibilities of creating a self-reflective and critical female gaze. A contextualized critical study of the female authorship and agency on and behind the screen will shed new light on how contemporary Chinese women filmmakers take on ‘concrete and various negotiations’ with the structure of domination and its representational system via ‘their socially and politically conditioned cinematic practice or performance’.","[{""name"": ""Hui Faye Xiao"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121060692 University of Kansas""]}]","[""10.1386/ac_00040_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Our sample was selected from the attendees at the first-ever Christmas Con in 2019, sponsored, in part, by Hallmark. Participants in the study self-identified as true Hallmark Christmas movie fans who were then asked to sort through a group of statements based on the question: ‘Why I love Hallmark Christmas movies?’ The results revealed three factors or groups of like-minded thinkers, the Season’s Greeters, who are the Christmas enthusiasts who watch the movies as a way to celebrate the season; the Rudolphs, who watch to escape the troubles of the world and their busy lives and the Carolers, who watch simply for a wholesome story with happy endings.","[{""name"": ""Tom Robinson"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369115 Brigham Young University""]}, {""name"": ""Scott Haden Church"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369115 Brigham Young University""]}, {""name"": ""Loy Clark Callahan"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369115 Brigham Young University""]}, {""name"": ""Lucia Pollock"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369115 Brigham Young University""]}, {""name"": ""Lauren Silva"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369115 Brigham Young University""]}]","[""10.1177/1350508411416400"", ""10.1386/jsca.3.3.195_1"", ""10.1037/h0099281"", ""10.1080/01494929.2015.1061629"", ""10.1007/BF02769102"", ""10.1080/03637751.2013.776697"", ""10.1080/01463370903113632"", ""10.1080/07491401003669984"", ""10.1023/A:1021516410457"", ""10.3138/jrpc.26.1.1"", ""10.1037/ppm0000034"", ""10.1111/j.1467-954X.2012.02138.x"", ""10.1007/s12119-011-9092-3"", ""10.1080/15205436.2011.618900"", ""10.1080/17482798.2020.1711787"", ""10.1177/0001699316659321"", ""10.1037/ppm0000175"", ""10.1177/0014524609348814"", ""10.1386/jptv_00084_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Communication', 'Gender Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

Alexander Walker identifies United Artists and Universal Pictures as two of the major players in the trend he dubbed ‘Hollywood England’. This article offers a close examination of the role of two studios in the financing of British film production by making extensive use of the Film Finances Archive. It focuses on two case studies: Tom Jones (1963) and Isadora (1968), both of which had completion guarantees from Film Finances, and will argue that Tony Richardson and Karel Reisz, two of the key British New Wave directors, lost their previous ability to direct films to budget and within schedule when they had the financial resources of American studios behind them. It will analyse how, due to a combination of ‘artistic’ intent and Hollywood money, Richardson and Reisz separately created two of the most notorious ‘runaways’ that ran away during the 1960s.","[{""name"": ""Llewella Chapman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01439685.2014.879001"", ""10.1080/01439685.2014.878999"", ""10.1080/01439685.2014.879002"", ""10.1080/01439685.2015.1129708"", ""10.1080/01439685.2017.1285150"", ""10.1080/01439685.2014.879000"", ""10.3366/E174345210900065X""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1386/atr_00023_1,APPLIED THEATRE RESEARCH,1303 Drama Film and Television,'Objects with Objectives': Applied puppetry from practice into theory,"This article draws on the dialogue between puppetry and applied drama that arose from the AHRC Objects with Objectives Research Network in 2017–18 to explore a tentative theory of applied puppetry. A range of theoretical approaches to applied drama are examined in the light of practical examples of applied puppetry using case studies from Northern Ireland, South Africa and Australia. Morton (2013) highlights how, in performance ‘tension between the material puppet and the imagined puppet’ gives rise to a kind of ‘double vision’ (Tillis 1992), a concept that the article considers alongside Gallagher’s (2005) distinction between body image and body schema, Brecht’s (1974) V-effekt, Meyerhold’s (1998) distinction between the materiality and agency of the actor and Boal’s (1992) idea of metaxis. The article concludes that the distancing and conductive qualities of applied puppetry often work in parallel and that the puppet can be seen as the site of metaxis when used in an applied context.","[{""name"": ""David Grant"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000403747521 Queen’s University, Belfast, UK""]}]","[""10.1017/S0266464X08000481"", ""10.1386/atr_00023_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Music']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

The article analyses the ‘feeling tones’ of the letters that describe both Craigie's attempts to get the film made and her difficulties in distributing it. It is argued that paying attention to these affective aspects of the archive and the film together enables a recalibration of (in a variant of Raymond Williams's formulation) the structure of feminist feeling in both the film and, to an extent, the wider public realm in the immediate post-war period.

This article explores the wartime evolution of this idea by expanding on the Ministry of Information's (MoI) organisation of mobile film shows in practice: uncovering archival evidence of Helen de Mouilpied's work organising the regional film exhibition scheme, and focusing on the programming of film shows for women, including those held on a regular basis for the Women's Institute (WI) in the ephemeral spaces of village halls. By taking into consideration records of de Mouilpied's distribution work at the Ministry and the often insubstantial, fragmentary and regional traces of film shows in Ministry records, the local press and the WI journal Home &amp; Country, this article offers a new view of the non-theatrical operation's role as ‘useful cinema’ in the MoI Films Division's propaganda programme, and its encouragement of a civic film culture on the home front that has been overshadowed in histories of British documentary and wartime cinema.","[{""name"": ""Hollie Price"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/9780822394167"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-92496-7_2"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719086076.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230392878"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2021.0592"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-05893-8_11"", ""10.1080/01439680500236151"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66344-9"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2021.0591"", ""10.7765/9781526133137.00008"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-92441-7""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1386/jptv_00010_1,JOURNAL OF POPULAR TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,'Half the world away': Cultural distance and intertextual incompetence in the American reception of British TV comedy,"Comedy has long been thought of as a genre that does not ‘travel’ well, owing to the fact that humour is often tied to culturally specific (or ‘local’) references that might be lost on audiences outside a text’s originating context. In recent years, however, a few globally recognized comedians, such as Simon Pegg, have suggested that the jokes that pepper British comedies can be easily understood by non-British audiences. This article critically interrogates both premises and questions whether the intertextual incompetence of viewers might exacerbate feelings of literal and figurative distance while solidifying an insider/outsider binary that resembles the inclusionary and exclusionary rhetoric at the heart of nationalistic discourse. Drawing upon the insights of comedy and language theorists, the author adopts an autoethnographic approach that foregrounds his own (frequently failed) attempts to disentangle culturally specific references in British sitcoms. Such an approach reveals how, to varying degrees, class, distinction and the cultural capital or taste presumably needed to discern the value and meaning of something all impinge on the connective yet distancing act of transnational TV spectatorship.","[{""name"": ""David Scott Diffrient"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368083 Colorado State University""]}]","[""10.3366/E1743452109001137"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190663124.003.0011"", ""10.1080/09502389000490061"", ""10.1007/s12119-013-9188-z"", ""10.1386/jptv_00010_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Gender Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

In health care, mannequins play the role of simulated patients. Most often, they simply stand in for the body of the patient. However, this misses the potential that the materiality of these objects holds when considered through applied puppetry terms. This article examines examples of puppetry used in simulated role-play (SRP) for training and assessment, including a specific project involving applied puppetry with person-centred nursing (PCN) students at Ulster University (UU). It attempts to theorize how, when used in this way, applied puppetry is a metaphorical and translational act of anthropomorphism – a process by which an object can ‘become’ more than a thing. In this context, we seek to define a practice in which a mannequin fulfils its potential as a puppet-patient in SRP for PCN students.","[{""name"": ""Karl Tizzard-Kleister"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000105519715 Ulster University, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Matt Jennings"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000105519715 Ulster University, UK""]}]","[""10.1386/atr.6.2.89_1"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2017.09.007"", ""10.1086/345321"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2016.12.008"", ""10.1016/j.ecns.2015.09.002"", ""10.1177/1746847716661456"", ""10.1016/j.ecns.2008.09.004"", ""10.4103/0974-2700.70743"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2013.04.010"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2013.06.015"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2014.04.004"", ""10.1016/j.ecns.2016.09.013"", ""10.1016/j.colegn.2016.09.005"", ""10.7146/rom.v1i1.15849"", ""10.1080/13569783.2015.1073581"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2016.12.001"", ""10.3828/jlcds.2017.15"", ""10.3366/dls.2016.0210"", ""10.1111/edth.12078"", ""10.1386/atr_00027_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Medicine']","['Cultural Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Psychiatry and Mental health']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)]]"

The analysis focuses on Dear Evan Hansen (2016) as a musical that depicts emotionally vulnerable teenagers and exploitative online communication, notions that are also often reflected in how fans interact with the show. Fan-generated content is regularly recycled as marketing material, and even as merchandise, that is used to sell the production. Similarly, the musical’s producers and marketing team frequently invite interaction around the musical’s core mantra, ‘You Will Be Found’. These interactions can benefit fans by potentially eliciting feelings of social inclusion that may be experienced as empowering. However, this practice can also be interpreted as equally as ethically dubious as some of the musical’s narrative content, given that fans are ultimately providing free advertising for a commercial musical.","[{""name"": ""Adam Rush"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000094222878 University of Winchester""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-64876-7_10"", ""10.1386/smt.11.3.233_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64876-7_2"", ""10.1037/abn0000410"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64876-7_15"", ""10.1386/smt_00063_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

First, as a document that tracks Robertson’s weight loss, a form of labor that she presents in a register of repetitious drudgery that inevitably ends in failure. Close readings of Robertson’s engagement with diet and exercise are considered within the larger genealogy of women presenting their bodies for measurement in second-wave feminist art. This form of gendered labor is in stark contrast to the second important form found in Five Year Diary, that of work located in the domestic realm. Presented in a decidedly different register of repetition, one rooted in joy, Robertson’s time-lapse and stop-motion sequences record her efforts at cooking and cleaning, relying on time-lapse’s transformative quality to use domestic labor as a form of world-making. At odds with the way the domestic realm is presented by the women’s movement as what keeps women captive in a never-ending cycle of repetitive, meaningless work, the essay argues that Robertson records her domestic labor as not just a means to an end but an aesthetic object in itself.","[{""name"": ""Anjo-marí Gouws"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Urban Studies', 'Gender Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

The project formed part of a wider scheme of practice as research that explored youth theatre practice as political engagement for young people. Legislative Theatre practice was utilized to work alongside the Youth Parliament’s Make Your Mark scheme, an annual poll for young people to decide on campaigning issues. In this article, I consider three elements: tokenism in youth engagement, differing experiences between artistic process and product, and applied theatre’s inability to develop long-term effects. Employing the critical theories of Paulo Freire, the article regards the practice as a failed attempt to develop critical youth theatre practice. I argue that the Legislative Theatre project led to uncritical engagement and no political change due to partner organizations regarding the theatre practice as a service to satisfy their own targets and requirements.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Elliott"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13569780903072125"", ""10.1017/S0266464X00013919"", ""10.1080/13569780600670718"", ""10.1080/10286630500411242"", ""10.1080/13569780701560388"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.00544"", ""10.1177/1369148117728666"", ""10.1093/pa/gsm035"", ""10.1080/135697800114249"", ""10.1386/atr_00049_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Safety Research']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

More than ten years separate these two works. The Fields of Yuréghir was written during Güney’s imprisonment from 1960 to 1963, a period marked by the military coup of 27 May 1960, which lasted until 1961 and a series of coalition governments from 1961 to 1965 under the premiership of İsmet İnönü (1884-1973) of the Republican Party. Arkadaş was filmed in 1974 against the backdrop of the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus in August 1974, a time of great patriotic fervour under the charismatic and left-leaning premiership of Bülent Ecevit (1925-2006). Güney had by then experienced considerable success as a filmmaker and actor. Arkadaş is a product of this favourable constellation of circumstances, both political and personal, that marked this brief period that was abruptly ended by his imprisonment in September 1974. The article is divided into the following sections: a short biography of Yilmaz Güney; a summary of The Fields of Yuréghir and Arkadaş; a thematic analysis of the two works under the headings of political engagement, sexual mores, religion, and national identity; and a conclusion.","[{""name"": ""Stephen Carruthers"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The hope is that prioritizing the embodiment of sound in the creation and writing process will facilitate practitioners’ and audience members’ ability to experience this new play, What We Deserve (an excerpt of which is included in this article), on stage and the page, not only as an interrogation of systems of oppression but also as an expression of a worldview that centres justice.","[{""name"": ""Naila Keleta-Mae"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780203723647""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Posthumanism pays special attention to the development of these approaches. Popular cinema, with its deployed representations of plots and sensitive reaction to cultural trends, successfully constructs such subjectivity by making women the main characters more and more often. The study analyzes on what grounds a female protagonist of contemporary fantastic films, integrated in the new types of communication, acts as an actual posthumanist subject. The term woman Other refers to a woman as a structural Other subject of patriarchal culture, whose otherness and forced marginal position is defined by her belonging to the female gender. The focus on this figure in the study is explained by the fact that posthumanism acknowledges the influence of post-feminist theory on the understanding of the principles of constructing a new subject in modern culture. By rearticulating the function of a woman as Other in Donna Haraway’s concept of a cyborg, we can solve issues inaccessible to earlier poststructuralist feminism and critical Marxism, which, due to their specificity, overlook the problems of preserving subjectivity itself. Earlier posthumanism is overcome by a shift of attention from the growing role of information to the construction of subjectivity within various communication relationships. Philosophical feminism of the late 20th and early 21st century, with its traditional criticism of the subject in the context of poststructuralist foundations, proves necessary for the construction of an actual posthumanistic subject in science fiction films.","[{""name"": ""TATIANA V.

Directed by the Black Zimbabwean Godwin Mawuru, it was the first feminist film in Zimbabwe and in the region, highlighting the plight of women who become the property of their brothers-in-law after their husbands die. The article addresses the issues of the origins of the story and the authorship of the screenplay. On the final reel of the film, the story credit names the accomplished Zimbabwean female novelist, Tsitsi Dangarembga; while the screenplay credit names Louise Riber. Riber served as the film’s White American editor and co-producer who, with her husband John Riber, managed the Media for Development Fund in Zimbabwe. The key question of this article is simple: who wrote the screenplay for Neria? Through the physical and metaphorical journey of this research, we discover that the story is based on the personal experiences of Anna Mawuru, the director’s mother. This is the first time that this fact has surfaced. As such, this article also offers some reflections on issues of adaption/translation, particularly in the context of postcolonial collaborations.","[{""name"": ""Agnieszka Piotrowska"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000098306702 University for the Creative Arts""]}]","[""10.1386/jac.2.2.111_1"", ""10.2307/3178066"", ""10.1080/01439689100260241"", ""10.1080/01956051.1992.10662036"", ""10.1177/0163443705049059"", ""10.1386/josc_00034_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.3366/film.2023.0219,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,"White Material: Ivory tiles, white womanhood, and white supremacy in Jean-Marc Vallee's Sharp Objects","Jean-Marc Vallée’s HBO miniseries, Sharp Objects (2018), follows Camille Preaker (Amy Adams) as she returns to her childhood home in Wind Gap, Missouri, to investigate the murders of two young girls. This article explores a specific type of object related to the systems of violence that reveal themselves over the course of the miniseries: ivory tiles. Here, the ivory tiles affixed to the floor of Camille’s mother’s, Adora Crellin’s (Patricia Clarkson), master bedroom both reveal and influence sinister behaviours of the household’s women. In employing concepts inspired from Thing Theory and Object-Oriented Ontology, as well as critical theory, this article examines how the ivory tiles possess multilayered excesses that constitute an object’s thingness. The foremost excess that informs the ivory tiles’ thingness, I contend, is its relationship to white supremacy. It is not only the tiles’ material history that informs its relationship to white supremacy, but how, through outlining the forms of agency things possess under Thing Theory, the tiles are able to reveal the forms of violence that are structured within the domestic sphere of the Crellin home. A product of violence, the ivory tiles as things speak back to the design of white supremacy.","[{""name"": ""Emily Sanders"", ""affiliation"": [""Queen’s University""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511819582"", ""10.1080/00071773.2016.1139927"", ""10.5840/swjphil198011338"", ""10.1086/449030"", ""10.1086/500700"", ""10.5840/philtoday201256311"", ""10.4324/9780203973431"", ""10.5840/philtoday2016602109"", ""10.1093/cje/bep021"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-56100-0_9"", ""10.1215/9780822382270-006"", ""10.1177/0191453717713809"", ""10.1177/1367549420985852"", ""10.1353/crt.2006.0006"", ""10.3366/jobs.2014.0102""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

The discussion surveys the entirety of the Singapore horror output from the 1990s onwards and draws out a number of key distinctive themes and trends, such as the referencing of Chinese supernatural beliefs and regional Southeast Asian spirits, and also the distinctive preponderance of horror narratives involving military or police. The films are then read in relation to broad tropes of gender, geography and regulation.","[{""name"": ""Adam Knee"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000095631745 Lasalle College of the Arts""]}]","[""10.1386/jcc.6.1.41_1"", ""10.1080/14631369.2011.571834"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9493.2008.00317.x"", ""10.1386/ac.26.2.135_1"", ""10.5790/hongkong/9789622099722.003.0004"", ""10.1093/screen/36.4.371"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-58417-5_11"", ""10.1080/10357821003802037"", ""10.1080/14680777.2010.521624"", ""10.1386/ac_00013_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Using an original, animated video as a stimulus to explore the relationship between anthropomorphism and empathy, the study found that characters with appendages significantly increased viewers’ empathy and use of anthropomorphic language when compared to a character without appendages. This was true regardless of the type of appendage or whether participants labeled the appendage using human anatomy terms. Additionally, participants’ use of anthropomorphic language was significantly linked to empathy. Thus, anthropomorphism and empathy are connected when viewing animated characters, but an explanation of all factors behind these processes is yet to be discovered.","[{""name"": ""Alyssa D.

As a symbol appropriated for various causes, Joan's legacy remains pertinent for the analysis of performative responses to Shaw's portrayal of her life, execution, and “rehabilitation.” Considering the playtext alongside paratextual materials, such as the preface, in light of the mise-en-scène raises the following questions: How can contemporary theater directors and dramaturges honor Shaw's proviso that his play be performed in accordance with his didactic vision while also welcoming their own particular contexts and artistic aims? Is it possible to adhere to all of Shaw's intentions regarding his play? In this way, Mason's production's intersections with and divergences from the source text can serve to elucidate Saint Joan's legacy of performance in Ireland and internationally.","[{""name"": ""Aileen R.

It reflects on the questions that articulate this forum on relational International Relations (IR): what do relational theories of IR offer to the field and add to the debate about IR? What are the promises or limits of relational approaches, and how can or should discussion proceed? I narrate my personal story about exploring and experiencing relationality to offer some reflections and thoughts on these questions which are relevant not only for IR, but to the ways we engage reality. I illustrate the potential of relationality by referring to three dimensions where relationality provides with alternative thinking: the problem of ontological difference; the pluralization and diversification of ways of thinking and being and the engagement with the other than other-than-human. These aspects are some among many others, but they announce opportunities, challenges, tensions, contradictions and possibilities. In the end, the essay reveals not only a transformative experience but a very different approach to water governance providing the reader a general understanding of the alternative thinking derived from relational standpoints and the possibilities it opens to theorize IR and beyond.","[{""name"": ""Amaya Querejazu"", ""affiliation"": [""Aberystwyth University, Aberystwyth, UK"", ""Law and Political Science, University of Antioquia University, Medellin, Colombia""]}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv12101zq"", ""10.33458/uidergisi.985929"", ""10.1177/0305829817702446"", ""10.1177/1474474012462534"", ""10.1215/9780822373780"", ""10.1017/S0892679419000169"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198850885.001.0001"", ""10.1017/s0260210521000450"", ""10.5040/9781474218788"", ""10.1093/isr/viaa100"", ""10.1093/isp/ekaa008"", ""10.1515/9781400873548"", ""10.1177/030631270203200506""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Audiences are shown what reality was like before and immediately after the outbreak of HIV/AIDS. It narrates the transition from a sex-positive era where non-heterosexual people were standing up for their freedom to love, have sex and enjoy life to an era of fear, illness and death that followed the outbreak of HIV. The argument of this article is that contrary to earlier representations of the initial years of the pandemic, It’s a Sin, not unlike Pose (2018–21), succeeds in addressing HIV/AIDS in an empowering rather than stigmatizing manner. In particular, It’s a Sin challenges previous representations of the early years of the pandemic by not contributing to the association of HIV/AIDS with a discourse of illness and death. What is different in this series to earlier representations was the fact that there is no blame towards people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), nor do we see them as passive victims of an unknown virus. Rather, by applying ‘analytics of mediation’, it is argued that the series presents the social suffering that emerged with HIV/AIDS and provides space for audiences to reflect on their contribution to the suffering of others.","[{""name"": ""Angelos Bollas"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000102380260 Dublin City University""]}]","[""10.1080/01956051.2022.2110559"", ""10.1386/jptv_00099_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

There has been limited critical engagement with these productions and Lambert's tenure in general, with the existing literature on this material tending to emphasise the eclectic nature of what were to be TESE's last releases before the company's sale to Cannon ( Hill 1999 ; Moody 2018 ; Park 1990 ; Walker 1985 ; Walker 2004 ; Wickham and Mettler 2005 ). Drawing on a series of detailed interviews with former TESE Production Executive, Graham Easton, along with previously unreleased archival documents from the Film Finances archive, this article develops a more detailed textual analysis and production history of these releases, in order more clearly to map TESE's complexities during this period. By engaging more coherently with the themes and aesthetics of TESE's output, the article argues that there is a consistency to Lambert's productions which can be seen at both a thematic and a stylistic level, centred on notions of constraint and obstacles to communication, and that this was nurtured by the environment created by Lambert and the Film Finances completion bond for each film.","[{""name"": ""Paul Moody"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01439685.2014.879010"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94803-4"", ""10.3366/JBCTV.2004.1.1.33"", ""10.1080/17400309.2010.499771"", ""10.13110/jewifilmnewmedi.1.1.0087""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

During some fifteen years, Varda created over twenty large-scale video installations, numerous smaller ones, and new photographic works, which have been shown in over twenty solo exhibitions and countless group exhibitions in museums, galleries, and art biennials all over the world. This article gives an overview of her installation art and examines how Varda's installations take up and expand on her lifelong passion for still and moving images, painting, photography, and cinema. The author also shows how Varda has rethought and reworked certain subjects that mattered to her throughout her career, by means proper to this new medium. Varda always had the gift to give us the opportunity to reframe our perception of overlooked population groups or objects and to reorient our attention away from the spectacular and extraordinary toward what Georges Perec called the “infraordinary.” If we regard her installations as sites for “active reverie,” we can also comprehend their political dimension as a possible antidote to the current state of the world.","[{""name"": ""Dominique Bluher"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Its methodology has often been criticised for a lack of rigour. However, few have treated methodology as the focus of their discussion. In this chapter, a comprehensive overview of the methodological issues of survey-based user expectations research is provided, with topics covering the construct, criteria, instrument, response format, levels of measurement, measures of central tendency, and sampling. As an illustration for the methodology under discussion, the results of the classic study by Bühler (1986) are reanalysed by using different measures of central tendency. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the importance of incorporating users’ actual experience to make user-related research on interpreting more relevant.","[{""name"": ""Minhua Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Hong Kong Baptist University""]}]","[""10.1515/mult.1988.7.4.411"", ""10.1503/cmaj.080372"", ""10.1075/target.5.1.02che"", ""10.1075/intp.15.1.02che"", ""10.7202/009351ar"", ""10.1080/09076761003728554"", ""10.30827/sendebar.v26i0.2955"", ""10.1075/btl.52"", ""10.1075/btl.2.24kop"", ""10.7202/003364ar"", ""10.1080/10447319309526075"", ""10.1075/intp.1.2.01mos"", ""10.7202/003847ar"", ""10.1075/btl.43.10poc"", ""10.1075/bct.32.05poc"", ""10.4324/9781315678467"", ""10.4324/9781315649573"", ""10.1075/intp.7.1.02rus"", ""10.1126/science.103.2684.677"", ""10.1007/s11135-013-9920-7"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2010.02.004""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"
10.3366/jbctv.2021.0564,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Unproductive Co-production: European Integration, the British Film Industry and the Franco-British Co-production Agreement of 1965","The negotiation of bilateral co-production agreements had a major impact on European film-making from the 1950s to the 1970s. These agreements also provided the basis for the closer integration of Europe's film industries within what was then the European Economic Community (EEC). However, the British government was slow to adopt co-production arrangements and British film-makers tended to be more reticent about using them once they were made available. This article examines the British experience of European co-production during this period, focusing on the negotiation and implementation of the Franco-British co-production agreement of 1965 in the context of broader debates about film production and policy within the EEC. Particular attention is given to Someone Behind the Door (1971), a proposed Franco-British film which was ultimately made as a collaboration between French and Italian production companies after delays on the British side caused the French producer to withdraw from the UK. The correspondence collected by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) as the proposal for Someone Behind the Door was processed – including input from film union and producer associations – provides a unique insight into the bureaucratic policies and procedures which encumbered European co-production in Britain. While continental film-makers established comfortable habits of cooperation, British co-production was stymied from the outset by a misalignment between the interests of Britain's government, its film unions and its producers.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan Stubbs"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/9781119006145.ch6"", ""10.1080/0143968032000095569"", ""10.1080/09639480601115268"", ""10.1111/jcms.12202"", ""10.1080/13662710701524072"", ""10.4324/9780203868997"", ""10.1080/01439680802230886"", ""10.3366/E174345210900065X""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.3366/jbctv.2021.0563,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Unpiecing the Jigsaw: Compulsive Heterosexuality, Sex Crime, Class and Masculinity in Early 1960s British Cinema","This article explores the discursive intersections of masculinity, class and heterosexual desire in the still undervalued British police procedural film, Jigsaw. It considers the film both as an example of a new style of cinematic crime narrative and as a significant conjectural text in which ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ and marriage, especially in their post-war and mid-century forms, are re-articulated, here as compulsive heterosexuality: a masculine drive that can ultimately lead to sexual murder. The film's low-key naturalistic style owes much to the newly realist television drama of the period, while its identification of middle-class masculinity as the locus of transgression carries cultural resonances well beyond the ostensible project of the film's narrative. Released in 1962, Jigsaw was in effect squeezed between, on the one hand, the British New Wave and, on the other, the pop musicals and London-focused films that dominated cinema in the UK in the mid-1960s. However, the casting of dependable Jack Warner as the investigating detective and its Brighton setting mark it out as an important text situated on the cusp between older versions of the crime film and the new permissiveness. Jigsaw's interrogation of the problematic sexual behaviour of two ostensibly middle-class, middle-aged men is therefore particularly interesting, especially when placed within the context of the cultural anxieties about marriage, the increasingly fluid class system of the early 1960s and an emergent youth culture.","[{""name"": ""Estella Tincknell"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3366/JBCTV.2006.3.2.266"", ""10.1080/13619460701189542"", ""10.1007/978-1-84457-574-9_4"", ""10.1057/9781137274595"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0424.2007.00469.x"", ""10.1093/screen/26.1.34"", ""10.1515/9781400862184"", ""10.1080/01439685.2016.1220765"", ""10.1093/screen/25.4-5.22"", ""10.7765/9781526141361.00010"", ""10.1353/jowh.2003.0079"", ""10.1177/1468797606071478"", ""10.3167/001115706780600666""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1386/ac_00010_2,ASIAN CINEMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Unpacking the 'Singapore New Wave',"As the cinema of a small nation, Singapore cinema punches above its weight. The series of international film festival awards won by Singaporean filmmakers alongside the multiple books published on Singapore cinema since the 2010s seem to signal a revival of the industry. This editorial introduction unpacks the term ‘Singapore New Wave’ as a starting point for this Special Issue to raise questions about the changes that appear to be happening in Singapore’s film industry. By situating the ‘Singapore New Wave’ within global cinema, this article argues for the importance of considering the issue of survival in the cinema of a small nation, and for an expansion of ways in which film scholars can gain the critical insights traditionally obtained from conventional new wave films. More positively, this more expansive working definition adds to broader new wave literature by exploring unconventional ways in which films can constitute or contribute to a new wave beyond traditional genres, auteurs, styles or themes associated with new wave cinema.","[{""name"": ""Siao Yuong Fong"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121806431 Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""How Wee Ng"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000090468598 University of Westminster""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1468-0483.1988.tb02092.x"", ""10.1080/14649373.2017.1277834"", ""10.1386/trac.1.1.7/1"", ""10.1177/186810340902800402"", ""10.1080/14649373.2011.578792"", ""10.21315/km2018.36.1.1"", ""10.1142/9789813236899_0019""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The One Direction fandom was particularly pervasive on the blogging site Tumblr, which was prominent between 2007 and 2018 both for its chaotic and confusing “rhizomatic” structure, as well as its popularity with marginalized users and fan communities. This article uses the One Direction fandom as a lens through which to examine the affordances of Tumblr as a platform. It argues that Tumblr encourages its users to draw on the fragmentary, potentially incoherent pieces of information they regularly encounter on the site in order to collectively create narratives that can accommodate them. In other words, Tumblr's platform characteristics produce a queer temporality that combines provisionality and multiplicity with narrative forms and meanings. The article highlights three specific characteristics of Tumblr's platform—its “backward scroll,” its tagging structure, and its recirculation of content—that together encourage users to understand time as comprised of these multiple provisional pasts, presents, and futures. The article points toward the way that narrative and theories of collective storytelling can be used as frameworks for understanding social media platforms.","[{""name"": ""Anne-Charlotte Mecklenburg"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Based on the transcripts of the legal proceedings of the La Manada gang-rape case, Jauría not only clarifies this controversial case for different types of audiences, but it also poses very important questions concerning the nature of rape and how the judicial system treats the victims of rape. This article studies the performative force of tribunal verbatim in shaping the audience’s understanding of an actual gang-rape case and indicates how a feedback loop is created in the performance itself, transforming the spectators’ attitudes.

To heal from trauma, Thelma must free herself from parental control.

Fostering such infrastructures is vital for reconfiguring existing social relations and redistributing resources in the face of increasing sociocultural asymmetry. However, I argue that transforming collaborating ‘strangers’ into interdependent components of a sustainable symbiotic community necessitates the implementation of a collaborative ergonomics. It is an ergonomics concerned with the efficiency and efficacy of collaboration that actively seeks to traverse boundaries and borders. Linguistic translation, lexical translation and the transference and co-production of embodied knowledge are the crucial steps for effecting a collaborative ergonomics. Signs of an emerging symbiosis include the increasingly collaborative relationships between the collaborators and the transformation of embodied practices into highly reflexive and rigorous praxis.","[{""name"": ""PEILIN LIANG"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/fmt.2010.0009"", ""10.1080/13569783.2012.694032"", ""10.4324/9780203852897"", ""10.1353/tt.2018.0005"", ""10.1080/14649373.2016.1217633"", ""10.1080/13569783.2018.1551128"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02704-9"", ""10.1080/13569783.2015.1068109"", ""10.2307/j.ctv4cbhcz"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-01424-5"", ""10.1016/S0003-6870(00)00034-X""]",['Engineering'],['Biomedical Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"
10.3366/film.2020.0127,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,Touch as Proximate Distance: Post-Phenomenological Ethics in the Cinema of Isabel Coixet,"In the wake of paradigm-shifting works on cinematic affect over the last few decades that have challenged psychoanalytically based gaze theory, embodied perception and sensory-affective experience have become fundamental concepts in much of contemporary screen studies. Even though the proponents of the affective turn in film studies present diverse theoretical approaches to affect – from Deleuzian “haptic visuality” to phenomenologically informed film theory – it seems evident that they all draw, to a greater or lesser degree, on the sense of touch as the affective axis of perception. Conceptualized this way, the sense of touch facilitates a mode of mutual embodiment between the viewer and the film image, a relationship based on immediacy and exchange, which, according to some of the approaches to cinematic affect, might also translate into a particular ethical position of embracing and opening up to the world and to the Other. The cinema of Isabel Coixet seems to exemplify these claims. Her oeuvre, as I shall illustrate, is often discussed in terms of intimacy, encounter and reciprocity, as well as the sensuous visual and sonorous textures which compose her films. Nevertheless, in this article I will suggest that Coixet evinces a much more ambiguous attitude towards touch, which often goes beyond the prevalent models of haptic visuality or embodied perception as conceptualized in phenomenological film theory. Drawing on Laura McMahon, I seek to interrogate the concept of touch by engaging with Jean-Luc Nancy's anti-ocularcentric, post-phenomenological reflections on community, offering an analysis of three films produced at different moments in Coixet's career – The Secret Life of Words (2005), Yesterday Never Ends (2013) and Endless Night (2015). The choice of works is dictated by their particular tactile aesthetics, as well as their explicit concern to go beyond the models of autonomous being towards an ethics of relationality between self and world, while being mindful of the limit as the very condition for its emergence.","[{""name"": ""Katarzyna Paszkiewicz"", ""affiliation"": [""University of the Balearic Islands""]}]","[""10.1525/9780520943902"", ""10.19079/metodo.3.1.221"", ""10.1386/shci.8.1.87_1"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748685134.001.0001"", ""10.1386/ijis.29.1.65_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41024-1_7"", ""10.1080/14636204.2010.538244"", ""10.1215/9780822381372"", ""10.1386/sfc.8.1.29_1"", ""10.3366/E0264833408000199"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-47428-5_18"", ""10.1093/screen/16.3.6"", ""10.1515/9781503619005"", ""10.1163/9789401210805"", ""10.1353/com.2012.0006""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Earlier that day, the twenty-something soldier from Franche-Comté had led a daring assault, neutralized several Swiss Guards with his bare hands, and supposedly disabled a cannon that was pointed at his charging comrades. As the sun set, Arné was greeted by throngs of cheering Parisians, who joined the younggrenadierin patriotic songs, chants, and dancing. What Arné perhaps did not understand when he finally went to sleep that night was that he was about to become a theatrical star and a public figure. The next morning, Arné was back in the streets, this time “drawn through Paris in a triumphal chariot.” Several weeks later, he was portrayed as the protagonist inLa Fête du grenadier, the first play dedicated to the July events, which premiered at the Théâtre de l'Ambigu on 3 September. That evening, the real-life Arné, and not the actor who was playing him, was “enthusiastically celebrated by the spectators and at the end of the piece went onstage to standing ovations.”","[{""name"": ""Logan J.

This article discusses a three-month theatre-making programme with sixteen children from a low-income residential estate in Singapore. The programme, which culminated in two public performances, offered opportunities for the young people to re-engage with situations and experiences from their own lives. While exploration and story creation involved a fictional lens, the authors note the importance of including elements of authentic stories from the lives of participants. The theatre-making became a critical platform for the participants to examine the identities they performed; a state ofbeing, and offered ways for them to see how they could shape future identities for themselves through the process ofbecoming. It was also a physical and dialogical space providing young people in need of supportive structures in their lives with alternative perspectives and voices.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Wong"", ""affiliation"": [""National Institute of Education, Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Penny Bundy"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404375432 Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia""]}]","[""10.1037/0003-066X.37.2.122"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep2802_3"", ""10.1386/atr.5.3.225_1"", ""10.1249/FIT.0000000000000318"", ""10.1080/13569781003700052"", ""10.3390/socsci6040139"", ""10.3102/0013189X030007010"", ""10.1080/1356978042000185911"", ""10.1080/13569783.2016.1155408"", ""10.1080/13569783.2016.1228448"", ""10.58680/la198725485"", ""10.1080/13569780903286105"", ""10.1002/JAAL.195"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8578.2009.00414.x"", ""10.1080/13569783.2015.1059747"", ""10.1080/13632752.2017.1287348"", ""10.1386/atr_00039_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

The Madrid neighbourhood in which most of the narrative develops, Las Salesas, is transformed in the movie through the presence in its midst of transnational star Ricardo Darín and the urban sensibility contributed by Barcelona-based director Cesc Gay. As a consequence,Truman’s construction of space becomes part of a Hispanic American imaginary which, originating in industrial practices, financial motivations and a vaguely defined common cultural space, attempts to supersede colonial history within the logics of globalization, transnationalism and cosmopolitan sensibilities.","[{""name"": ""Celestino Deleyto"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121528769 Universidad de Zaragoza""]}]","[""10.1386/trac.3.2.157_1"", ""10.3828/bhs.2015.25"", ""10.1080/17450101.2012.747774"", ""10.1515/9781782041306-006"", ""10.1002/9780470712948.ch1"", ""10.1386/slac_00011_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

In need of culturally and politically legitimized familial structures to ensure the child’s moral and physical needs are met, substitute parental figures loom large in narratives of orphanhood where the (anti-)hero comes good. This article will consider the presentation of female orphans in two films: Carla Simón’s Catalan film Estiu 1993/Summer 1993 (Simón, 2017) presents the story of Frida, who has just lost her parents to AIDS and is relocated to her aunt and uncle’s rural family home, while Saura’s celebrated Cría cuervos/Raise Ravens (Saura, 1976) focuses on Ana, one of three sisters recently orphaned and now under the care of their aunt in late-Francoist Madrid.

The objective of this article is to identify and discuss the sociocultural and political factors for the media advocacy efforts in fighting sexual harassment in Egypt and to evaluate their influence on the campaign’s outcomes. Using the triangulation approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with advocates, media experts and policy-makers. The analysis revealed six influential factors that can inform and improve future media advocacy campaigning. The pivotal factor is ‘focusing events’, which are a golden opportunity due to its effectiveness in getting the attention of various publics and pushing forward the required policy solutions, which is discussed from the agenda-setting lens. Other influential factors include coalition-building, political will, public opinion, the image of advocates, and the influence of social media, which are discussed in further detail.","[{""name"": ""Aya Shata"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368606 University of Miami""]}, {""name"": ""Khaled Amin"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000406399286 Cairo University""]}]","[""10.1097/01.EPX.0000470563.41655.71"", ""10.1017/S0143814X98000038"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01539.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182503"", ""10.1177/1090198105275046"", ""10.1080/17538068.2016.1190589"", ""10.1080/10810731003686606"", ""10.1017/S0020743814001482"", ""10.1177/1527154413493671"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2007.113282"", ""10.1080/14616700500250438"", ""10.1136/tc.2005.015289"", ""10.17813/maiq.17.4.q756724v461359m2"", ""10.1016/S0277-9536(02)00119-3"", ""10.1080/13629387.2013.858034"", ""10.1080/15381501.2011.572742"", ""10.2307/3343024"", ""10.1080/10584609.2012.737419"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2006.00180.x"", ""10.22215/timreview/770"", ""10.1386/jams_00028_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

The success of M-Pesa can be partially attributed to Safaricom’s continuous product innovation. However, few studies have examined the role of M-Pesa employees (called agents) in the adaptation of M-Pesa. To address this gap, we explore the role of M-Pesa agents in Kenya’s mobile money ecosystem by using observations and interviews with agents in Western Kenya. Drawing on technology adaptation and using literature, we explore the role of M-Pesa agents as innovators and facilitators of mobile money services. Findings suggest that although Safaricom expects agents to follow certain protocols, agents revealed that they push back on these expectations by bending corporate procedures to align with the social, economic and cultural realities of their customers. As such, they play a key role in the innovation and adoption process, and arguably, have contributed to the long-term success of M-Pesa.","[{""name"": ""David Tuwei"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000095409781 University of Minnesota Duluth""]}, {""name"": ""Melissa Tully"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368294 University of Iowa""]}]","[""10.1257/jep.24.3.207"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2013.04.001"", ""10.1162/itid.2008.00025"", ""10.1162/itid.2008.00017"", ""10.1057/jit.2013.19"", ""10.1057/ejdr.2013.7"", ""10.1080/2157930X.2014.921353"", ""10.22230/cjc.2011v36n2a2322"", ""10.1108/17410391011019741"", ""10.1016/j.infoandorg.2011.10.001"", ""10.1080/01972240290075039"", ""10.1177/S0038038501000219"", ""10.1016/j.futures.2008.07.038"", ""10.1080/00220388.2017.1296569"", ""10.1002/itdj.20043"", ""10.1136/bmj.320.7227.114"", ""10.1163/9789004245440_006"", ""10.1016/0048-7333(96)00885-2"", ""10.1386/jams_00035_1""]","['Computer Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Information Systems', 'Business and International Management']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"

10.1386/josc_00025_1,JOURNAL OF SCREENWRITING,1303 Drama Film and Television,The post-9/11 American political thriller film: Hollywood's dissident screenplays,"The American political thriller, from its cinematic beginnings in the 1960s until its most recent period of popularity in the late 2000s and the early 2010s, has consistently displayed two salient characteristics: on an extra-textual level, it tends to keep a close relationship with the (geo)political environment at the time of production, with themes that resonate with the cultural moment, sometimes even referencing current events, and frequently challenging traditionally upheld American values with mistrustful attitudes towards the State, its institutions, the military and a suspect corporate establishment. On the other hand, the textual configuration of these films reveals a certain nonconformity with the traditionally dominant narrative-aesthetic norms of Hollywood cinema, featuring reactive agency in its protagonists, an unusual degree of subjectivity in its narration and a remarkable degree of ambiguity in the dramatic resolutions of some storylines. These formal features enhance the thematic concerns and cinematic worldview of the political thriller genre, both creating and exploiting perplexity and paranoia in the audience, through highly demanding narratives that remove the feeling of control from the viewer, and with a specific political intent that becomes exceptionally effective thanks to its entertainment value. The works analysed to illustrate this trend covers theatrically released Hollywood films of the genre from 2001 until the present day, with special attention on the impact of 9/11 and the War on Terror in their narrative premises and themes.","[{""name"": ""Pablo Castrillo"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012191685X Universidad de Navarra""]}]","[""10.1080/01956051.2018.1540393"", ""10.15581/003.28.4.109-123"", ""10.7560/309001-010"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2015.1084802""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

The article examines this process by studying the discursive formation and industrial formulation of the notion of ‘IP’, analysing it as less a novel strategy for filmmaking than a new logic of content generation and labour management, which are mediated and controlled by digital platforms. By studying how the concept was invented, interpreted and utilized in the media industries, I interrogate the interwoven and contested relationship between platforms and content, and examine how the operational logic of platforms changed the ways in which cinematic content is created, distributed and consumed in a transmedial process. The article demonstrates that the transmedia system of IP operates as an assembled network of ‘affective modules’, where affective contacts with and among the audiences are generated, captured and framed by the algorithmic infrastructure of platforms. Such is the process of platformization of cinema; it entails radical transformation not only in content generation also in labour management, a shift from paid professional workers to unpaid participatory fans.","[{""name"": ""Jinying Li"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369094 Brown University""]}]","[""10.1177/1461444809342738"", ""10.1163/22142312-12340081"", ""10.1163/22142312-12340079"", ""10.1163/22142312-12340077"", ""10.1215/9780822372547-005"", ""10.1163/22142312-12340076"", ""10.1386/ac_00022_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Urban Studies', 'Cultural Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1386/jptv_00064_1,JOURNAL OF POPULAR TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,The logic of formatting: A case study on transnational television production,"The transnationalization of television production has been examined by studies on formats and multinational media companies, which have often highlighted the resilience of the local in the global. This article investigates transnationalization on the micro level of television production, drawing on participant observations in a Dutch production company that is partly owned by an American conglomerate. It explores the deep entanglement of the local with the global in different facets of production – including legal, organizational and market aspects – as manifested in daily practices and decision-making in television production. Our analysis reveals an industrial logic of formatting that is not only induced by transnational ownership structures and business models but also deeply ingrained in production routines and programme conventions. Through this logic, transnationalization shapes media professionals’ daily work, the selection of programme ideas and the process of content development.","[{""name"": ""Jolien van Keulen"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122908069 Vrije Universiteit Brussel""]}, {""name"": ""Tonny Krijnen"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000092621349 Erasmus University Rotterdam""]}, {""name"": ""Joke Bauwens"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122908069 Vrije Universiteit Brussel""]}]","[""10.7227/CST.4.1.5"", ""10.1177/0163443719857640"", ""10.1080/14608460220148419"", ""10.1177/1742766513478139"", ""10.1177/1527476418759215"", ""10.1111/j.1753-9137.2009.01037.x"", ""10.1177/1527476407313815"", ""10.1177/1749602018763697"", ""10.1177/0002764211398078"", ""10.1177/1367549412445760"", ""10.1177/1329878X1314900103"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.30.012703.110557"", ""10.16997/wpcc.116"", ""10.1177/1527476419844779"", ""10.1177/1527476404268922"", ""10.1080/15205430903237840"", ""10.1386/jptv_00064_1""]",['Social Sciences'],['Urban Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

As Ana in Cría cuervos and Antía in Julieta both grow up in the shadow of a parent’s death, they are forced to confront the haunting legacy of premature death and the paralysing presence of silence in their family histories. Saura’s Ana and Almodóvar’s Antía must challenge the previous generation’s secrets, which have shaped their upbringings, through the use of imagination and fantasy in order to combat the silences they were raised in, with the ultimate goal of constructing a new family narrative. By forging a new female voice through these child protagonists, Saura and Almodóvar present an enduring intergenerational project for redefining maternity and femininity in the post-Franco era.","[{""name"": ""Mai Hunt"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369094 Brown University""]}]","[""10.1002/9781118325360.ch10"", ""10.1179/146827301787186948"", ""10.1080/10509208309361157"", ""10.1386/slac_00045_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1075/btl.149.06hey,LINKING UP WITH VIDEO: PERSPECTIVES ON INTERPRETING PRACTICE AND RESEARCH,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0301 Law; 0503 Journalism and Communication; 0401 Education,The importance of video recordings in signed language interpreting research,"Abstract In signed language interpreting studies, researchers have devoted attention to the role of video recordings in data collection since the very beginning. Given the visual nature of signed languages, such recordings are imperative in order to investigate various aspects of signed language interpreting such as for instance interpreting strategies, interpreting quality, and interactional aspects of the interpreter mediated communication. This differs from studies looking at spoken language interpreting, where traditionally audio recordings were and to some extent still are the primary source of data in research. In this chapter I claim that, in line with recent shifts in the understanding of communication and interaction (Mondada 2011), any research on interpreting – which is a communicative act – should be based on multimodal data, including the visual, audiological, gestural and any other layers of interaction. As a way of introduction, the chapter gives an overview of how and to which extent video recordings as a data collection tool have been used in three research fields in spoken and signed languages; spoken interaction studies, sign linguistics and interpreting studies, drawing primarily on Erickson (2011), Lucas et al. (2013), and Napier &amp; Leeson (2016). This chapter goes on to discuss the advantages and possible challenges of the use of video as a recording tool in signed language interpreting research, based on a case study on interpreting strategies used by Flemish Sign Language interpreters (Heyerick forthcoming). The same example also illustrates the role of video as an elicitation tool within signed language interpreting research. While the chapter explores the benefits, opportunities and potential obstacles of working with video in research on signed language interpreting, I argue that including video recordings in any research examining communication and/or interaction has the potential to provide very rich data. Video allows for interactive events to be registered in their full multimodal effect and to be regarded and researched as multimodal events (Mondada 2011). This approach can broaden the understanding of human interaction in any field of study.","[{""name"": ""Isabelle Heyerick"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Warwick"", ""KU Leuven""]}]","[""10.1075/target.13.2.03ber"", ""10.4324/9780203856338"", ""10.1080/13645579.2011.563615"", ""10.1075/btl.2.20gil"", ""10.1111/j.1475-682X.1980.tb00023.x"", ""10.7202/010997ar"", ""10.1075/target.14.1.05jaa"", ""10.1075/hts.1.thi1"", ""10.1353/sls.1991.0005"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2002.tb02559.x"", ""10.1075/btl.5.32kal"", ""10.7202/003333ar"", ""10.7202/037201ar"", ""10.1111/j.1473-4192.2004.00067.x"", ""10.1353/sls.2013.0018"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2010.08.019"", ""10.1353/aad.2005.0007"", ""10.1177/1750481307082206"", ""10.1057/9781137309778"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(89)90016-9"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139163910"", ""10.1080/00332747.1964.11023403"", ""10.1080/00332747.1965.11023433"", ""10.7202/004136ar"", ""10.1515/9783110261325.1023"", ""10.16910/jemr.7.1.3"", ""10.1075/intp.17.2.03weh"", ""10.1080/0907676X.2011.632690""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)]]"

The CREW principles are (1) Connection, (2) Reflection, (3) Expression and (4) Witnessing. We describe the work we have been doing for sixteen years with Marin Shakespeare Company facilitating Shakespeare classes and performances in various California prisons with incarcerated men, women and trans-women. Throughout the article, a blend of theory, guiding quotes and case examples from participants is used to demonstrate how the study and performance of Shakespeare in prison, when rooted in a trauma-informed lens and supported by the four principles mentioned above, is helpful in healing trauma and fostering social and emotional well-being amongst individuals who are incarcerated.","[{""name"": ""Suraya Susana Keating"", ""affiliation"": [""0000000102905872California Institute of Integral Studies""]}, {""name"": ""Lynn Baker-Nauman"", ""affiliation"": [""000000040401352XFolsom Lake College""]}, {""name"": ""Marianne Shine"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Scholar""]}]","[""10.1177/0743554897122007"", ""10.1108/IJPH-03-2013-0013"", ""10.1016/0197-4556(83)90006-0"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2021.101766"", ""10.1016/S0197-4556(03)00026-1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00093_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Conservation', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

This article explores the landscapes of the shtetl as they were presented on the Hebrew stage of the 1930s and analyzes their aesthetic and cultural meaning for their audiences at that time. It shows that the shtetl plays formed a memory landscape that served the formation of a modern, consolidated, ethnic Jewish collective in Palestine, which shared a unified narrative of its past, as well as national aspirations for the future. Shelly Zer-Zion is a lecturer of theatre at the University of Haifa and was previously a Fulbright post-doctoral scholar at New York University. Her recent publications include Habima in Berlin: The Institutionalization of a Zionist Theatre (Magness Press, 2015), and her research is currently supported by the Israeli Science Foundation.","[{""name"": ""Shelly Zer-Zion"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This chapter focuses on teacher-researchers, contextualising them within the frame of institutional change and intercultural music teacher education. Taking an active role in educational development and regenerating usual patterns of action in music-education institutions sets various challenges as well as opportunities for the teacher-researchers involved. In this chapter we reflect on experiences through two intercultural collaborations: (1) Global Visions Through Mobilizing Networks: Co-Developing Intercultural Music Teacher Education in Finland, Israel and Nepal (a research sub-project in Nepal), and (2) A collaboration between Malmö Academy of Music and Vietnam National Academy of Music under a project Supporting Vietnamese Culture for Sustainable Development. We reflect on these processes through core concepts of affective actions and micropolitics. Our aim is to contribute to knowledge building in the field of sustainable institutional change aiming for globally appropriate music teacher education.","[{""name"": ""Vilma Timonen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anna Houmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eva Sæther"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13632439969203"", ""10.1017/S0265051708008115"", ""10.1080/14613808.2013.851662"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91599-9_8"", ""10.1177/174114328201000202"", ""10.2307/256727"", ""10.1177/1321103X15590698"", ""10.4135/9781446250945""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['Education', 'Music', 'Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0403 体育学', 0.7413), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7214)]]"

Endowing such an enterprise was bold, but not entirely unprecedented for this federal agency tasked with restoring disabled Americans to productive employment. Founded in 1920, the federal–state vocational rehabilitation program, or VR, ascended to institutional and ideological prominence during World War II and maintained this position well into the 1960s and beyond. VR distinguished itself not only through positing competitive employment as the solution to disabled Americans’ dependence on the state, but the specific means through which it would restore the disabled to productivity: the multidisciplinary expertise of physicians, psychologists, physical therapists, and rehabilitation counselors who collectively sought to render rehabilitants employable through a series of therapeutic interventions. Whereas disability activists focused on combatting the structural barriers disabled workers experienced in the labor market, “rehabilitationists” emphasized the imperative for disabled people to acclimate to existing work environments through individual physical and psychological transformation.","[{""name"": ""Patrick McKelvey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0047404514000396"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2rh28df"", ""10.7591/9781501713798"", ""10.3828/jlcds.2010.13"", ""10.18574/nyu/9780814799666.001.0001"", ""10.1215/01642472-9034390""]",['Psychology'],['Clinical Psychology'],"[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

10.3366/film.2020.0145,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,The Politics of Humour in Kafkaesque Cinema: AWorld-Systems Approach,"Kafka's work has exercised immense influence on cinema and his reflections on diminished human agency in modernity and the dominance of oppressive institutions that perpetuate individual or social alienation and political repression have been the subject of debates by philosophers such as Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, and Alexander Kluge. Informed by a world-systems approach and taking a cue from Jorge Luis Borges’ point that Kafka has modified our conception of the future, and André Bazin's suggestion that literary concepts, characters and styles can exceed “novels from which they emanate”, I understand the Kafkaesque as an elastic term that can refer to diverse films that might share thematic preoccupations, but also aesthetic and formal differences. In this article, I explore the politics of humour in Kafkaesque cinema with reference to the following films: The Overcoat ( Шинель, 1926, Gregor Koznitzev and Leo Trauberg), The Shop on Main Street ( Obchod na korze, 1965, Ján Kadár), and Death of a Bureaucrat ( La muerte de un burócrata, 1966, Tomás Gutiérrez Alea). I draw attention to the dialectics of humour and the connection between the Kafkaesque and slapstick so as to show how humour is deployed as a means of political critique.","[{""name"": ""Angelos Koutsourakis"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Leeds""]}]","[""10.2307/3194413"", ""10.7312/bide17644-007"", ""10.7312/bide17644"", ""10.7312/bide17644-012"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199279456.013.0019"", ""10.1111/j.1470-9856.2008.00283.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-05441-0_1"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521663148.003"", ""10.1057/9781137378613_8"", ""10.2307/1211748"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226451664.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315694832"", ""10.5406/illinois/9780252036934.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195381221.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781316084243.037"", ""10.1632/pmla.2015.130.5.1420"", ""10.1017/9781316084243.012"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226201351.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822399018"", ""10.7312/bide17644-017""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

This is a largely unexplored area, as interest in this phenomenon has largely focused on the so-called “plot twist movie,” which is an older narrative tradition. In order to explain this aesthetic phenomenon, it draws on the model of surprise originally proposed by the cognitive psychologists Wulf Meyer, Rainer Reisenzein, and Achim Schützwohl. Plot twists are characterized by three distinct but intimately intertwined temporal segments and their corresponding functions, which are explained by this model. The objective of this article is to explore how cognitive-emotional interactions shape the aesthetic viewing experience and to identify how that experience relates to shows’ artistic qualities. Game of Thrones (S01 and S03), Homeland (S01), and Westworld (S01) will be used as test cases. In each of the three plot segments, there are specific processes that distinguish the experience of surprise as an aesthetic phenomenon.","[{""name"": ""Héctor J.

10.1093/adaptation/apab017,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,The Paradox of Bazinian Adaptation: Translation and Fidelity in Saramago's The Double and Villeneuve's Enemy,"Abstract Discussing Enemy (2013), his adaptation of Portuguese novelist José Saramago’s The Double (2002), French-Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve remarks: ‘the best way to respect an author is to be very honest about the way you adapted [their work] and to totally destroy the original and make it your own’. Villeneuve’s recreative (translational) use of ‘respect’ reverberates intertextually with André Bazin’s description of respect-based fidelity. For Bazin, utterly faithful yet completely original adaptations could be achieved through ‘a ceaselessly creative respect’ in which faithfulness and unfaithfulness paradoxically converge in translational acts of recreation. I term this paradoxical doubling the paradox of adaptation in Bazin. In part 1 of this article, I explore how Bazin illustrates that paradox in his essays about adaptation with examples of translation, and particularly with examples of Baudelaire’s and Mallarmé’s translations of Edgar Allan Poe (an emblem of intertextual rewriting in French literature). Bazin’s references to translation provide an aperture into a wider understanding of adaptation’s intertextual and heteroglossic nature. Bazinian adaptations are faithful reconstructions and unfaithful transformations. As I discus in part 2 of this essay, Villeneuve capitalizes on this paradox in his recreative translation of The Double. The film reflects and ‘destroys’ (as Villeneuve would say) Saramago’s novel in order to recreate it. Through its re-theorization of Bazin’s fidelity as a translational prism of recreation, this essay contributes to the ‘resurgence of (pro)fidelity criticism’ (Hermansson) as well as to ongoing calls (Krebs, Venuti) for greater attention to the hermeneutic synergy between translation and adaptation studies.","[{""name"": ""Micah K Donohue"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Languages and Literature, Eastern New Mexico University , Station 19, Portales, NM , USA""]}]","[""10.1515/9781400841219"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apv011"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apv014"", ""10.4324/9781315678481-15"", ""10.2307/1770585"", ""10.2307/j.ctv16km1dn"", ""10.1177/1470412907075066""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

I show that Hitchcock's guiding principle was often not suspense but surprise. The penchant to surprise explains why Hitchcock utilized the surprise plot, as well as why he is often considered a deeply conflicted artist. In addition to standard surprise and suspense, which generate little uncertainty for the audience, Hitchcock developed parallel versions of these structures that incorporated premise uncertainty and allowed telling two stories at once. Double plots, which I term overt, structure some of Hitchcock's most sophisticated works, such as Notorious and Suspicion. The distinction between standard and overt surprise and suspense helps us better understand both Hitchcock's mastery and his enduring relevance for all narrative media today.","[{""name"": ""Maria Belodubrovskaya"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'History', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

The paper considers how genre and structure are affected across a range of adaptations, both novel to film/TV and novel to novel. This process allows for the consideration of two linked but discrete outcomes of adaptation; firstly, an exploration of what is currently understood by the signifier ‘the Jungle Book’, and secondly, what is transferred when very different acts of adaptation are performed on the same text. In the same way that the hermeneutic circle shows the impossibility of interpreting any individual part without reference to the whole, there is a particular type of text, which I will call hegemonic, which can only be fully explicated when it is considered as being composed both of itself and its adaptive iterations.","[{""name"": ""Harry Oulton"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English and Comparative Literature, Goldsmiths University of London , London , UK""]}]","[""10.7765/9781526108920"", ""10.1017/S1060150301002108"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.1016/j.jslw.2007.07.005"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-02551-0"", ""10.1002/9781118312032.ch5"", ""10.1057/9781403937759"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-20272-0"", ""10.58680/rte20031780""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.3366/jbctv.2020.0542,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,The Invisible Institution? Reconstructing the History of BAFTA and the 1958 Merger of the British Film Academy with the Guild of Television Producers and Directors,"As a cultural institution of national and global significance, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) is notably absent from existing scholarship on the media industries. More importantly, BAFTA's role as an independent arts charity set up by the industry to support and develop new talent is often overlooked. Instead, references to BAFTA made by media and film scholars most frequently take the form of footnotes or digressions that detail particular awards or nominations. Drawing on a range of archival sources, including BAFTA's own records, we address this significant omission within existing scholarship on the British cultural and creative industries. In particular, we examine the period 1947–68, focusing on the 1958 merger of the British Film Academy with the Guild of Television Producers and Directors to form a new institution, known as the Society of Film and Television Arts (SFTA, later renamed BAFTA). This was achieved despite the well-documented tensions existing between the two industries throughout the period, which we identify and analyse within this historical context. We argue that a crucial factor driving the 1958 merger was the desire to develop quality training schemes across both industries. This, in turn, was partly enabled by an egalitarian turn in post-war British society towards the development of greater social equality and mobility. In reconstructing these events, we therefore interrogate and reassess the role played by this key national institution on the development of the creative and cultural industries, offering an expansion and revision of scholarship on media histories of post-war Britain.","[{""name"": ""Emma Pett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Helen Warner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9781137311177"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2013.0157"", ""10.1093/screen/hjx037"", ""10.7227/CST.1.1.10"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198742197.001.0001"", ""10.3366/E1743452109000910"", ""10.1007/978-1-84457-896-2"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748698233.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198159346.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198742340.001.0001"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2014.0231"", ""10.4324/9780203879597"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2014.0229"", ""10.1080/1025386042000246197"", ""10.3366/JBCTV.2004.1.1.78"", ""10.1386/jmpr.12.2.125_3"", ""10.2307/j.ctv36xvhbb"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2014.0230"", ""10.5040/9781501340550"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2018.0401"", ""10.5040/9780755695706"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2013.0160"", ""10.1525/fmh.2016.2.2.71"", ""10.4324/9780203426647""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

10.1017/S0040557422000059,THEATRE SURVEY,1303 Drama Film and Television,"The Emergence of the Integrated Musical: Otto Harbach, Oratorical Theory, and the Cinema","In 1920, Oscar Hammerstein II—fresh from the modest success of his debut musical Always You—was eager to write the show for Frank Tinney that his uncle Arthur was to produce. As Hugh Fordin wrote, “Arthur, confident of his nephew's ability but aware that he needed to learn more about his craft, brought in Otto Harbach to collaborate on the book and lyrics.” The two men joined forces on that show—Tickle Me—and went on to write such classics as Rose-Marie (1924, Rudolf Friml &amp; Herbert Stothart), Sunny (1925, Jerome Kern), and The Desert Song (1926, Sigmund Romberg). After working with Harbach (Fig. 1), Hammerstein would venture on his own and write Show Boat, Oklahoma!, and be credited as having ushered in a new era of musical theatre, chiefly defined by his success at “integration.” As literary scholar Scott McMillin writes, the conventional idea of integration is that “all elements of a show—plot, character, song, dance, orchestration, and setting—should blend together into a unity, a seamless whole.” In popular commentary, this development is often attributed to Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's 1943 musical Oklahoma!, as seen in John Kenrick's claim that “[t]hroughout the show, every word, number, and dance step was an organic part of the storytelling process. Instead of interrupting the dialogue, each song and dance continued it. For the first time, everything flowed in an unbroken narrative line from overture to curtain call.” Other historians and critics are more tempered, touting the success of Oklahoma! while insisting that its integration must be seen as part of a broader historical arc. Andrew Lamb, for example, celebrates Oklahoma! by noting that it was the realization of “[w]hat Kern and Gershwin had experimented with as far back as the 1920s—a piece that was not just a collection of catchy numbers, but a fusion of drama, song, and dance.” In a 1962 article, Stanley Green notes that the creators of Oklahoma! “blended all the theatrical arts with such skill tha[t] many accepted it as a revolution in the theatre,” but he argues that their accomplishment was actually “more evolutionary than revolutionary. Rather than inaugurating any trend toward the well-integrated show, what it did achieve was a perfection in technique of a development that had been going on ever since the second decade of the century.” While Green cites the Princess Theatre musicals of Bolton, Wodehouse, and Kern as the earliest examples of integration, this lineage goes back further—further than Hammerstein, further than Gershwin, further than Kern. To understand the history of the idea of “integration” in musical theatre, we must go back to the artist whose 1910 musical Madame Sherry, hailed as the “musical comedy rage of a generation,” was celebrated by critics for the way its “entertaining elements” were “cleverly interwoven into a consistent whole,” for the innovative ways that “the songs, lyrics, and ensemble numbers . . . are directly related to the story of the comedy, and there is a plausible excuse for every musical interruption.” That artist—who not only developed an innovative approach to musical theatre but also articulated a coherent theory of it—was Otto Harbach.","[{""name"": ""Bradley Rogers"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Music'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

10.3138/md.63.4.1094,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,"The Concept of the Concept Musical: Love Life, Cabaret, Company","This article approaches the concept musical as a form defined by epistemological self-critique. Inviting spectators to affectively engage with its thematic concerns precisely by problematizing the spectators’ pleasurable consumption of musical theatre conventions, the concept musical deploys this reflection for potentially political purposes. Through a close reading of Love Life, the 1948 musical often understood as the first concept musical, I argue that the show’s unique structure cultivates the sense that capitalism, as embodied in the conventions of popular entertainment, has intervened in the life and happiness of the musical’s central family. By critiquing popular culture, Love Life – itself an element of popular culture – questions whether its own materials, the popular songs that make up its score and the vaudeville show on which its form is based, are fragmenting and dangerous illusions. I show how Cabaret pursues a similar epistemological experiment, implicating spectators in the passive sensual pleasures that the show frames as having facilitated fascism – just as Company pursues a formal structure that implicates spectators in the issues of “observing the action” that plague its central character, Bobby.","[{""name"": ""Bradley Rogers"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-1-137-53453-8"", ""10.1525/9780520951839"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195120127.001.0001"", ""10.1386/smt.4.3.331_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Music'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

The author argues for the use of a hybrid approach to drama therapy inside prisons that simultaneously includes forms of self-advocacy, legislative theatre and self-revelatory modes in order to successfully hold up a mirror to Lebanese society, implicating its anachronistic legal codes in the oppression that often leads to chaos and madness. In the course of collaborating on their artistic journey, two segregated populations of participants, one identified by the Lebanese Penal Code as ‘insane’ and the other as ‘regular’, collaborated and revealed stories of domestic violence, traumatic childhoods, social dysfunctions, the lingering impact of an earlier civil war and the deprivation of legal and human rights. Standing up before numerous audiences, including high officials of the government, they dared not only to reflect on their own lives but also to heal their own and their community’s wounds.","[{""name"": ""Zeina Daccache"", ""affiliation"": [""Catharsis - Lebanese Center for Drama Therapy""]}]","[""10.17925/ENR.2017.12.02.60"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-53593-1_16"", ""10.1386/dtr.1.1.71_1"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2021.101766"", ""10.1386/dtr_00090_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Conservation', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It builds on my earlier work, ‘Theme and complex narrative structure in HBO’s Big Little Lies 2017’ (2019), wherein I applied Porter et al.’s (2002) structuralist narrative tool, the ‘Scene Function Model’, to investigate the way narrative and theme is progressed in complex interweaving stories via the writing of core or ‘kernel’ narrative scenes. Herein, I further investigate storytelling in series TV by proposing the ‘satellite’ narrative scene as a means by which the screenwriter may conceptualize and deploy metaphor to create viewer engagement. First, I consider David E. Kelley’s series screenplay, Big Little Lies, as a blueprint for HBO’s televised series. Specifically, I apply theories of Complex TV, Gothic Television and Domestic Noir to consider how Kelley deploys the Female Gothic as extended metaphor to inform formal narrative elements including the pre-titles sequences and flashbacks repeated across episodes.","[{""name"": ""Margaret McVeigh"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404375432 Griffith Film School, Griffith University""]}]","[""10.1386/josc.6.2.189_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-69338-5_2"", ""10.1080/01956050209605556"", ""10.1386/josc.7.3.299_1"", ""10.1386/josc.8.1.5_1"", ""10.1386/josc_00013_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

The paper traces the process of politicisation of rock music and compares the two different cultural spaces by mapping each space’s state ideology, aesthetic traditions and identities, and discriminative political and economic tools used to marginalise rock. Here the term politicisation refers mainly to the polarisation between the communist regimes’ restrictive policies, and the attempts of the rock scenes to sustain their discriminating characteristics and relationship to protest. While in European communist states rock played a relevant subversive role, conversely, in China any ‘rocking’ of the state has largely been averted. The Chinese rock scene as an off-mainstream urban subculture has received less popular support than its counterpart in Europe and has also proved less politically significant. This comparative case study discusses the relationship between popular music and politics by tracing analogies and differences between the former Czechoslovakia, where the ideologisation and politicisation of rock reached the highest point in the Eastern Bloc, and contemporary China.","[{""name"": ""Rudolf Fürst"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of International Relations Prague, Czech Republic""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780195139433.001.0001"", ""10.1386/fspc.2.2.257_1"", ""10.1525/9780520936539"", ""10.1080/09502386.2020.1844260"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2011.12.002"", ""10.1017/S030574100500038X"", ""10.1080/07036337.2010.546849"", ""10.4324/9780203357057"", ""10.5296/jsr.v4i2.4503"", ""10.4324/9780203076811"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139051682"", ""10.1177/0009445515597805"", ""10.1080/02560046.2020.1830141"", ""10.1080/1067056042000281486"", ""10.1080/14742830120118909"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511586156"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00043.x"", ""10.1080/10304312.2020.1757039"", ""10.1080/14791420.2019.1637008""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

However, they mainly record either the practices of media consumption of specific media formats included in the structure of a transmedia project or the producers’ ways for constructing a narrative that creates transitions between media platforms. Often, researchers pay little attention to the circumstances of users’ interaction with the fictional world and their social relationships that form around a transmedia project. This study consists of a series of in-depth interviews and observations on the media consumption practices of users and fans of the fictional world which has formed around a series of fantasy works under the general name The Witcher. This transmedia project is interesting because, unlike specially created transmedia franchises with the expansion structures carefully planned by media companies, it forms itself spontaneously, as a result of the activities of different institutions and user participation, does not have a single development strategy, and is shaped by “grass-root” practices.

Trained as a radio journalist who aspired to use sound to immerse the listener in images, Qureshi finds inspiration in Flee’s unique and extraordinary merging of radio and film. Relating the true story of an Afghan refugee’s arrival in Denmark after his escape from the Taliban’s first siege of Kabul in 1989, Flee began as a radio documentary compiled from conversations between Rasmussen and “Amin,” the alias chosen by his childhood friend to protect his privacy. Animators only began visualizing the story once the radio cut was locked.

As such, South African music teacher educators have a unique contribution to make to the international discourse on diversity in music education. This chapter draws on Activity Theory to conceptually position the practices of music teacher education in South Africa, and to place the practices in a wider socio-political environment. Interviews were conducted with four music teacher educators in this interpretative descriptive study, in order to understand their conceptions of multicultural and intercultural music teacher education. Three common practices that are critically framed by the teachers are identified: immersion, interaction and documentation. These practices are then considered in the broader contexts of the structure of the university and the fragmentation of society. The chapter argues on the basis of this analysis that the historically accumulating structural tensions inherent in music teacher education in South Africa should lead to transformation of the activity, but only if music teachers themselves become cognisant of the contradictions inherent in the current practices and collaboratively and creatively expand beyond them.","[{""name"": ""Albi Odendaal"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190263201.001.0001"", ""10.4102/VE.V36I2.1434"", ""10.2307/3399881"", ""10.1080/03057070701832882"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199393749.003.0001"", ""10.1080/13639080020028747"", ""10.1108/09534811111132758"", ""10.1080/02589346.2013.765674"", ""10.1093/afraf/adw072"", ""10.1177/1321103X13508057"", ""10.1080/14649373.2016.1140260"", ""10.47622/978-1-920489-82-3"", ""10.1386/ijcm.3.3.379_1"", ""10.2989/18121004.2013.846991"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-26880-4_7"", ""10.1177/0163443704044219"", ""10.4324/9781315426259"", ""10.22176/act16.3.78""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Education', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Dunham (1909–2006), an African American choreographer and anthropologist, pioneered a “research-to-performance” method to study African-derived dances in the Caribbean and stage them in stylized choreographies. Elite Lima patrons walked out of the theatre during the danced African fertility rite in Dunham's “Rites de Passage,” but the performance left a lasting impression on the Santa Cruzes. Nicomedes Santa Cruz later described the event as the first positive staged demonstration of blackness in Peru—and Victoria Santa Cruz stated that, when they saw Katherine Dunham's production, they knew they had to do something similar.

Shutting the door to her cottage near the shores of the Indian River, Hurston set out to join the local Baptist congregation, where she would hear a sermon delivered by its pastor, the Reverend C. C. Lovelace. Hurston had been pondering the question of how to represent the experience of a church service in a theatrical performance. “Know what I am attempting?” she had written to Langston Hughes a few days earlier, in April 1929. “To set an entire Bapt. service word for word and note for note.” Listening to Lovelace's sermon in Eau Gallie, Hurston admired how the preacher's oratory built seamlessly from a creation story into a fiery vision of divine retribution. She was so taken by the poetry of Lovelace's words that she transcribed his sermon in its entirety. This sermon later served as the centerpiece of the play The Sermon in the Valley, a work that testifies to Hurston's aim to render a Baptist service “word for word and note for note.” Like many of her plays, The Sermon in the Valley reveals the intimate entanglement of her ethnographic compositions and her writing for the stage.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca R.

By unearthing and exploring tensions in the play’s representation of a Sikh community, this article sheds light on some of the tensions in multicultural Britain in order to complicate and challenge an interpretation of the dispute in terms of a reductive binary of creative freedom versus religious censure and censorship. While, for the liberal secularist critic and proponent of free expression, the explosion of taboos is vital to an expansion of freedom, a hard-line adoption of this position that fails to account for the material specificities of a religious response to a creative work, including the demography of the protestors, can result in a curtailment of the freedom of a religious minority. Reading the play in dialogue with the controversy it generated, this article seeks to ground the outbreak of religious minority offence in its local material conditions and, by doing so, to underline the unequal access to social, cultural, and spatial capital that shaped the controversy. It focuses in particular on religious symbols, space, and speech, exploring how they figure in both the literary and social texts.","[{""name"": ""Rehana Ahmed"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7228/manchester/9780719087400.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350206373"", ""10.1057/9780230237018"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004162457.i-241.41"", ""10.1177/1468796807073914"", ""10.1086/599592"", ""10.1215/00382876-2390401"", ""10.1080/09528829008576253"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-20425-6"", ""10.1080/17449855.2015.1125144"", ""10.1017/S0307883306002471"", ""10.1093/0198297556.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

In this article, critical discussions of The End of the End of History by Daniel Zamora, Anton Jäger, Nicholas Kiersey and Richard Sakwa are responded to. Zamora’s focus on the displacement of social conflict outside the workplace is discussed as a feature of political disintermediation, creating a boundless sort of politics. An alternative to Jäger’s proposed term, ‘hyperpolitics’, is then advanced, as a means of leaving open the possibility of greater politicisation in the future. A defence of the way left-populist movements are cast as essentially ‘anti-political’ is then ventured, in opposition to Kiersey. Sakwa’s criticisms of our historicism are then turned on their head, before we consider the impact that the Ukraine war may have on History’s putative return. By way of conclusion, the dichotomies of resignation versus autonomy, and compliance versus social purpose, are discussed as the pivots on which History’s return will be decided.","[{""name"": ""Alex Hochuli"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Political Analyst and Writer, São Paulo, Brazil""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1353/tj.2023.a908732,THEATRE JOURNAL,1303 Drama Film and Television,Skrzypek as Synecdoche: Polish-Jewishness in Fiddler on the Roof,"Abstracts: From a theatre's protest against losing their space, to a themed restaurant, to a shabbat ceremony, Skrzypek na dachu ( Fiddler on the Roof ) appears in Poland in unexpected places. This essay explores the performance's many iterations from its prewar context as Tevye the Dairyman , to the postwar translation of the American musical in the turbulent early 1980s, to Anatewka Restaurant established in 2000, and beyond, to examine how elements of the piece have come to encapsulate certain intangibles of Polish cultural heritage stemming from its Jewish past. In examining its history of performance in Poland, this essay theorizes how Skrzypek as a performance and cultural touchstone comes to stand in for engagement with Polish-Jewishness in Poland today, mapping out Skrzypek and its earlier iterations as they perform a transhistorical bridge spanning pre- through postwar eras. Contextualizing the narrative's historical appearances and collective impact, this essay traces how Jewishness, vis-à-vis Tevye to Skrzypek , has been taken up over time and in changing political contexts to redefine Polishness in various moments. The musical is an important entry into a broader field of inquiry into performances of Jewishness in Poland that collectively perform a broadened Polish narrative that includes the country's now-lost multiethnic past.","[{""name"": ""Rachel Merrill Moss"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"
10.3366/film.2021.0165,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,Silence as Elective Mutism in Minor Cinema,"This article advances mutism as a creative mode and conceptual tool to treat silence in cinema. Whereas mutism can be a productive concept for the study of auditory and visual absence in a broader theoretical framework, my focus here is on the silence of film characters. Drawing on correspondences between the critical and the clinical in Gilles Deleuze’s writing, I argue that adopting mutism as a tool of film-philosophy permits us to supersede traditional film analysis and examine silence not as an interpretive condition at the level of the plot but as a critical-clinical mode of experimentation related to the symptomatology of life. After presenting a brief clinical history of “elective” and “selective” mutism, I then draw on the suppressed understanding of “elective mutism”. I demonstrate that “elective mutism”, which might appear to be a negative and powerless disorder in its clinical presentation, transforms itself into an affirmative and empowering (dis)order that inspires creative experimentation in cinema. In postwar films with mute protagonists, such as Ingmar Bergman’s Persona (1960), “elective mutism” engenders a negative mode of existence in its symptomatology, which can be analysed according to the tenets of Theodor W. Adorno’s philosophy of negativity. By contrast, Deleuze’s philosophy of affirmativity and the concept of minor cinema allow for a renewed positive examination of “elective mutism” in more recent films with silent characters, such as Elia Suleiman’s Palestinian quartet (1996; 2002; 2009; 2019). Approaching minor cinema as both a cinema of experimentation and minoritarian cinema, I contend that in films made by minorities mutism becomes more pronouncedly “elective” in an affirmative sense. As a mode of protest and resistance, “elective mutism” is not only a rejection of the present status quo but also an expression of futurity. Finally, I maintain that the concept of “elective mutism” can relate to and stimulate the discussion of many contemporary sociopolitical phenomena.","[{""name"": ""Tanya Shilina-Conte"", ""affiliation"": [""SUNY at Buffalo""]}]","[""10.1097/00004583-199507000-00007"", ""10.1215/10407391-1428897"", ""10.5040/9781501327285"", ""10.5040/9781350251991"", ""10.1057/9780230294851_5"", ""10.1057/9781137283528"", ""10.1002/1520-6807(197304)10:2<249::AID-PITS2310100223>3.0.CO;2-O"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748634071.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822376903"", ""10.4324/9780203328149"", ""10.1353/frm.0.0048"", ""10.1177/0973258613499096"", ""10.1353/pmc.1998.0022"", ""10.7591/9781501744174"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199570171.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9780748649006"", ""10.1093/screen/hjl031"", ""10.3366/film.2020.0128"", ""10.7312/reme18930"", ""10.1215/9780822396871"", ""10.1080/10509200500526802"", ""10.1192/bjp.96.405.1024"", ""10.1080/09589236.1998.9960700"", ""10.1044/jshd.2401.55"", ""10.5840/philtoday199741Supplement75"", ""10.1111/1475-3588.00065"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1gr7d6q.5""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Owing to his connections with the influential editor Clement Shorter, Shaw had been taking advantage of technological improvements to the halftone process, which had made the mass printing of photographic images possible. Shaw was quick to acknowledge the possibilities of “celebrity” photojournalism; however as an accomplished photographer and critic, he focused on quality artistic portraits of himself that drew attention to his cultural interests, photographic expertise, and friendships. Self-portraits, and photographic portraits by the art photographers Frederick H. Evans and Alvin Langdon Coburn, were selected for publication to promote his life and work. Shaw's ability to harness art photography for the purposes of self-promotion through the popular newspaper-magazines of the day has not previously been recognized.","[{""name"": ""Alice McEwan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

These signs are not completely related to host culture (American) or local culture (Iranian). Although this impossible situation seems very painful at the first glance, it is beneficial for immigrant artist. In this hybridized space, she creates a kind of art which is very innovative and unique, because she is not forced to follow the cliché styles which those cultures are dictating her.","[{""name"": ""Hoda Shabrang"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Demography', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Decolonial performance histories of the Kiji Sibi/Ottawa River necessarily engage histories of early contact, logging, and the construction of hydroelectric dams and nuclear facilities. As the author asks what rivers remember, treating the river as a relative and living archive, she upturns stories suppressed by conventional archival materials. Following three vessels that have inscribed transit pathways along the river—jiimaan/canoe, timber crib, and steamboat—the author turns her eye to Indigenous knowledge systems as she deploys performance analysis to ask what it might have meant for her grandfather to participate in loggers’ shantwy entertainments.","[{""name"": ""Jenn Cole"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.15215/aupress/9780888644909.01"", ""10.51644/9781771121705"", ""10.5749/j.ctt1pwt77c""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1093/adaptation/apab019,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Shakespeare in The Wilds: Experimenting with The Tempest,"AbstractThis article discusses the TV series The Wilds (Amazon Prime, 2020) as an adaptational experiment with Shakespeare’s The Tempest in several respects: as one of the latest complex TV shows to engage with the Shakespearean legacy, it experiments with the serialization of Shakespeare’s plot. Further, being an ‘unmarked’ adaptation that never directly refers to Shakespeare, it tests the limits as to what is ‘Shakespeare’ and what is ‘not Shakespeare’ or ‘no longer Shakespeare’ in the adaptational rhizome created by The Tempest and its reworkings, among which Lord of the Flies, Brave New World, and the TV series Lost are of particular importance for The Wilds. Changing Shakespeare’s character constellation to an all-female group of teenage castaways overseen by a female social scientist modelled on Prospero who seeks to overcome master narratives of fraternal power struggles, colonial exploitation, and patriarchal sexual oppression, The Wilds tests which changes the Shakespeare material can and perhaps needs to undergo to continue to have cultural meaning today. As part of this radical re-gendering, the series multiplies and collates Miranda, Ariel, and Caliban to interrogate contemporary girlhood and the future of intersectional feminism. The article concludes by assessing how the series appeals to differently knowing viewers, some of whom will feel invited to partake in the Tempest experiment, while others will lose Shakespeare’s tracks in The Wilds.","[{""name"": ""Christina Wald"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Literature, Arts, Media, University of Konstanz , Box 161, 78457 Konstanz , Germany""]}]","[""10.1353/sor.2019.0039"", ""10.4324/9781315148922"", ""10.1057/9781137380029_13"", ""10.1007/s12147-016-9153-x"", ""10.5040/9781350068674"", ""10.7765/9781526142320"", ""10.5040/9781472539397-ch032"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-40482-4"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-11153-1"", ""10.1002/9781118501221.ch22"", ""10.1163/156852903765453191"", ""10.1017/9781316286449.002"", ""10.1057/9780230105249_1"", ""10.1353/shb.2014.0015"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-28898-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-74518-3_11"", ""10.56021/9780801865770"", ""10.1057/9781137016461"", ""10.1353/chl.0.0478"", ""10.1215/9780822393337-049"", ""10.5040/9781350391550.ch-008"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-46851-4"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-07602-1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

While ‘body’ is viewed from the perspective of ‘bodyworld’ to denote constitutive and reciprocally shaping human–nonhuman relationalities, the ‘performance’ that occurs in bodies is analyzed in terms of a ‘drama of affect’ to signal the activity that germinates and circulates at various levels of consciousness in human behaviour, whether aesthetic, athletic, or daily.

In the case of the Sámi, the Finno-Ugric indigenous minority who primarily inhabit the northernmost regions of Europe, the need to establish visibility through a variety of film and media channels is amplified by their ongoing constitutional marginalization in both political and economic forums. However, this article asks whether the Sámi face uniquely precarious barriers as indigenous media producers by introducing the concepts of ‘constituted precarity’ and ‘symbolic cultural labour’. Specifically, it frames the idea of constituted precarity as a type of ideological power relationship where the ‘host’ nations strategically engineer the precariousness of Sámi media platforms, primarily through policy. By examining the Sámi film industry’s position in Norway’s regional film funding infrastructure, we can identify different forms of precarity and manifestations of indigenous cultural labour that will help us determine whose interests are represented in the ongoing debates over cultural ownership and Sámi self-determination.","[{""name"": ""Kate Moffat"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000088091613 University of Warwick""]}]","[""10.1002/9781118475300.ch3"", ""10.1515/9781782049210-011"", ""10.1163/9789004363045_002"", ""10.1080/10286632.2015.1128419"", ""10.18261/ISSN2000-8325-2019-01-02"", ""10.1386/jsca_00022_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It sets Sacro GRA within Rosi’s career, his ambiguous identity as an ‘Italian’ filmmaker and the film’s relation to the history of cinema in/on Rome and psycho-geographical road movies. It moves on to analyse Rosi’s treatment of place and urban space, comparing key motifs and patterns in Sacro GRA with the short episode of Fellini’s Roma, also set on the GRA, Rome’s urban outer ring road. This dual reading is articulated around four axes of comparison in the construction and evocation of the ring-road space: street furniture, metacinematic frames and recordings, noises and silences, machines and monsters. Through these and other incidental constellations, the article argues that the two films display parallel, at times symmetrical, fascinations with the urban as simultaneously a space of utopia and dystopia, nature and the man-made, past and future.","[{""name"": ""Robert S.

In medical settings, remote interpreting is increasingly being welcomed as a means to enable better access to healthcare and increased cost-efficiency. Studies on healthcare interpreting over the telephone or by video link have generated predominantly positive results concerning the use of remote modes of interpreting. However, most of these studies originate from medical science and measure user satisfaction with the interpreting mode (face-to-face, telephone interpreting or video interpreting) rather than the possible impact of the different modes on interpreting quality. In interpreting studies, empirical research investigating remote interpreting in medical settings is scarce, but studies on remote interpreting in settings such as conference, business and legal interpreting indicate that the remote conditions are at the very least perceived by users to influence the interpreter’s performance and the communication. In this chapter, we introduce a methodological framework for a systematic assessment of the quality of remote interpreting and the effectiveness of the communication in dialogic healthcare settings, drawing on methods from both interpreting studies and medicine. Central to the research design is a corpus of simulations of interpreter-mediated doctor – patient encounters, performed in the modes face-to-face, telephone and video interpreting. These simulations were submitted to a comparative, multi-modal analysis, the results of which were triangulated with the subjective assessment by the participants. We will first touch upon research issues and caveats relevant to remote healthcare interpreting, emerging from medical studies and interpreting studies. Subsequently, the research design of the present study will be elaborated, followed by a discussion of the preliminary findings of the first series of simulations. Although the data analysis is work in progress, the first outcomes suggest that the use of technology in interpreter-mediated health care impacts mostly on the interactional dynamics of the communication.","[{""name"": ""Esther de Boe"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Antwerp""]}]","[""10.1075/btl.3.05alt"", ""10.1075/btl.3.11and"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511486616"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2005.04.010"", ""10.1075/btl.102"", ""10.1080/1750399X.2014.972029"", ""10.1075/btl.3.12bar"", ""10.1075/intp.9.1.03bra"", ""10.1075/intp.15.2.03bra"", ""10.1001/archpedi.161.1.44"", ""10.7202/002176ar"", ""10.26034/cm.jostrans.2010.579"", ""10.1016/0378-2166(95)00036-4"", ""10.1071/AH16195"", ""10.1542/peds.2009-0769"", ""10.1542/peds.111.1.6"", ""10.1016/j.annemergmed.2012.01.025"", ""10.1007/s11606-007-0360-8"", ""10.1007/s11606-007-0361-7"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511611834"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511607172"", ""10.1097/00005650-199608000-00011"", ""10.21832/9781783097777-005"", ""10.1016/0001-6918(67)90005-4"", ""10.1080/1750399X.2014.972033"", ""10.1075/intp.18.2.02kry"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1497.1999.07258.x"", ""10.1075/intp.9.2.05lee"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1497.2002.10742.x"", ""10.1007/s11606-009-1236-x"", ""10.1089/tmj.2011.0084"", ""10.1075/btl.102.08mas"", ""10.1075/bct.9.08mer"", ""10.7202/011014ar"", ""10.1075/intp.8.1.04mou"", ""10.1075/intp.6.2.02nap"", ""10.1016/0885-2308(92)90021-U"", ""10.4324/9780203504802"", ""10.1075/bct.9"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2rh2bq2.13"", ""10.1353/lan.1974.0010"", ""10.1016/j.eurger.2010.04.002"", ""10.1080/13556509.1999.10799040"", ""10.1075/btl.102.02teb"", ""10.1080/13556509.1999.10799043"", ""10.1080/0907676X.2017.1321025"", ""10.1080/0907676X.2018.1549087"", ""10.1075/hoph.4.07xud"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9841.2004.00266.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

Against this view, I argue that these problematic sympathies can be explained without reference to a special fictional attitude. Human morality is sensitive not only to abstract moral principles but also to the concrete motives and situations of an individual moral agent, and the motives and situations of the sympathetic antihero very often seem exculpatory.","[{""name"": ""Jens Kjeldgaard-Christiansen"", ""affiliation"": [""Postdoctoral Researcher, Department of English, Aarhus University, Denmark jkc@cc.au.dk""]}]","[""10.1038/415137a"", ""10.1037/gpr0000130"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.364"", ""10.1177/1461444816664356"", ""10.3389/fnins.2015.00301"", ""10.2307/2678446"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199656615.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1930297500004022"", ""10.1027/1864-1105/a000173"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.701"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2014.03.001"", ""10.1007/s13164-012-0106-3"", ""10.1177/0146167216659477"", ""10.1353/tyr.2011.0061"", ""10.1126/science.1161958"", ""10.1038/nrn2119"", ""10.1080/15388220.2014.954045"", ""10.1111/jaac.12036"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195111040.003.0005"", ""10.1093/joc/jqaa005"", ""10.1027/1864-1105/a000173"", ""10.1038/nrn2119"", ""10.1207/s15327957pspr0303_3"", ""10.1080/15205436.2012.690926"", ""10.12987/9780300159240"", ""10.1037/a0018963"", ""10.1177/0146167216659477"", ""10.2307/1225898"", ""10.1177/0093650217699934"", ""10.1177/1461444816664356"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.364"", ""10.1177/0093650217699934"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199656615.001.0001"", ""10.1093/screen/hjt004"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.2010.00204.x"", ""10.1215/03335372-7558136"", ""10.4159/9780674044463"", ""10.5406/pluralist.9.2.0001"", ""10.1016/S0022-1031(77)80008-5"", ""10.1080/15205436.2012.703285"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/68.1.27"", ""10.1080/15388220.2014.954045"", ""10.1126/science.1161958"", ""10.1080/0305724022014322"", ""10.1016/S0022-1031(77)80008-5"", ""10.1111/jaac.12036"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.2010.00204.x"", ""10.1037/h0023280"", ""10.1177/0956797616665813"", ""10.1207/s15327957pspr0303_3"", ""10.1037/h0023280"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/68.1.27"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195323252.003.0011"", ""10.1007/s13164-012-0106-3"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu027"", ""10.1016/0304-422X(94)00020-7"", ""10.1037/a0018963"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu027"", ""10.1111/jcom.12098"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135109"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135109"", ""10.1353/tyr.2011.0061"", ""10.2307/2678446"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195323252.003.0011"", ""10.1037/h0070405"", ""10.1177/1745691620904083"", ""10.1037/ppm0000152"", ""10.1111/jaac.12440"", ""10.1111/1467-6494.00086"", ""10.4159/9780674044463"", ""10.2307/2185873"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195320398.003.0003"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2011.10.005"", ""10.1038/415137a"", ""10.1037/gpr0000130"", ""10.1215/03335372-7558136"", ""10.2307/1225898"", ""10.1111/jaac.12440"", ""10.2307/2185873"", ""10.1016/0304-422X(94)00020-7"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01520.x"", ""10.1037/h0070405"", ""10.1080/15205436.2012.703285"", ""10.1177/1745691620904083"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac43.4.0385"", ""10.1525/9780520943919"", ""10.5406/pluralist.9.2.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2885.2004.tb00319.x"", ""10.1080/0305724022014322"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac43.4.0385"", ""10.1177/1745691614556679"", ""10.1093/joc/jqaa005"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2014.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2011.10.005"", ""10.1177/0956797616665813"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.701"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2885.2004.tb00319.x"", ""10.1037/ppm0000152"", ""10.3389/fnins.2015.00301"", ""10.1093/screen/hjt004"", ""10.1111/jcom.12098"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2020.101511"", ""10.1017/S1930297500004022"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195320398.003.0003"", ""10.1111/1467-6494.00086"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01520.x"", ""10.12987/9780300159240"", ""10.1525/9780520943919"", ""10.1080/15205436.2012.690926"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195111040.003.0005"", ""10.1177/1745691614556679"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2020.101511""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Gender Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

This transformative agenda met, however, some criticism and resistance from Eastern Partnership (EaP) countries. Russia’s full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022 changed profoundly the setting for these relations, including the accession requests coming from Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, along with the cut off of relations with Russia and Belarus. The implied debordering and rebordering dynamics taking place show the complexity of material and symbolic bordering practices. Through a critical border studies approach, this paper seeks to unpack these bordering dynamics and how they are reconfiguring the European space, arguing the EU has become locus of resistance for countries such as Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia assuring their European identity.","[{""name"": ""Maria Raquel Freire"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Coimbra, Portugal""]}]","[""10.3224/eris.v3i3.27340"", ""10.17502/mrcs.v10i2.561"", ""10.4324/9781315745411"", ""10.1080/14650045.2012.660579"", ""10.1080/14650045.2014.884561"", ""10.1080/14650040500318449"", ""10.1080/14782804.2015.1101266"", ""10.3917/eufor.385.0007"", ""10.1080/09557571.2012.678298"", ""10.1111/j.1478-9299.2007.00130.x"", ""10.14361/9783839431498-006"", ""10.1111/jcms.12448"", ""10.1080/14650045.2013.830106"", ""10.1177/0888325416673141"", ""10.1080/14650040500318415"", ""10.4000/belgeo.10532"", ""10.1017/S0260210500112045"", ""10.1080/08865655.2003.9695598"", ""10.1111/tesg.12422"", ""10.1080/14650045.2012.660582"", ""10.1080/14650045.2012.706111"", ""10.1017/S0260210510000586"", ""10.14361/transcript.9783839424421.21"", ""10.2478/mgr-2023-0011"", ""10.1080/03932720508457108"", ""10.1080/14650040500318522""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Her desire to learn and live beyond a conventional path sets her apart in a way that provides hope to a viewing audience that desires from her a myriad of things, including the intertwining of her reticence to marry, her close friendship with Penelope Featherington and intellectual aspirations with longed-for queer representation. This article will explore how the building of Eloise’s character allows for the exploration of the gendering of intellectual freedom on-screen at a place where fact, fiction and audience desires meet. In examining the translation of the complicated nature of the ‘thinking woman’ and ‘accomplishment’ onto screen through the lens of Eloise, and the references and language used, in particular those to Wollstonecraft, as well as audience responses to and desires for Eloise, this article will demonstrate how a conflation of historical reference and modern outlook both re-energizes and often polarizes feminist tropes of the scholarly woman.","[{""name"": ""Lizzie Rogers"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Researcher""]}]","[""10.1386/jptv_00091_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Religious studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'History']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

Textual analysis of Nicodemus Adai Patrick and John Iwuh’s is employed in exploring narrative techniques and formatting as indicators of the proportion of facts and fiction in a docufiction screenplay. It concludes that docufiction is a deliberate document with a mission in which the fact supplies the foundation on which fiction stands. Pre-knowledge of the embedded fact is primal to a deeper appreciation of a docufiction.

10.1093/adaptation/apaa015,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Reading Climate Change in the Palimpsest: The Ecocritical Potential of Novel-to-Film Adaptation,"AbstractThis essay theorizes the manifestation of the theme of climate change in the reception of novels and their film adaptations. To this end, I draw from and adapt Amitav Ghosh’s conception of textual hybridity: asserting that the era of climate change perhaps requires a movement beyond language to the image, which he believes is better capable of representing physical form, Ghosh prophesies that literature will evolve to incorporate hybrid forms that entwine text and image, such as the graphic novel. Drawing from Gérard Genette, as well as from various adaptation theorists’ descriptions of the doubled perception of an adaptation by audiences acquainted with its source text, I suggest a shift from Ghosh’s idea of hybrid creation to that of hybrid reception. I argue that the reception of a film adaptation of a novel as an adaptation, rather than as a standalone cinematic text, involves a palimpsest-like superimposition of literature and cinema—text and image—in the spectator’s mind, constituting a rich, hybrid experience that can potentially enhance the recipient’s perception of environmental issues in both texts involved. I demonstrate this theory via close readings of Suzanne Collins’s The Hunger Games trilogy and its film adaptations, and Cormac McCarthy’s The Road and its film adaptation, illustrating the various kinds of intertextual relationships that arise out of what I call palimpsestuous reading, and ultimately indicating the value of adaptation in an age of environmental crisis.","[{""name"": ""Nandita Mahajan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India""]}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226323176.001.0001"", ""10.51644/9781554589067"", ""10.1093/isle/15.2.1"", ""10.1353/chq.0.0932"", ""10.51644/9781771120036"", ""10.1515/9780791477175"", ""10.1093/isle/isw011"", ""10.3167/cs.2013.250206"", ""10.2307/j.ctt13x1r99"", ""10.1177/1470412907075066""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

He related them to each other and to caste, social classes, and capitalism. This article surveys Shaw's dramatic and nondramatic works, including prefaces, interviews, articles, and his novella The Black Girl in Search of God, to provide an overview of Shaw's views on racism (including his solution to this social evil) and to argue that his perspectives remain relevant to twenty-first-century struggles against it.","[{""name"": ""Bernard F.

10.1525/FQ.2021.74.4.56,FILM QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,REDEMPTION SONG: PERFORMING BLACK HISTORY AND MASCULINITY,"This article explores how Steve McQueen’s acclaimed 2020 pentalogy Small Axe (BBC) appears paradoxically to swerve away from Black British history in the very act of retrieving it. By examining key moments in Mangrove, Red, White and Blue, and Alex Wheatley, it argues that the constant tension between a push toward history and the pull of the aesthetic is the result of McQueen’s reformulation of “racial uplift” aesthetics that privileges exceptional acts over collective experience. Yet in striking contrast to his poetic license with history, McQueen presents Black masculinity and male self-expression within standard social and sexual norms. There are, however, more experimental, stylized moments in Small Axe where the historical and the aesthetic come together, notably in the highly physical dancing sequences of Lovers Rock. While not without limitations, such scenes reveal fresh, liberatory forms of Black space and time, and forge transformative and redemptive moments of Black reality.","[{""name"": ""James S.

It focuses on LAS's Juliet and Juliet, hailed as ‘female queer theatre’ despite being conservative gay, while discussing briefly in comparison Yohangza's Romeo and Juliet, decried as ‘anti-queer’ for all its queerness. Although the dream of a happy married life in Juliet and Juliet appears similar to the much-critiqued homonormativity, I defend it as a ‘gay utopian fantasy’ rooted in the predicament of Korean queers under the ideology of familism. Questioning the adequacy of Western-centric queer theory to explain Korean gay reality, I call for the need to develop alternative concepts and positive vocabularies to give voice to the lived experience and aspiration of sexual minorities in countries like Korea, for whom the post-gay era has not yet arrived.","[{""name"": ""YEEYON IM"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/9780822393337-035"", ""10.1215/9781478003366""]",['Social Sciences'],['Cultural Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"
10.1215/02705346-8359530,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Queer Film Settings as Sites of Resistance,"The following article investigates the origins and functions of particular settings in queer films by examining four examples from different national contexts: Shortbus (dir. John Cameron Mitchell, US, 2006), Weekend (dir. Andrew Haigh, UK, 2011), Stranger by the Lake (L’inconnu du lac, dir. Alain Guiraudie, France, 2013), and Tropical Malady (Sud pralad, dir. Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand, 2004). The textual analyses highlight a range of prevalent queer film settings, such as the road and nature, in which queer characters take refuge. The study aims to identify a transnational countercultural stance in various uses of setting by concentrating on the notion of escape in a theoretical framework that draws on the work of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, José Muñoz, and Marc Augé. In the context of the study, the production of alternative spaces in queer cinema is treated as a revolutionary practice that challenges homophobia and heteronormativity, which sometimes coexist with class inequality and racism. The discussion finally suggests that there is a social critique of civilization behind the escapism and pessimism, as well as utopianism, in queer cinema.","[{""name"": ""Serdar Küçük"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Cultural Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

10.7146/nts.v32i1.120406,NORDIC THEATRE STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Producing Bare Life in the Anthropo-scene,"The article discusses the notion of the Anthropocene as a kind of anthropological machine, closely related to the regime of visuality. Giorgio Agamben points out that the anthropological machine is always an optical machine, which helps to induce visibility as an essential element of power. Similarly, Nicholas Mirzoeff discusses Anthropocene visuality as a technique which is always hierarchical and autocratic, helping to maintain the visualizer’s material power. Mirzoeff suggests that the biopolitical effects of visuality can be confronted by “countervisuality”, a strategy, which abandons visuality in order to achieve political equality. However, in this article I will argue that Anthropocene visuality should not be abandoned but rather reversed or redirected. In this regard, reversed visuality would mean not the replacement of the aesthetic with the political, but, on the contrary, the replacement of anthropocentric aesthetics with a different kind of aesthetics, which includes a non-human or not-quitehuman gaze. If Anthropocene visuality silently presumes that the place from which it represents will remain forever intact, then post-Anthropocene visuality demonstrates that the mechanisms of exclusion and subjection are easily interchangeable and that every living being can potentially bec ome “bare life”.","[{""name"": ""Audronė Žukauskaitė"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Cultural Studies', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

Against this background, the paper investigates the relationship between illiberalism and various political and social factors in Romania, taking into account a particular context (the Russian invasion in Ukraine). Romania has experienced a rise in illiberal attitudes and the spread of populist and nationalist rhetoric, which is particularly concerning given its strategic location as a member of the European Union and NATO, and its proximity to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. This study aims to investigate the associations between various attitudes, news consumption habits, and perceived exposure to misinformation, and how these factors relate to levels of illiberalism in Romanian society. Given the increasing prominence of illiberal and populist ideologies globally, a nuanced understanding of these relationships is critical. The study employs a quantitative approach, leveraging an online survey to collect data from a sample of 1000 Romanian citizens. Soft quotas were used to ensure a diverse representation across age, gender, and education levels. Data collection was carried out by Dynata, a globally recognized market research firm, between March 1–9, 2022. Our analysis, informed by multiple regression models, uncovers complex relationships between trust in institutions, attitudes towards Russia and Ukraine, news consumption habits, perceived misinformation, and demographic factors in shaping illiberal perspectives.

She contends that by placing animal characters (raven and pigs) in close interaction with humans, Pasolini encouraged viewers to explore and overcome the human–animal divide. In doing so, he aimed to expose the faulty binary premises of Marxist ideology and construct a posthumanist identity that recognized the illusory separation between body and mind, and between the human and its related others. Drawing on concepts such as Marchesini’s ‘mimesis’, Cronin’s ‘tradosphere’, Nancy’s ‘co-ontology’ and Braidotti’s ‘becoming animal’, this article shows how Pasolini considers an exit from anthropocentrism and human exceptionalism via trans-species solidarity. Eventually, in Pigsty, animality turns into a metaphor for all alterity. As humans are silenced by pigs, a new powerful language of ‘otherness’ gives birth to the posthuman human.","[{""name"": ""Enrica Maria Ferrara"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369705 Trinity College Dublin""]}]","[""10.1086/345321"", ""10.1057/9781137430328_2"", ""10.1080/00751634.2018.1414374"", ""10.1093/screen/hjx014"", ""10.1386/jicms.7.1.35_1"", ""10.1386/jicms_00100_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

The present paper explores Watchmen’s deep resonances with contemporary social and political issues, not only at the level of representations, but also at the series’ production context, and argues that the show marks a key moment in the politicization of the superhero genre.","[{""name"": ""Evdokia Stefanopoulou"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Cultural Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

Germany's first agitprop troupes formed within youth clubs affiliated with the Communist Party (KPD) around 1925, but the movement quickly grew beyond established club culture, with troupes sprouting up “like mushrooms,” as one critic of the period put it. By 1929 police estimated there were about two hundred self-proclaimed agitprop troupes spread across Germany, all pursuing a transparently aggressive political agenda: to turn the theatre into a site of revolutionary class struggle. If the Weimar period saw an unprecedented mixing of art and politics, agitprop took this tendency to the extreme by declaring theatre to be a weapon in the hands of the proletariat.

Pinter's poetry, however, is often sidestepped, with critics generally regarding it as lacking the deftness of his drama. Following on from Basil Chiasson in The Late Harold Pinter: Political Dramatist, Poet and Activist (2017), this article focuses on Pinter's often neglected poetic works. It reads Pinter's poetry in the context of the Cold War, Gulf War, and Iraq War to unpick the political resonances within poems such as “Partners” (1985), “American Football” (1991), “Don't Look” (1995), and “God Bless America” (2003).

10.1093/adaptation/apz034,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Picturing Charlotte Bronte's Artistic Rebellion? Myths of the Woman Artist in Postfeminist Jane Eyre Screen Adaptations,"AbstractCharlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre: An Autobiography (1847) has been regularly adapted for the screen since the silent era. During the 1990s, a trend emerged in which cinematic and television versions of Brontë’s novel paid increased attention to the protagonists’ identities as amateur artists. To explain this phenomenon, this article examines Jane Eyre (Franco Zeffirelli, 1996), Jane Eyre (ITV/A&amp;E, 1997), Jane Eyre (BBC, 2006), and Jane Eyre (Cary Fukunaga, 2011). It proposes that these productions contribute to the evolution of Brontë’s authorial mythology by heightening their heroines’ similarities with the writer, another amateur artist. In so doing, these adaptations benefit from the reputations of Brontë and her work as rebelliously feminist. Nevertheless, these women artists’ rebellions are distinctly postfeminist. To demonstrate its argument, the article contextualizes contemporary Jane Eyre adaptations within their postfeminist cultural landscape. Postfeminism, however, is a contested term. Hence, this analysis participates in broader debates that interrogate postfeminism as a concept and its persistent fascination with nineteenth-century creative women. Through comparisons of the adaptations, this article will delineate the development of the woman artist trope to reveal how postfeminist conceptualizations of women’s creativity have shifted since the 1990s. In particular, the woman artist displays an increased desire to ‘return home’. Such retreatist narratives exploit but also obscure the fact that Brontë has long signified the perceived tension between traditional, highly domestic female gender roles and women’s creativity. As such, these postfeminist adaptations have a shaping effect on the myths that continue to circulate about Brontë’s feminism and authorship.","[{""name"": ""Catherine Paula Han"", ""affiliation"": [""Cardiff University""]}]","[""10.2307/2933671"", ""10.1057/9780230582415"", ""10.1080/14680777.2011.652143"", ""10.1057/9780230294523_19"", ""10.1057/9781137317230_10"", ""10.1002/9781118405543.ch31"", ""10.1057/9781137315878"", ""10.7228/manchester/9781784992460.003.0011"", ""10.1177/1367549415585555"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apw043"", ""10.1080/14748932.2018.1389004"", ""10.1177/1367549417733003"", ""10.1177/1367549407075898"", ""10.1080/14680777.2016.1193293"", ""10.5040/9781474271424"", ""10.1057/9781137317230_3"", ""10.1179/1474893214Z.000000000116"", ""10.7560/706453"", ""10.1086/493822"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748611478.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781351175463-1"", ""10.1353/crt.2004.0001"", ""10.1179/147489311X12962076043363"", ""10.1177/1464700108095850"", ""10.4324/9780203869000"", ""10.1017/9781108599504.007"", ""10.1515/9781400833252"", ""10.1093/adaptation/aps019"", ""10.1057/9781137273482"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64559-9"", ""10.3138/9781442686748"", ""10.1057/9781137405159"", ""10.7228/manchester/9781784992460.003.0001"", ""10.1163/9789401204477"", ""10.1057/9781137262875"", ""10.1086/448328"", ""10.1353/cj.2005.0012"", ""10.1215/9780822376538-005"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_426536"", ""10.1515/9780748632084"", ""10.35360/njes.234"", ""10.1179/174582208X298644"", ""10.1002/9781118405543.ch30"", ""10.1093/owc/9780199556069.003.0021"", ""10.1163/9789401204477_016"", ""10.1080/09699082.2018.1510940"", ""10.1002/9781118405543.ch15""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Gender Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

By juxtaposing trans-cultural media and simulacra, among other performance elements, the Wooster Group compelled spectators to engage with how, at the time of its original composition, Pinter raised questions of alterity, identity, and displacement as the United Kingdom was experiencing a demographic shift that challenged then-contemporary racist and masculinist definitions of the “human.” Additionally, The Wooster Group engaged with various aspects of post-humanism through embodied performance: the performers use prosthetic technologies to expose how characters express or fail to manifest agency, and incorporate various trans-cultural aesthetic sources as well as a strict and unconventionally literal adherence to the source text to underscore the distributed nature of selfhood. I suggest that these features of The Room can be brought to bear on more contemporary examples of racism, misogyny, xenophobia, and classism and might be staged to speak to recent social movements, including Black Lives Matter.","[{""name"": ""Serap Erincin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2979/jmodelite.35.4.163"", ""10.1057/9780230589841"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-20561-5"", ""10.1017/S0266464X21000269"", ""10.4324/9780203641989"", ""10.3366/jobs.2018.0239"", ""10.1163/18757405-023001024"", ""10.1080/13528165.2019.1641322"", ""10.1163/18757405-03202005"", ""10.5040/9781350059511"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226321394.001.0001"", ""10.2979/jmodelite.36.3.100"", ""10.1163/18757405-024001007"", ""10.1353/tj.2016.0077"", ""10.4324/9780203088104"", ""10.4324/9780203994610"", ""10.2307/1125196"", ""10.5040/9781408175293""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Cultural Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"

I claim that the culture privileges masculinity and necessitates heteronormal performances in order for students to participate.

Voyeurism, extended takes, and unstable points of identification create an ethical crisis for the viewer, who is left questioning the mechanics, and the limits, of empathy. The film offers a sensory bounty: tactile images, pastoral greenery, and heightened sounds. These surface-rich images in particular function in dialogue with a history of Holocaust cinema, complicating already vexing questions of cultural memory and political framing. And the pointed focus on the administration of fascism within the home exposes both the domestic implementation of a “blood and soil” ideology, and the ways in which intimacy and proximity can both uphold and erode the frameworks of war.","[{""name"": ""Amy Herzog"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Although cinema played a secondary role in the 2019 protests compared to digital media, numerous intertextual linkages demonstrate the productive potential of considering the two together. Special attention is given to the cops-and-robbers genre, a linchpin in local film history and a frequent form of choice for Hong Kong-mainland China coproductions. While the troubled representation of police in 2019 and beyond suggests that the future of the genre is unstable, the ingenuity of recent digital media demonstrates Hong Kong’s enduring potential for moving image innovation.","[{""name"": ""Cameron L.

This article re-interprets the phenomenon of insecurity by reading it together with Heidegger’s analytic of time as a function of our proximity to being as fundamental ontological question, one which unfolds in the form of a threatening future.","[{""name"": ""J Peter Burgess"", ""affiliation"": [""Ecole normale supérieure, Paris""]}]","[""10.4324/9781315883700"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000111"", ""10.1353/nlh.2015.0025"", ""10.4324/9780203828946"", ""10.1177/0967010618814721"", ""10.4324/9780203965702"", ""10.4324/9780203288771"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511840470"", ""10.1215/9780822386551"", ""10.1177/0305829818771349"", ""10.1177/0020852314543210"", ""10.7765/9781847792181"", ""10.4324/9780203962596"", ""10.1080/2158379X.2018.1523319"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogz040"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226668253.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190865511.001.0001"", ""10.1080/095023800334995"", ""10.4324/9780203852613"", ""10.2307/2600573"", ""10.1515/9780822378334"", ""10.1111/isqu.12091"", ""10.1177/0305829818773088""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

One-to-one interaction between performers and audience members results in highly flexible performances that respond to physical and auditory input from individual audience members, through which performers curate customized multisensory experiences that communicate the production's theatrical world to its audience. Given this reliance on close-up interaction, the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have posed a particular challenge for sensory theatre makers. In in-person sensory theatre, performers focus on neurodivergent audience members, with parents and paid carers often taking a (literal) back seat, but remotely delivered sensory theatre during COVID-19 hinges on the carer's facilitation of sensory engagement curated by sensory theatre practitioners. Oily Cart, a pioneering London-based sensory theatre company, responded to COVID-19 restrictions with a season of work presented in various formats in audiences’ homes, and their production Space to Be marked a shift in the company's audience engagement to include an emphasis on the carer's experience.1 Using this production as a case study, I argue that the pivotal role adopted by carers during the pandemic has the potential to shape future in-person productions, moving practitioners toward a more holistic, neurodiverse audience experience that challenges a disabled–nondisabled binary by embracing carers’ experiences alongside those of neurodivergent audience members.2","[{""name"": ""Alison M.

Sniadecki, 2017), focusing on the migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. El Mar La Mar is one of several recent films that use unconventional textual strategies to approach the subject of migration. Eschewing exposition altogether, it draws attention to the Sonoran Desert, a vast territory that in the last twenty-five years has become a deadly route for migrants trying to cross the border. Unlike what has often been argued about the film, though, El Mar La Mar does not produce an immersive viewing experience. Nor does it simply rely on observational strategies. Instead, it creates an uneasy sense of place out of unexpected juxtapositions of sound and image. Drawing on human geography and sound studies in documentary, this essay looks at how the film's textual strategies align place and politics in order to evoke the migrant crisis.","[{""name"": ""Vinicius Navarro"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Communication'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

However, when we find these maxims flouted by outsourced interpreters working in trials in Barcelona, the observed practices may be considered non-standard and yet constitute an expected and even accepted social practice. Here we attempt to understand why interpreters sometimes abandon all illusion of equivalence, why side conversations occur in certain hearings, and why interpreters sometimes speak in their own voice, becoming direct participants in discursive exchanges. Risk analysis enables us to model ways in which these practices can ensure that cooperation is achieved and time is not wasted. In one case study, side conversations between the defendant and the interpreter serve to inform the defendant of the possible consequences of a plea. Such a practice nevertheless requires that the officers of the court trust interpreters to exceptionally high degrees. In a second case study, disagreements between the judge and the interpreter, technically over issues of translation equivalence, lead to distrust in the interpreter to the point where cooperation becomes impossible. In this instance, a non-standard practice that might be efficient elsewhere leads to communicative failure. It is thus found that non-standard interpreting can be efficient when the participants’ risk-management strategies are aligned and trust is operative; on the other hand, it can also convert trivial differences into high-stakes disputes that throw risk-management strategies out of alignment.","[{""name"": ""Anthony Pym"", ""affiliation"": [""Universitat Rovira i Virgili""]}, {""name"": ""Judith Raigal-Aran"", ""affiliation"": [""Universitat Rovira i Virgili""]}, {""name"": ""Carmen Bestué Salinas"", ""affiliation"": [""Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona""]}]","[""10.1075/tis.00023.aru"", ""10.24989/fs.v41i3-4.1736"", ""10.1075/babel.63.2.02che"", ""10.1075/btl.53"", ""10.1075/btl.31.07poc"", ""10.7202/003847ar"", ""10.1075/target.16.1.02pym"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2015.06.010"", ""10.1075/btl.122.10pym"", ""10.1556/084.2018.19.1.1"", ""10.1075/babel.00103.var"", ""10.7202/011009ar""]","['Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Pharmacy', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('1007 药学', 0.7325), ('1008 中药学', 0.7122)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

10.3366/film.2020.0136,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,New Sincerity and Frances Ha in Light of Sartre: A Proposal for an Existentialist Conceptual Framework,"There is a growing discourse on “new sincerity,” and related terms like “quirky” and “metamodernism,” as a movement or sensibility in contemporary cinema developing from the late 1990s onward, exemplified by the work of filmmakers such as Wes Anderson and Charlie Kaufman. However, what this new concept means in the context of cinema has so far remained under-defined and requires further philosophical analysis. This article provides such an analysis by offering a reconceptualization of Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist-phenomenological notions of good faith and sincerity, which will be connected to developments in film and elaborated in relation to Frances Ha (Noah Baumbach, 2012). I propose, against Sartre's own preference for the problematic term “authenticity,” to understand sincerity as the reflective resumption of good faith's pre-reflective acceptance of human-reality. This conception of sincerity as reflective allows us to accurately understand the combination of self-awareness and affirmation that characterizes new sincerity cinema: its self-awareness does not serve the postmodernist strategy of endless self-ironization; instead, its portrayals affirm the meaningfulness of its filmic reality, while also being aware of film as a medium. An analysis of Frances Ha illustrates how this concept of sincerity might be seen to function both on the level of story world, characters and themes, and on that of narrative structure and audio-visual style, thereby showing how we can meaningfully speak of sincerity in and of film.","[{""name"": ""Allard den Dulk"", ""affiliation"": [""Amsterdam University College""]}]","[""10.1080/17400309.2011.640888"", ""10.5040/9798400699429"", ""10.4324/9781315643595"", ""10.1525/9780520915169"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748620340.003.0005"", ""10.1093/screen/43.4.349"", ""10.5040/9781350115644.ch-013"", ""10.1515/9780691213279"", ""10.1515/9781503627017"", ""10.3402/jac.v2i0.5677""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

A corpus analysis of Krzysztof Bosak's (de)legitimation strategies on twitter,"The article discusses (de)legitimation strategies of Krzysztof Bosak, one of the leaders of the Confederation Liberty and Independence, a Polish coalition of right-wing movements. The success of the formation appears to be in line with that of other European (far) right-wing parties, which have become politically relevant in recent decades. Despite the Confederation’s growing position in European politics, there is a paucity of research devoted to the party. The present paper attempts to bridge the gap by focusing on Bosak’s 2020 presidential campaign and the politician’s use of Twitter. In order to investigate Bosak’s discourse in detail, corpus linguistic methods were used.

To do so, we look at the case of Colombia’s prolific web series production, undertaken by professional and amateur producers and promoted by institutional and educational programmes. This research analyses the structure of 26 productions (thirteen professional, thirteen amateur) using a mixed-methods approach and an exploratory-descriptive scope. It uses analytical tools created inspired by narratology. Specifically, it offers data that allow us to develop the definition of web series: characteristics of their plots, characters, aspects of narration (time, mood, voice) and forms of endings. The results indicate that Colombian web series mostly present traditional serialized narrative structures and plot simplicity. They have linear, chronological and elliptical narratives developed in the present tense. They also tend to tell a single narrative, albeit through different stories, and leave open endings. Finally, there are only slight differences in these aspects between the two types of producers. These results, based on a specific geographical and industrial context, contribute to knowledge of web series form and its relationship to conventional serialized fiction.","[{""name"": ""Diego F.

Miss Littlewood’s plot reveals details of Littlewood’s life and work, while its form mirrors the montage techniques that she pioneered in Britain. The article uses interviews and rehearsal observations to document aspects of the process by which Miss Littlewood was developed. It reflects on the tensions that are revealed between that relatively luxurious process and Littlewood’s political and financial realities. Ethnography was an ideal method for documenting this process because it facilitated observation of relationships between the various works and demonstrated the fluidity and creativity of academic writing.","[{""name"": ""Millie Taylor"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000094222878 University of Winchester""]}]","[""10.1353/anq.2006.0004"", ""10.1386/smt_00019_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Music']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Apologists for the metaverses argue that soon the Internet will cease to exist in the usual sense, and its place will be taken by the metaverses as global virtual spaces for communication, work, and leisure. This vision is compared with the concept of the Panopticon, formulated by Jeremy Bentham and subsequently interpreted by Michel Foucault. The growing dependence of the state, the society, and the individual on technology and their increasing interconnection forms a set of problems with an ever increasing acuteness, yet no obvious solution has been found so far. The article demonstrates how technology manipulates human weaknesses, increasing its power and gaining control over society. Among the major risks related to the metaverses are the decay of values and morality in the virtual world, and the collapse of the individual’s identity. Possible scenarios of interaction between human and technology are illustrated by Tarkovsky’s Solaris, Cronenberg’s Videodrome, and Folman’s Congress. The study ends with an assumption that a new socio-humanitarian rationality must be formed to enable control over the logic of the development of tech companies promoting the metaverses.","[{""name"": ""OLEG N.

10.1215/02705346-8631547,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Masturbatory Ecologies: Pornography, Ecosexuality, and Perverted Environmental Justice","This essay considers how environmentalism can be interwoven with discourses of sexuality and the ways in which sexuality can participate in environmental justice movements. By thinking with provocative, erotic media that highlight environmental degradation, it marries investigations of ecological crisis at the hands of deforestation and porn studies with two aims. First, it highlights the fraught relationship a pornographic video aggregator like Pornhub might share with feminist and queer epistemologies. Second, it emphasizes the ecosexual nature of environmental justice by way of Pornhub’s Give America Wood initiative (2014) and the documentary Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story (2014). While Goodbye Gauley Mountain and Pornhub are incommensurate in many ways, together they demonstrate how masturbatory ecologies enable a relationship with the environment that can be both active, as in the film’s offering, and passive, as with Pornhub’s, and thus constitute a “perverted” environmental justice through the experience and demonstration of sexuality. A perverted environmental justice envisions a broader framework that recognizes the potential to actively and passively participate in environmental social justice while also enfolding the environment into sexual arrangements. “Masturbatory ecologies” thus signifies a self-gratifying mode of environmentalism that harnesses the self, the body, and the erotic to foster positive environmental world building in apocalyptic times.","[{""name"": ""Jeremy Chow"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

I argue that these objects reflect a unique engagement with the materiality of film décor, which makes use of the strong presence of objects to portray intimacy as the site of inconclusive meaning. By examining both films together, I demonstrate how the world of inanimate objects brings erotic undertones to the surface while challenging the material conditions of the erotic itself. In order to do so, I examine the ways in which Lubitsch relies on material details not only as functional narrative devices, but as elements that challenge and complicate our interpretations of familiar things. While the underacknowledged use of objects in The Marriage Circle illustrates the logic of displacement that stands at the center of the director’s style, Trouble in Paradise provides a framework for recognizing the critical role of objects in the structure of desire in his films. This article sets up a new reading of tactility and materiality in Lubitsch’s use of mise en scéne and seeks to give objects a prominent role in the analysis of his style.","[{""name"": ""Noa Merkin"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Chicago""]}]","[""10.1515/9780691249247"", ""10.5040/9781350251991"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-14428-0_27"", ""10.1086/449043""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

In examining these transgressive effects of home video, this article simultaneously traces the factors, ranging from socialist cultural doctrines to the conditions of shortage economies and distinctive screen translation practices, that contributed to legitimation of emerging video cultures within the Soviet project.","[{""name"": ""Iuliia Glushneva"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

One of the more prominent and reliable methodologies used to assess leader personality through leader speech is Leader Trait Analysis (LTA), developed by Margaret Hermann. However, because LTA was developed using English language vocabulary and grammar, its accuracy using Russian language speeches to discern leader personality traits has relied on translation. Translation is both inefficient and may not accurately transfer the semantics of speech upon which LTA’s results depend. Responding to this issue, this paper applies Mona Baker’s translation studies criteria to qualitatively compare the semantic equivalence, or maintenance of a text’s original meaning, between English translations used to create an LTA profile for Vladimir Putin and Putin’s original Russian speeches. The research identifies the preponderance of grammatical differences between English and Russian in limiting how well English translations of Russian speech maintain semantic equivalence relevant to assessing leader personality. It is concluded that an accurate understanding of Russian leaders’ personalities requires Russian language specific LTA profiling.","[{""name"": ""Katherine Hallin"", ""affiliation"": [""University of St Andrews School of International Relations, St Andrews, UK"", ""University of St. Andrew's school of Modern Languages, St Andrews, UK""]}]","[""10.1111/1521-9488.00238"", ""10.1080/13642987.2017.1383240"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1127277"", ""10.1093/isr/viaa001"", ""10.1080/09668136.2020.1749566"", ""10.1162/01622880151091916"", ""10.1093/isp/ekaa016"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000219"", ""10.1057/jird.2014.31"", ""10.1111/pops.12333"", ""10.1177/0022002703261053"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00206"", ""10.1093/pa/gss007"", ""10.1080/02684527.2017.1313523"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00006.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00903.x"", ""10.1111/fpa.12019"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37763-2"", ""10.1111/1467-856X.00110"", ""10.1177/014616728063002"", ""10.2307/2600126"", ""10.1111/1521-9488.5020012"", ""10.1111/misr.12213"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00447.x"", ""10.1080/14683849.2019.1575735"", ""10.1145/2635648.2635657"", ""10.1145/2635648.2635657"", ""10.1515/lingvan-2015-1004"", ""10.1080/13600826.2016.1269056"", ""10.1111/modl.12177"", ""10.1007/s11185-018-9196-6"", ""10.1177/1369148120910984"", ""10.1177/2053168014558970"", ""10.1080/13537121.2015.1111638"", ""10.2307/412307"", ""10.1162/isec.2009.34.2.119"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199653881.013.032"", ""10.1093/fpa/orac008"", ""10.1057/9781403983497_2"", ""10.4324/9781003131021"", ""10.4324/9781003131021"", ""10.2307/2600414"", ""10.1111/pops.12206"", ""10.1111/lnc3.12364"", ""10.1093/isq/sqab083"", ""10.2307/3791696"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511612183"", ""10.1177/0192512117694481"", ""10.5539/jpl.v13n1p123"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00852.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

I critically examine Herzog’s interpretation of Kant’s sublime and the relations he establishes between the sublime and his own key aesthetic notion of ecstatic truth. I examine how the sublime in Herzog’s films arises from encounters with the overwhelming force and power of nature experienced by his characters in the feature films and participants in the documentaries. I question whether Kant’s conception of the sublime is the one that best aligns with Herzog’s aesthetic aims and I contrast Kant’s transcendental sublime with what I describe as the physiological sublime of Edmund Burke. I draw some conclusions about the moral dimension of the sublime in the context of the relationship between humans and nature within the frame of contemporary ecological concerns.,"[{""name"": ""Patrícia Castello Branco"", ""affiliation"": [""New University of Lisbon""]}]","[""10.5749/minnesota/9780816677634.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139018098"", ""10.1002/9781118274491.ch14"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511576492"", ""10.5040/9781350091696"", ""10.1002/9781118274491.ch11"", ""10.1017/9781782046905"", ""10.3366/film.2007.0018"", ""10.1080/10509208.2003.10555038"", ""10.1353/jhi.2001.0018""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This transnational masculinity is repeatedly coupled with fantasies and anxieties about the environment – the toxic, as Mel Chen suggests, is animate, weaving in and out of containers, bodies and borders, allowing it to threaten Italian bodies (toxic waste, garbage, the 'ecomafia' of the South), and allowing us to imagine that it might bestow on those same bodies the strength, vitality and power to resist the toxic. Ultimately, these toxic and transnational male bodies may be always from elsewhere, but strangely Italian, too – after all, Esposito argues that the hallmark of Italian thought is precisely a refusal of the idea of a stable and strong national identity.","[{""name"": ""Robert A.

As such, the essay offers several different approaches to thinking about media adaptation in the age of global warming, drawing variously from sociologists, political ecologists, film theorists, and designers.","[{""name"": ""Kyle Meikle"", ""affiliation"": [""Klein Family School of Communications Design, University of Baltimore""]}]","[""10.3998/mij.15031809.0006.101"", ""10.1215/00382876-3749271"", ""10.4324/9781315165448-15"", ""10.1353/nlh.2007.0038"", ""10.5040/9781474221702"", ""10.4324/9781315690254"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190696771.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9781137399021"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479844401.003.0006"", ""10.1002/9781118312032"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apt015"", ""10.4324/9780203807125"", ""10.1353/cj.2019.0006""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

This article seeks to examine the public perception and challenges facing investigative journalism in Africa. It uses the case of an investigative journalist called Anas from Ghana whose works have sought to expose corruption in the country and the continent. The article adopts a mixed-method approach that relies on descriptive, quantitative research design (basic numeral) based on an online survey from June to July 2019 (n = 208 respondents) and an in-depth analysis of existing literature. The objective of this study is to interrogate the role of journalists in combating corruption, a vice that continues to pose a serious threat to justice and development in many societies. The authors find that investigative journalism is attractive to many citizens but faces serious challenges that undermine its effectiveness. The article concludes with a set of recommendations that can further strengthen the practice of investigative journalism.","[{""name"": ""Gershon Dagba"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121875445 University of Duisburg-Essen""]}, {""name"": ""Prince Opoku"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012222680X Hope College""]}, {""name"": ""Mark Opoku Amankwa"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000403894302 Edith Cowan University""]}, {""name"": ""Israel Nyaburi Nyadera"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000104314443 Egerton University""]}]","[""10.4314/ljh.v28i1.1"", ""10.1177/0021909619826339"", ""10.1080/00207659.2021.1881871"", ""10.2979/reseafrilite.49.3.08"", ""10.1257/aer.96.3.720"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2018.1494515"", ""10.1017/S2071832200019684"", ""10.1177/000203971605100304"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2010.512502"", ""10.1177/1464884915597159"", ""10.1080/14702436.2014.999476"", ""10.1177/1464884907081048"", ""10.1177/0020872820944997"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2019.1664928"", ""10.1080/14680777.2018.1447352"", ""10.1080/02560054.2009.9653400"", ""10.1386/jams_00083_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Deeply informed by the pursuit of intimate connections, her practice fosters reflection on how we modulate our sense of selfhood through interactions with others. This article examines Sobell’s video performances with chicken carcasses, instantiating the ambiguities of mother- infant relationships, in connection with her Brainwave Drawings, a series of installations based on biofeedback that unveils reciprocal influences between art participants’ psychic states. Even though these sets of works were developed during the same time frame (1974–82) and are equally concerned with bodily communication, they are almost never interpreted as conceptually related. Underscoring their mutual affiliation with a feminist agenda, this article argues that these works are deeply intertwined at the level of their interrogation of socially sanctioned forms of interaction. Embracing the dynamics of open systems, Sobell cultivates fluid forms of communication and exposes the invisible threads that connect us to others. She relies on technological mediation in order to advance a more complex understanding of the biological and social underpinnings of selfhood. Sobell’s works invite viewers to consider interpersonal exchanges that surpass linguistic forms of communication and reveal the porous thresholds between body and mind, self and other, nature and culture.","[{""name"": ""Cristina Albu"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Computer Science Applications', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

In Sweden, this represents an interesting and perhaps provoking twist, as the hegemony of classical music in music teacher education has since long been replaced by the hegemony of popular music. Based on fieldwork during the implementation of El Sistema in Malmö, the most multicultural town in Sweden, this chapter analyses El Sistema through the concept of habitus crises, an important ingredient in the development of intercultural pedagogic competencies. Through the understanding of El Sistema as a glocal phenomenon, the potential of the El Sistema intervention is discussed. The discussion is framed by a mapping of the tension fields that El Sistema teachers are navigating. The experiences of the El Sistema teachers in Malmö point towards a music teacher training that actively prepares for teaching in segregated, multi-cultural and socio-economic vulnerable areas. The chapter concludes with suggestions for future music teacher training in interacting ethnospaces: stimulating habitus crises and promoting transformative learning.","[{""name"": ""Eva Sæther"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9781503621749"", ""10.1111/1467-954X.12280"", ""10.1017/S0265051709990179"", ""10.1177/0255761406065471"", ""10.1080/14613808.2012.685460"", ""10.1017/S0265051710000203"", ""10.2979/philmusieducrevi.24.2.01"", ""10.1080/14613800802079056"", ""10.13189/cea.2014.020305"", ""10.1080/23311886.2016.1149915"", ""10.1177/1368431015605443"", ""10.1080/00405840701764789"", ""10.1111/0893-7850.00231"", ""10.9783/9780812203134"", ""10.1177/0255761406065472""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Education', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Environment and Ideology in the Educational Films Made between 1955 and 1989 by the Hungarian Ministry of Interior's Film Studio,"Abstract Analysing the output of the Hungarian Ministry of Interior’s own film studio, which produced educational films between 1955 and 1989, this essay investigates the modes in which the border zone was represented during the decades of state socialism. Considering the vicinity of the border as an area, where ideological confrontations are battled out, the article argues that there is a significant difference between the films produced in the 1950-60s, and those from the mid-1960s onwards. The earlier pieces depict an emotionally charged border zone the defence of which is a social-political duty: father-type superiors teach rookie soldiers about this obligation in coming-of-age stories. However, from the mid-1960s onwards, the films seem to confine themselves to an instrumental mode of persuasion, which presents border protection as a merely technical question. The article briefly ties these shifts to the changing modes in official discourses during the decades of state socialist Hungary.","[{""name"": ""László Strausz"", ""affiliation"": [""Eötvös Loránd University ( Budapest , Hungary )""]}]","[""10.1515/9780822394167"", ""10.1386/seec.3.2.175_1"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-92498-1"", ""10.5117/9789089640130"", ""10.5040/9781350987944""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

While a regional and national frame is the focus of cultural policy in relation to film audience development in the UK, our analysis examines relational, localised and sub-regional film cultures in order to understand how differing levels of film exhibition influence people's sense of place. This is framed within a discussion of cultural inequality more generally. In the UK, questions of engagement with different types of film exhibition have gained greater prominence recently, but there has been limited attention paid to how audiences understand their geographic relationship with film exhibition. Drawing on 200 semi-structured, qualitative interviews with a wide range of film viewers across four English regions, the North East, North West, South West and Yorkshire and the Humber, we assess perceptions of film exhibition in these regions. In doing so, we characterise five different modes of place in relation to the breadth of film exhibition, from distinctive film cities to mainstream multiplex towns. In particular, we focus on how access to film is simultaneously narrated through both localised proximity to cinemas of different types and virtual access to film through online platforms. This work provides further evidence of the uneven provision of diverse film in England but shows how film audiences relationally interpret their engagement within film as a cultural form.","[{""name"": ""Peter Merrington"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthew Hanchard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bridgette Wessels"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1329878X1113900111"", ""10.3366/JBCTV.2005.2.2.343"", ""10.1386/macp.11.1.3_1"", ""10.1068/a3756"", ""10.1080/09548963.2019.1644795"", ""10.1080/09548963.2013.783174"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2007.4.2.370"", ""10.1080/0954896042000267134"", ""10.1068/a3522"", ""10.1080/17411548.2016.1268804"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2010.0006"", ""10.1177/1350508416689094"", ""10.1080/09548963.2019.1617934"", ""10.1177/1461444818822816"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2017.0386"", ""10.1386/jmpr.10.1.39_1"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2012.0065"", ""10.1080/14682753.2015.1015802"", ""10.1080/01439685.2019.1600905"", ""10.1179/jrl.2005.1.2.52"", ""10.1057/9781137388155_11""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Urban Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

VAL DEL OMAR'S MEDIA ART (""APANORAMIC IMAGE OVERFLOW"", ""DIAPHONY"", ""TACTILE VISION"") AS AN EXPRESSION OF HIS CONCEPT OF ""MECHANICAL MYSTICISM""","The article analyzes three media technologies for creating an immersive polysensory environment, developed back in 1940–1960s by the Spanish film director and engineer Jose Val del Omar. The technologies are considered in the context of the director’s key concept, which he called “mechanical mysticism”. It was aimed at creating a cinematic analogy of mystical experience by transforming the mysticism of Spanish culture into cinematic technologies. The author reveals how the conversion of the suggestive artistic potential of Spanish mysticism into the immersiveness of film technologies allowed J. Val del Omar to create art spaces that took the system of illusions beyond the visual into special modes of psychological experiences. On the example of his films (Water- Mirror of Granada, 1955, and Fire in Castile, 1961), the author analyzes the originality of the engineering solutions of J. Val del Omar’s technologies, defines the strategies of immersiveness and their rootedness in Spanish mysticism, qualifies the aesthetic impact of these media technologies on viewers. The article demonstrates that immersiveness is achieved by using a shock strategy of interlacing the effects of suggestiveness and defamiliarization (“ostranenie”), as well as through the expansion of the range of the viewer’s sensory perception and the effect of synesthesia. The suggestive impression effect is enhanced by visual poetic metaphors that reveal to the viewers the historically formed sensual imagery of Spanish mysticism. With the help of optical and light technologies, the semantic field of a film is not only visualized, but also illusively materialized as a three-dimensional image. НАУКА ТЕЛЕВИДЕНИЯ № 17.1, 2021 54 THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TELEVISION In general, the strategies reproduce the sensual immersiveness, which is inherent in the Spanish Catholic cultural experience. Such strategies block the viewers’ psychological distancing mechanisms and cause affective states and emotional involvement in the art spaces. Such technological innovations for creation of immersive spectacular audio-visual environments brought the J. Val del Omar’s cinema into the field of multi-media, and therefore he could rightfully be considered the forerunner of media art, the creator of art spaces, which later became known as sound and video installations.","[{""name"": ""OLGA V.

This article explores the practice-as-research re-enactment of a historic 1960s television show, Jazz 625 (). With the emphasis on the process rather than the product through the production of a modern-day interpretation of the original – entitled Jazz 1080 – the researchers draw conclusions around the complex workings of a television production team through the creation of a new artefact. The empirical research captures how professional attitudes and institutionalized forms of collaborative creative labour shape programme-making. Comparisons are made between the original and re-enacted productions, with the conclusion being made that, despite advances in technology, the practices and processes of television production are remarkably similar between the 1960s and the early twenty-first century.","[{""name"": ""Nicolas Pillai"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121802449 Birmingham City University""]}, {""name"": ""Vanessa Jackson"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121802449 Birmingham City University""]}]","[""10.15180/170808"", ""10.1353/crt.2005.0002"", ""10.18146/2213-0969.2013.jethc040"", ""10.1017/mdh.2013.75"", ""10.1017/S0149767700001029"", ""10.1016/0039-3681(94)00036-9"", ""10.1386/jptv_00046_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

Both Pippin and Žižek agree that Vertigo exemplifies Hegelian reconciliation: Scottie exhibits Hegel’s reconciliatory “negation of negation” when he realizes that his lost love Madeleine had really been Judy all along, thereby losing his original loss. Yet Pippin and Žižek disagree on the precise significance of the concept of reconciliation both for the film and for the contemporary world. Žižek argues for a revolutionary reading of reconciliation in Vertigo: we learn from reconciliation that we must make a revolutionary break from the present world, in order to bring about a wholly new world. Pippin argues for a reformist reading of reconciliation in Vertigo: we learn from reconciliation that we must find the “traces of reason” latent in the present world, in order to gradually reform it for the better. Ultimately, I argue that Žižek’s reading offers the more authentically Hegelian approach to interpreting Hitchcock’s Vertigo. But if nothing else, the Pippin-Žižek debate demonstrates the profound intellectual fecundity of the intersections between film and philosophy for understanding our current historical moment.","[{""name"": ""Dylan Shaul"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Toronto""]}]","[""10.5840/jcp2020421"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10877.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226259796.003.0004"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226503783.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226672144.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv4cbgs9""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The essay discusses not only how the poets wrote but also how they realised the printed forms of their poetry in performance, contrasting Olson’s literal performance of his theories with the different relation of print to performance of his contemporary and associate William Carlos Williams. It argues that Olson’s experiments, polemically formulated in his manifestoProjective Verse, while they have influenced central currents of American poetry since the 1950s, have remained largely American, whereas Celan’s, tentatively intimated in his anti-manifestoDer Meridian, and inimitably personal in their specific forms, can also be seen as modelling ways in which a wide range of twentieth- and twenty-first-century poetry can be realised in reading aloud.","[{""name"": ""David Fuller"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3998/mpub.14048"", ""10.2307/358524"", ""10.4148/2334-4415.1134"", ""10.3998/mpub.13441"", ""10.3998/mpub.15381""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

By suturing the slow aesthetic to the environmental destruction of Inner Mongolia’s landscape and the exploitation of China’s migrant workers, Behemoth reorients the viewing gaze from the spectacular and the exotic towards the self-aware and the introspective. The article argues that Zhao’s film, which featured in the main competition for the Golden Lion at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival, self-consciously manoeuvres between a critique of China’s environmental devastation and the western audience’s expectation of viewing such a catastrophe as a sign of self-expression and self-critique.","[{""name"": ""Zoran Lee Pecic"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000106721325 Roskilde University""]}]","[""10.1215/22011919-3615934"", ""10.1080/03066150.2016.1235036"", ""10.1215/9780822374022-001"", ""10.1386/ac_00026_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

Se ilustra dicha noción a través del análisis cualitativo de nueve largometrajes divididos en tres tipos de narrativas construidas en torno a lugares siniestros o peligrosos: las casas encantadas donde habitan fantasmas, espacios sociales (orfanatos y hospitales) en decadencia, y hogares sometidos a la vigilancia de observadores externos. Los resultados demuestran que, en conjunto, las películas españolas analizadas construyen una imagen del hogar caracterizada por la inseguridad, la desconfianza, y el peligro, reflejando en cierto modo determinados acontecimientos que han marcado la historia reciente del país tales como la progresiva urbanización, la crisis económica, los desahucios o la violencia doméstica.","[{""name"": ""Miguel Ángel Pérez-Gómez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Irene Raya Bravo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Francisco Javier López Rodríguez"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7227/GS.10.2.2"", ""10.1086/669220"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-47325-3_11"", ""10.5565/rev/brumal.633"", ""10.1177/1741659013511833"", ""10.1080/14636204.2013.854610"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66676-1_9"", ""10.7135/UPO9780857284556"", ""10.1515/9780748677658-011"", ""10.1353/mos.2015.0040"", ""10.1386/host.9.2.249_1"", ""10.5040/9781501322440"", ""10.26613/esic.4.2.189"", ""10.17561/grove.v26.a3"", ""10.1080/10509208.2018.1472535"", ""10.1353/hcs.2013.0013"", ""10.1215/9780822392989"", ""10.5209/ARIS.55505"", ""10.24310/Fotocinema.2013.v0i7.5931"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479864379.001.0001""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Philosophy'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Where memory is a defined area of study in the context of Pinter's writing for stage and screen, and to some extent his poetry, it has received little attention in Pinter's activity beyond the arts. The article looks at both Pinter's interrogation of certain kinds of political memory and the forms of remembering Pinter himself modeled in his role as citizen. In the process, it looks to select features of some of Pinter's plays and to what has been said about them in order to suggest where Pinter's interest in memory as an artist flows into his use for memory as a critic of postwar political history. The conclusion reflects on what Pinter's activism in this mode can offer us as citizens today.","[{""name"": ""Basil Chiasson"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Leeds, School of English""]}]","[""10.1017/CCOL0521651239.016"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5rdx7r"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-50816-4"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628061"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511840470"", ""10.1057/9780230617162"", ""10.1017/S0266464X13000687"", ""10.4312/elope.9.1.51-61"", ""10.3998/mpub.348923"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199283262.003.0010"", ""10.4324/9780203391471"", ""10.5325/haropintrevi.2.1.0097"", ""10.5539/ells.v2n2p2"", ""10.5325/haropintrevi.1.1.0029"", ""10.4324/9780203391471_chapter_13"", ""10.3726/978-3-653-05369-2"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-09220-8"", ""10.1353/book13048"", ""10.5040/9781408175293"", ""10.7312/trav17942"", ""10.2979/histmemo.25.1.111"", ""10.1111/j.1475-5661.2012.00502.x""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

The article considers fans’ views of the choices made in the remake and the contextual shifts informing these choices, i.e. their views of the so-called cultural transduction. It argues that the fan discourse around Skam Austin thrives on discussing the transduction in itself, because long-standing fans dominate the discourse and because the show’s depictions of teenage life-worlds are expected to have high realistic ambitions. Comments from fans reveal that much of their enjoyment of Skam Austin resided in expectations about specific ‘remade moments’. Such moments typically express a spirit of social resistance and are, if successful, celebrated as iconic. In the politicized American media climate of the day, ‘remade moments’ that particularly engaged fans focused on representation issues concerning gender and race, such as intersectional identities and awareness about sexual harassment.","[{""name"": ""Anne Bachmann"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121743522 Linneaus University""]}]","[""10.1007/s10676-018-9495-z"", ""10.1080/14680777.2017.1261822"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apz033"", ""10.1177/1367877920938798"", ""10.1386/jfs.4.3.251_1"", ""10.1515/9781474470933-020"", ""10.11606/issn.1982-8160.v9i1p147-163"", ""10.7146/ntik.v6i2.99080"", ""10.1177/1527476417741379"", ""10.1086/498988"", ""10.1386/jfs.7.2.113_1"", ""10.1080/14680777.2018.1546210"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-97322-7_8"", ""10.1177/1749602018796755"", ""10.1177/1749602019879856"", ""10.7560/309001-007"", ""10.1057/sub.2013.13"", ""10.1386/jsca_00043_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

West Indian immigrants’ struggles against state resistance to everyday black life. In a rather profound contrast to McQueen’s other work—in which long takes of suffering bodies draw the viewer into the inescapability of the pain experienced by his subjects—joy disrupted provides the counterpoint to bodies in pain. Striking this balance between suffering and joyous bodies is one of the reasons that McQueen’s series may be his best effort yet to move between art cinema and popular genres. The various films in Small Axe fit in disparate genres, but all but one clearly fit into the category of racial injustice films. But McQueen’s play with genre is what allows him to creative straddle the line between hope and Afropessimism.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Wanzo"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Selon lui, les images de pilosité humaine que l’on trouve dans ces œuvres servent à trois fins : communiquer concrètement l’identité humaine ; signaler la matérialité excessive, non assimilée du corps ; et corporaliser le passage du temps sous la forme d’une matière inerte qui complique la distinction entre corps organiques et inorganiques. L’auteur utilise l’œuvre du théoricien allemand du cinéma Siegfried Kracauer, qui s’est lui-même intéressé à la peau et au cuir chevelu, pour asseoir sur des bases théoriques la pilosité filmique de Denis. Jusqu’à maintenant, peu de chercheurs ont tenté d’établir un lien entre les films de Denis et les écrits de Kracauer — et moins encore ont entrepris de théoriser la pilosité filmique —, un exercice qui jette néanmoins un nouvel éclairage sur la façon dont nous abordons la pilosité à l’écran. Sur un plan plus large, l’auteur contribue dont à un effort intellectuel plus général pour élaborer une « théorie de la pilosité » susceptible d’expliquer la présence et l’importance de la pilosité dans le discours culturel et cinématographique.","[{""name"": ""Raymond DeLuca"", ""affiliation"": [""Raymond DeLuca – Slavic Literatures and Languages, Harvard University, Cambridge,  Massachusetts, United States""]}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article examines Eliot’s efforts to articulate such a principle in her novel Romola (1862–63) and Shaw’s echoes and critiques of her ideas in Major Barbara (1905). While Eliot’s ending calls for a humanistic faith rooted in compassion and fellowship, Shaw dismissed individual compassion as an ineffective substitute for socialist reform. Moreover, whereas Eliot’s novel ultimately rejects the idea of religious institutions, Shaw left the issue unsettled in Major Barbara and returned to it in later writings in an effort to formulate an idea of a widely shared religion grounded in economic equity and cooperation with the Life Force.","[{""name"": ""Mary Christian"", ""affiliation"": [""Middle Georgia State University""]}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

Following an outline of pertinent events from 2014 to 2022, including the Song Contest and the respective countries’ selected entries as well as the public discourse surrounding them, two distinct types of cultural diplomacy—culturalist versus neo-propagandist—are employed in a congruence analysis. The findings show that Russia employed a largely neo-propagandist approach to cultural diplomacy characterized by their projected image of peacefulness, innocence, and strength to alter their situational image. Ukraine has employed a mostly culturalist approach mainly focused on mutual recognition and the representation of national culture. The conscious instrumentalization of the platform to counter misconstrued perceptions of Ukraine shaped by the Kremlin’s rhetoric also adds neo-propagandist elements.","[{""name"": ""Lea M Welslau"", ""affiliation"": [""Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Torsten J Selck"", ""affiliation"": [""Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Germany""]}]","[""10.2298/MUZ0707039B"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-9427-0_8"", ""10.5642/urceu.201701.06"", ""10.1111/russ.10717"", ""10.1017/S0960777316000126"", ""10.1057/9781137367983"", ""10.1142/S0219525913500379"", ""10.4324/9780429465543-6"", ""10.1080/09592296.2016.1169791"", ""10.5612/slavicreview.71.4.0873"", ""10.1080/00905992.2012.742990"", ""10.1111/russ.10718"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_474310"", ""10.4324/9780429465543-16"", ""10.1057/9781137367983_6"", ""10.1057/9780230554931"", ""10.1177/0002716207311699"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-9427-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63163-9_10"", ""10.1016/0378-8733(95)00253-K"", ""10.3384/cu.2000.1525.1608165"", ""10.21428/66f840a4.b16a85d1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

GEMMA's main objective is to explore the multi-layered relationships between gender and media in the peculiar conditions of the contemporary 'media saturated' environment, employing an approach that maps the media's potential for changing cultural representations of gender. Without renouncing the representational approach, the recent iterations of GEMMA research have shifted focus towards addressing new objects and paths of investigation. Ranging across a variety of media and genres, from television and advertising, to public communication campaigns, from web-based social networks to dating platforms, from documentary to fiction, from wellness reality to cooking shows, the latest works that have been conducted during the 2016–19 years investigate forms of agency displayed by individuals, groups or institutions directly involved and engaged in the production and consumption of media texts relevant to gender. In this article, the authors summarize their research as contributing to the composition of a polyphonic text on gender and media in Italy.","[{""name"": ""Milly Buonanno"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121747048 Sapienza University of Rome""]}, {""name"": ""Franca Faccioli"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121747048 Sapienza University of Rome""]}, {""name"": ""Paola Panarese"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121747048 Sapienza University of Rome""]}, {""name"": ""Francesca Comunello"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121747048 Sapienza University of Rome""]}, {""name"": ""Giovanni Ciofalo"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121747048 Sapienza University of Rome""]}, {""name"": ""Silvia Leonzi"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121747048 Sapienza University of Rome""]}, {""name"": ""Mihaela Gavrila"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121747048 Sapienza University of Rome""]}, {""name"": ""Anna Lucia Natale"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121747048 Sapienza University of Rome""]}, {""name"": ""Francesca Ieracitano"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000119560575 Lumsa University of Rome""]}]","[""10.1177/0196859912473777"", ""10.1177/144078339202800204"", ""10.1080/00913367.2004.10639158"", ""10.1177/1461444811410395"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00020.x"", ""10.1080/08838158909364071"", ""10.1177/1461444816681540"", ""10.1177/0196859905275972"", ""10.1177/1527476409332394"", ""10.7227/CST.8.2.3"", ""10.1080/01972243.2017.1414093"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2958.1994.tb00332.x"", ""10.1177/0267323102017001605"", ""10.1386/jicms_00021_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

All three films are female-centered coming-of-age stories, prompting Benson-Allott to read them as a trilogy. Doing so not only honors Gerwig’s achievement as an auteur, Benson-Allott suggests, but also generates important questions about what these films say about girlhood and middle-class white American women’s quest for autonomy and self-determination. Gerwig’s trilogy reveals an artist struggling to make sense of girl culture and the societal paradigms that impact it.","[{""name"": ""Caetlin Benson-Allott"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Medieval medical theories, rooted in classical thought, emphasise the bodily spirits and in particular, the ways that motions of the ‘vital spirit’—closely connected with breath—cause powerful physical responses that write emotions on the body in sighs, swoons, and even death. Physiological theory was complemented by theological notions of pneuma, the Spirit of divinity and life. The movement of breath plays a key role in depictions of emotion from love to grief, and in visionary or mystical experience. This essay explores breath and breathlessness in a range of English secular and devotional literary texts: popular romance writing, the medically alert fictions of Chaucer, and visionary works including the Revelations of Divine Love of Julian of Norwich and the spiritual autobiography of Margery Kempe. In all these works, concepts of the vital spirits and the role of breath in emotion are central. The play of breath underpins and shapes depictions of romantic love, explorations of the boundary between life and death, and ideas of spiritual revelation, creating narratives of profoundly embodied, affective experience.","[{""name"": ""Corinne Saunders"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CCOL9780521853439"", ""10.1515/9781400822676"", ""10.1093/0199266387.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511518737"", ""10.9783/9780812296082"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226761312.001.0001""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['History', 'Classics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6825), ('0602 中国史', 0.6817)]]"

There has been a convergence as well as a divergence of independent cinema and art cinema facilitated by institutional reforms of the Chinese film industry. This article examines how small- to medium-sized film production companies work as market actors as well as intermediaries between independent filmmakers, the state and the market to co-opt independent cinema into an officially approved art cinema and activate the market potential of art cinema through engaging with the cultural economy. This officially approved art cinema is not construed as an alternative to, and a form of resistance to, the mainstream but as a booster for the industry. This article offers new insights into the interrelation of artistic, commercial and political interests and demonstrates how these interests shape meanings and modes of ‘independence’ and ‘art’ in contemporary global film industries.","[{""name"": ""Lydia Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000104627212 Newcastle University""]}]","[""10.5406/jaesteduc.45.2.0001"", ""10.1093/screen/hjz015"", ""10.1093/screen/22.1.11"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2008.00786.x"", ""10.1386/jcc.2.1.37_1"", ""10.1386/ac_00044_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

This non-anthropocentric hypothesis was first formulated in 1946 by filmmaker and theorist Jean Epstein and regards film as the thinking performance of a technical apparatus, the cinematograph, which is a manifestation of machine thinking based on the holistic entanglement of thought and world, film and philosophy. The article pursues an enquiry into ‘thinking’: one of the most prominent and oldest topics considered in philosophy, and also essential to art and film. Thinking is not only characterised as a sense (like sight or taste) but as a creative and, ultimately, intra-active act. The possibility of film as AI is approached not only from a Deleuzian angle, long appraised by film-philosophy, but also through questions recently raised by theories of artistic research and the speculative-materialist turn in contemporary philosophy. The latter have as a common denominator a strong critique of anthropocentrism in Western philosophy; the article enquires into this criticism from different angles and applies it to the main hypothesis of this analysis – to regard film as a form of AI.","[{""name"": ""Christine Reeh Peters"", ""affiliation"": [""Film University Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF""]}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv12101zq"", ""10.5840/harvardreview1999713"", ""10.5040/9781350251991"", ""10.1515/9780748692903"", ""10.5040/9781350928558"", ""10.1215/9780822396871"", ""10.4159/9780674042834"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511606366"", ""10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Science Applications', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

This disease, which has morphed into a global pandemic, has mobilized outrageous outpouring action worldwide. Despite international and local media attention coupled with overwhelming new facts replete with misinformation and disinformation on COVID-19 from many channels; including interpersonal and social media, efforts to scale up control measures have yielded mixed results. The government and Kenyan media have reported several cases in which the public and leaders flouted these measures thus putting themselves at risk of contracting or spreading the virus. The overarching question is: does fear-arousing communication really matter in behaviour change particularly during a global pandemic of the magnitude of COVID-19? This qualitative study therefore examined the effects of COVID-19 messages on health behaviour change among residents living in the Municipality of Busia, one of the towns that have recorded the highest incidences of confirmed COVID-19 cases as informed by the Extended Parallel Process and Health Belief behavioural change models. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were carried out to establish threat and coping appraisal as a result of COVID-19 messages received from different sources. The study employed a risk behaviour diagnosis assessment that focused on two components of health risk messages, that is, threat and recommended response that addresses efficacy issues. This study found out that despite universal knowledge of COVID-19 and prevention methods, perceived threat especially perceived vulnerability to the virus was low due to misinformation, disinformation and disjointed communication.","[{""name"": ""Omukule Emojong’"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107448172 Maseno University""]}]","[""10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090824"", ""10.1023/B:AIBE.0000030244.92791.63"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.1981.tb00832.x"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2005.10.026"", ""10.1037/0278-6133.26.2.136"", ""10.1177/009365000027004003"", ""10.1080/15213260701853112"", ""10.1097/00002030-199612000-00016"", ""10.1080/08838159509364309"", ""10.1177/1090198111418108"", ""10.1080/00223980.1975.9915803"", ""10.1126/science.3563507"", ""10.4135/9781452233260.n5"", ""10.1080/03637759209376276"", ""10.1177/109019810002700506"", ""10.1386/jams_00043_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Applied Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7573), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7417)]]"

I argue that in the case of women's sports, as well as other less prominently mediated sports, the industry logics that structure hierarchies of visibility deflect responsibility for representation away from networks, brands, and leagues and onto fans, who are left to promote women's sports through their engagement online. This strategy shields the business of sports from the risk of investing in women athletes and instead places promotional responsibility on fan labor.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer McClearen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Most actors undertake intensive training to achieve the complex skillset required to execute this art form, yet professional success can be elusive. It appears that a key element to building and maintaining a musical theatre career is performance synergy. This phenomenon is described colloquially as stage presence or X-factor. Whilst the literature regarding the field of musical theatre training is wide-ranging, little formal research has been undertaken on the ephemeral subject of performance synergy as it pertains to the work of the musical theatre actor. To address this lacuna in the literature – and to determine whether performance synergy can be described, comprehended, taught or learned – semi-structured interviews were conducted with 42 Australian actors and creative directors active in the musical theatre industry. Collected data captured expert opinions on the elements, constructs and praxis of musical theatre performance synergy. Following a thematic analysis of the data, a framework of seven performative processes was constructed towards a clearer understanding of the practical aspects of this multifaceted phenomenon.","[{""name"": ""Jacqui Cuny"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404375432 Griffith University""]}]","[""10.1080/19443927.2013.794157"", ""10.1080/17439760.2016.1262613"", ""10.1386/smt.8.1.57_1"", ""10.1080/20567790.2016.1155366"", ""10.1080/23268263.2017.1370833"", ""10.1080/23268263.2011.10739516"", ""10.1080/23268263.2005.10739482"", ""10.1080/10486800802547286"", ""10.1386/smt_00094_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Urban Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

The essay shows how Lillian Gilbreth positioned film as an interactive medium, directing experimental exhibition practices that instantiated mimesis among spectators; treated features of bodily difference as individually addressable and serviceable to productivity; and exploited the human body's predisposition for habituation, and therefore predictability.","[{""name"": ""Julia A.

10.3167/proj.2022.160201,PROJECTIONS-THE JOURNAL FOR MOVIES AND MIND,1303 Drama Film and Television,Evolution of the Depiction of Telephone Calls in Popular Movies,"Since Aristotle, tradition has it that stories are defined as unified wholes, divisible into smaller inter-related parts. In many narrative forms these parts are called scenes. Scenes, too, are regarded as wholes, typically unified on three grounds: a constancy of characters and location within a continuous time frame. Generally, if a storyteller changes one or more of these, the story has moved on to the next scene. But this rule is not universal. The most obvious exception in movies is the telephone call, which can change locations to accommodate images of the two conversing characters. Here, I explore a century’s worth of popular, English-language movies to discern how two-sided telephone conversations (which violate spatial unity) are portrayed on the screen, and how they compare to face-to-face conversations (which do not violate spatial unity) in the same movies. The portrayal of both types of conversations has evolved, sometimes independently and sometimes in synchrony, and popular filmmaking has arrived circuitously at a system in which both are generally portrayed in the same way—two characters in alternating shots, slightly to opposite sides of the midline and turned towards one another. I discuss the social and psychological reasons why this might be the case.","[{""name"": ""James E.

University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 1996) and the social and cultural capacity to aspire (Culture and public action. Stanford University Press, Stanford, 2004). The chapter reflects on the processes that took place when co-constructing visions, including the ways co-constructing visions may have been the fuel for action, and analyzes the implications of the resulting co-constructed visions. The findings highlight the importance of developing and supporting collaborative learning for the development of both preservice and inservice music teacher education.","[{""name"": ""Danielle Shannon Treacy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/08992363-12-1-1"", ""10.1080/14767720600750696"", ""10.1177/1057083710377722"", ""10.4135/9788132100683.n1"", ""10.1177/0255761415584300"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.36.11.1344"", ""10.1080/00313831.2012.656285"", ""10.1017/s0265051714000102"", ""10.5617/adno.2646"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226467016.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812705"", ""10.17730/humo.67.4.xp341p168m141641"", ""10.1080/00131946.2014.924942"", ""10.1080/10632913.2011.546702"", ""10.5406/bulcouresmusedu.189.0007"", ""10.1177/1321103X19845145"", ""10.1002/9781118256060""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Education', 'Music', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Although current government strategies in education emphasize aesthetic subjects such as drama/theatre (Xiju), and include methods and conventions in educational drama, it is hard to perceive whether the policy is open to an explorative learning process, characteristic of educational drama, or rather implies a more classical approach, based on textbooks and memorization, or even pure learning techniques.

The territory of the Hul’q’umi’num’ people extends along the Salish Sea from Nanoose to Malahaton Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. Today, around forty fluent first-language speakers remain, mostly over the age of 60, and thus Hul’q’umi’num’ is considered an endangered language. However, among the population of over 6,000 Hul’q’umi’num’, there are many people who desire to learn the language or improve their fluency. By embarking on the next step—turning traditional stories into theatre—the wproject is hoping to bring the language to the eyes and ears of the community, and, for the participants, it will possibly help unlock their ability to speak Hul’q’umi’num’. This article argues that applied theatre can be used to effectively address concerns pertaining to—in this case—the indigenous community the language revitalization work is meant to benefit, even though there are multiple challenges that stand in the way of such a process. The work has a strong focus on traditional and playful artistry and on consensus.","[{""name"": ""Kirsten Sadeghi-Yekta"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/1356978022000007983"", ""10.5040/9781472522993"", ""10.1386/atr.3.1.21_1"", ""10.4135/9781483385686"", ""10.1075/z.158.18ger"", ""10.1080/15348450903305031"", ""10.1057/9780230242425""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Health', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Linguistics and Language']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)]]"

10.1017/S0266464X23000258,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,Documenting Crisis: Artistic Innovation and Institutional Transformations in the German-Speaking Countries and the UK,"The unprecedented suspension of cultural events across Europe in March 2020 had a profound impact on the performing arts. Alongside the proliferation of digital and hybrid modes of theatre-making, the Covid-19 pandemic has also precipitated a substantive shift in how theatres operate at both institutional and organizational levels in an attempt to respond to the volatile economic impact of the pandemic on the culture sector. This has provided a decisive moment for the reinterpretation of the theatre landscape, raising fundamental questions relating to institutional transformation that challenge precarious working models and entrenched hierarchical divides. Drawing on wider transnational research as part of the ‘Theatre after Covid’ project, this article examines the institutional effects of the pandemic on theatre and performance in the United Kingdom and the German-speaking countries.

Inspired by the work of British documentarian Paul Rotha, whose United Nation picture World Without End (Mexico/Thailand/United Kingdom, 1953, codirected with Basil Wright) was partly filmed at CREFAL, these films frequently resorted to a docudrama format that enabled amateur documentary filmmakers to engage with the agendas of their indigenous subjects even as they subordinated them to the United Nation’s call to hygiene, progress and civic values. In doing so, they responded creatively to appeals by theorists such as Kracauer and Grierson for a critical realist cinema. They also acted as a link between the so-called ‘classical’ pre-war documentary movements in the United Kingdom, North America and elsewhere, and the later, socially committed new cinemas.","[{""name"": ""David M.

While an untrained model of IBM Natural Language Understanding reveals Ding's using the translation to criticize imperialism, a trained machine learning model using IBM Watson Knowledge Studio shows the qualities of the Shavian Great Man. The IBM artificial intelligence and machine learning platforms, drawing attention to words and the semantic relations between them, uncover a subtle relationship between Ding Xilin's Chinese translation and the personality cult around China's Great Man, Mao Zedong (1893–1976), around the time of Ding's translation. The artificial intelligence platforms show that there may be subtle connections between Shaw's play and the most dominant figure in China at the time of the translation.","[{""name"": ""Kay Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

These scales were developed nearly a century ago, and were the product of hard negotiation and legal action taken by US-American designers in the interwar period. Lee Simonson and Jo Mielziner are best remembered for their revolutionary use of space, scenery, and lighting, yet their professional advocacy within USA Local 829 provided the basis for today's standard design fees.

I situate the film in relation to persistent ethical questions regarding documentary encounters with death, arguing that Rosi’s self-reflexive alignment with – and interrogation of – several touristic gazes opens a set of primarily political concerns. These are elucidated in dialogue with the thought of philosopher Roberto Esposito on biopolitics and the ‘immunitarian’ paradigm. Through this lens, the documentary’s self-conscious adoption of touristic perspectives may be understood as revealing and challenging an exoticizing fantasy, animated by contagion and immunity, that frames Benares as a space exempt from the modern biopolitical impulse to protect the boundaries of individuals from the shared fabric of the commons.","[{""name"": ""Lucy Bollington"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121901201 University College London""]}]","[""10.1080/13576270701430692"", ""10.1525/fq.2018.71.3.10"", ""10.1386/jicms_00136_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Philosophy', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

In response to the decay of the Soviet mentality, it is necessary to understand how to overcome the split in society and make the process of cultural transformation under modernization conditions less painful for people. One of the mechanisms of forming the cultural identity of peoples is an appeal to the positive experience in common history. Simply copying the previous forms and means of forming cultural identity is impossible, since socio-economic foundations change; therefore, the problem needs a different solution. Exploring the Soviet past, one can understand which ideological values contributed to the consolidation of society in order to use this experience in construction of Russian civilizational identity. The purpose of the article is to study the films by Elyor Ishmukhamedov Tenderness (1966) and Lovers (1969) as “texts” that construct Soviet identity by dint of the recognition and acceptance of the ideal life model by the society. Since humans transform themselves and the world around them through an imitation, the main research questions are as follows: what social interaction features can be identified in these films? What is the appeal of the Soviet discourse and how is it transmitted in such seemingly “non-ideological” films? Ishmukhamedov’s films were studied as a semiotic system, in which the main myths and archetypes were revealed that had a manipulative and mobilizing influence on the viewer, thereby creating an image of a Soviet person which is attractive to the masses. The everyday life captured in these films symbolizes the stability and reliability of living in the USSR and Central Asia in the 1960s. After analyzing the figurative system of the Soviet-time everyday life in Ishmukhamedov’s films, the author finds out that identity is a system consisting of ethnic, cultural, age, natural, social, professional, mental, artifact identities, as well as the identity of the genus and small groups, which set the models and patterns of behavior for a Soviet person, which patterns were accepted and copied by the people.","[{""name"": ""SVETLANA Ya.

In particular, the film struggles with the meaning of “the woods” in the horror genre. Cabin’s central twist in this respect is that the titular “woods” are not untamed nature, but rather a place of artifice. Cabin’s woods are not uncanny because they are far removed from “civilization,” but rather exactly because they are part of it.

A deluge of propaganda deployed by hostile states is aimed at polarizing societies, undermining the decision-making capabilities of governments, and influencing public policy. Against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the stakes are enormous. Heeding research on debunking and pre-bunking strategies recognizing the limitations and potential of these approaches in inoculating populations against disinformation, this paper examines how several tactics deployed in the CEE region can both speak to and draw from this literature. While certain segments of CEE populations may be vulnerable to disinformation, the region also boasts civically engaged publics that want to take an active part in fostering societal resilience. The rise of digital elves (volunteer information warriors taking the fight to online trolls), the outsourcing of counter-disinformation activities to popular public institutions (like the police and military), and the use of crowdfunding to support news literacy education and independent media outlets present compelling alternative strategies towards responding to foreign influence. These activities show promise in overcoming obstacles faced by conventional approaches to disinformation and addressing CEE-specific issues related to media distrust and state capture of the media.","[{""name"": ""Shane Markowitz"", ""affiliation"": [""Comenius University, Slovakia""]}]","[""10.1080/21599165.2019.1662398"", ""10.18352/ulr.420"", ""10.1080/09546553.2019.1693370"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0175799"", ""10.1080/13600826.2020.1839387"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90506-8"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.11.037"", ""10.1080/01972243.2017.1391913"", ""10.1111/jasp.12453"", ""10.1146/annurev-publhealth-090419-102409"", ""10.1080/10463283.2021.1876983"", ""10.1177/1529100612451018"", ""10.1080/21507740.2020.1740351"", ""10.1080/0963928021000031466"", ""10.3233/978-1-61499-943-0-75"", ""10.1080/10511253.2011.590512"", ""10.1007/s10796-021-10240-7"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2022.2061817"", ""10.1111/pops.12586"", ""10.1093/heapro/daab140"", ""10.3109/01421599609034145"", ""10.1002/gch2.201600008"", ""10.1177/0163443720906992"", ""10.1177/1461444820908530"", ""10.5688/ajpe75228""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.7146/nts.v32i2.124358,NORDIC THEATRE STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Constructing Finno-Ugric Identity through Theatre,"The article investigates the construction of transnational Finno-Ugric identity through the theatre festival Mayatul and different performative strategies. This kind of identity construction is investigated through the framework of identity politics and transnationalism. The definition of the Finno-Ugric peoples (Finns, Estonians, Hungarians, Samis, Mordvins, Komi, Udmurts and others) is based foremost on their language kinship. It is believed that similar characteristics of languages and a similar natural environment and climate have shaped the close-to-nature lifestyle and the particular perception of the world shared by the Finno-Ugric peoples.Essential platforms for constructing transnational Finno-Ugric identity are different theatre festivals, among which Mayatul (since 1992) is the most prominent. The majority of productions at the festival are performed in Finno-Ugric languages and interpret the literary texts or folklore of these peoples. However, only a few productions strive for indigenous aesthetics like those of Estonian theatre director Anne Türnpu. The Finno-Ugric peoples’ identity is predominantly a minority identity because mostly they represent a small national and language group in a bigger state like Russia, and only Finland and Hungary have enjoyed one hundred years of independence. Nevertheless, all countries and nations embrace smaller ethnic or cultural minorities, thus minority identity is a universal concept. Theatre festivals are able to unite minority identities into larger transnational identites, even when it is just an imagined community.","[{""name"": ""Luule Epner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anneli Saro"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Food Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Of those processes, ‘empathy and distancing’, ‘play’, ‘life-drama connection’ and ‘transformation’ were especially prominent. Implications include the potential for knowledge sharing and future collaboration between the TCA and drama therapy fields.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Elowe"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000092155771 Lesley University""]}, {""name"": ""Siggi Schorr"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000008795072X OCD Institute, McLean Hospital""]}, {""name"": ""Emily Faith"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000403835679 Cook Children’s Hospital""]}, {""name"": ""Brett Alters"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000092155771 Lesley University""]}, {""name"": ""Laura L.

10.3138/ctr.183.006,CANADIAN THEATRE REVIEW,1303 Drama Film and Television,Clowning but Not: A Clown's Approach to Drama for People with Intellectual and Physical Disabilities,"Even without the red nose and costume, clowning has much to offer when used as an approach to teaching creative drama to people with intellectual and physical disabilities. Clown humour and animated play encourage creativity, movement, and self-expression. With a clown-like approach, markers for success change and become more relevant to the level at which participants are working. Using a clown approach allows participants to expand their capacities by releasing the fear of not accomplishing their goals. In fact, slipping up and failing at tasks are good reasons for the group to laugh and relax. In my experience in setting up drama programs at the Manitoba Developmental Centre, I discovered the value of the clown’s flop. By embracing failure, participants were more able to enjoy taking risks. Non-verbal communication skills and object transformation, common to clown play, also created new possibilities for the participants’ creativity and expression. As a result, they were able to move, play, and communicate in unexpected ways and put on a performance for 300 people. The community of therapeutic clowns—including Karen Ridd, Joan Barrington, and organizations like the Dr. Clown Foundation—engages a similar approach to working with the public. They embrace failure and succeed at bringing joy through humour, clown antics, and play.","[{""name"": ""Sue Proctor"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13528165.2012.651867""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Conservation', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Plus précisément, bien que le penchant de la RV pour les expériences à la première personne mérite d’être critiqué, ce projet démontre comment différents modes d’adresse peuvent être utilisés pour concevoir des formes documentaires qui placent le public dans une position de témoin qui serait respectueuse des sujets représentés et de leurs expériences.","[{""name"": ""Philippe Bédard"", ""affiliation"": [""McGill University, English, Montréal, Québec, Canada""]}]","[""10.3138/cjfs.28.1.2019-0012"", ""10.1386/josc.9.1.73_1"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1992.tb00812.x"", ""10.1201/9781315155319"", ""10.1177/1329878X17726794"", ""10.1177/1470412920906259"", ""10.1177/1470412920906260"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-71027-3_19""]","['Computer Science', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Computer Networks and Communications', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

As its name suggests, horrifying whiteness evokes the complex relationship between white supremacy and the horror genre calling attention to the violent white supremacist performances that are enacted on and off the big screen. In this article, I introduce my concept of horrifying whiteness which draws from previous Black scholarship on the gaze such as Frantz Fanon's Black Skin, White Masks (1952) and bell hooks's Black Looks: Race and Representation (1992) but distinguishes itself by rendering white supremacy and the gaze as horrific via the horror genre. As a case in point, Jordan Peele's Get Out (2017) epitomizes horrifying whiteness through its depiction of the Armitages and their clients who mask themselves as good innocent white people while they privately abduct and sell/purchase Black bodies and exploit them. By reading Peele's Get Out through the lens of horrifying whiteness, I consider how horror frameworks not only challenge white denial and white innocence, but provide a lens through which Black vulnerability can perhaps be most clearly seen.","[{""name"": ""Julia Mollenthiel"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Charismatic actress-managers such as Madame Vestris and Mrs Keeley have long been familiar to students of British theatre, as too the establishments they managed. Much less well known is the City of London Theatre in Norton Folgate, one of several minor playhouses then active in the East End. Opened in the year that Victoria came to the throne (1837), during its first decade the City was unrivalled as a home for the so-called ‘wo-manager’. Although largely forgotten today, Lucy Honey, Eliza Vincent, Harriett Lacy, and Maria Honner added much to the cultural vibrancy of an important theatre district at a moment of significant social change. Stephen Ridgwell here explores an under-researched world of theatre enterprise, and argues that the marginality subsequently conferred upon these women in no way reflects their contemporary visibility and standing. The article also highlights the importance of Eliza Vincent’s collaborations with George Dibdin Pitt, a dramatist of growing interest to scholars across a range of fields, and proposes that further consideration of this partnership might usefully be undertaken.","[{""name"": ""Stephen Ridgwell"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It argues that in setting up tangible, specific ways to look at the medium of cinema, the artistic practice of artists such as Islam effectively offers a theorization of cinema itself for the age of its obsolescence. Art practices, such as Islam’s, that are simultaneously a kind of curation of cinema constitute not only a way of reflecting on the medium’s historicity, but also of experimenting with its possible reemergence as something other than its historical self.","[{""name"": ""Matilde Nardelli"", ""affiliation"": [""the University of West London""]}]","[""10.1093/screen/hjp028"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_442726"", ""10.2307/j.ctv12101zq"", ""10.1525/fq.1974.28.2.04a00080"", ""10.5117/NECSUS2012.2.CASE"", ""10.5040/9781838710125"", ""10.7312/elwe17450"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7851.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1470412909105694"", ""10.4159/9780674042834"", ""10.5117/NECSUS2012.2.SMIT"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226109022.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Against the notion that boredom is a form of ambient gloom that contributes to his “theatre of mood” (in Vsevolod Meyerhold’s enduring phase), I suggest that boredom is, for Chekhov, a disease with a narrowly patterned pathology, which he mobilizes as a dramatic technique. Chekhov’s formulation of “pathology plays” allowed him to make implicit recommendations to the intelligentsia about how to remedy their stultification, even as he avoided outright moral or political prescriptivism. His audiences are made to feel alongside his characters, not only through straightforward identification with their diagnoses, but also through a minimalist aesthetics that causes boredom to redouble itself in seeping from the stage into the auditorium. By focusing on the widespread understanding, in turn-of-the-century Russia, of boredom as a disease, I show how Chekhov was able to maintain the objectivity of a physician while putting the pain of boredom into a narrative, dialogic form.","[{""name"": ""Elizabeth M.

10.3138/ctr.193.004,CANADIAN THEATRE REVIEW,1303 Drama Film and Television,Casting Blackface in Canada: Unmasking the History of 'White and Black' Minstrel Shows,"Blackface minstrelsy was the dominant form of mass entertainment for over a century, from the 1840s through the 1940s. In Canada, there has been little scholarly research into the topic but for the work of Stephen Johnson and, in recent years, the works I have published on the subject. One of the reasons blackface has been understudied is the dearth of attention paid to histories of slavery. By exploring the history of casting blackface productions, both ‘white’ minstrelsy (white performers blackening up to imitate the song and dance of African-Americans) and ‘Black’ minstrelsy (Black performers in and out of blackface performing caricatures of themselves in front of majority-white audiences), we gain an understanding of how these shows were produced, and what audiences found appealing about them. Canada has produced its own blackface stars, like Colin ‘Cool’ Burgess (1840–1905) and Calixa Lavallée (1842–1891), both of whom toured the United States and Canada in the late nineteenth century and who not only performed in blackface but also produced songs, some of which are still known today, like “O Canada,” the Canadian national anthem, composed by Lavallée in 1880. Additionally, what the history of casting blackface in Canada shows is a long-standing desire among white audiences for depictions of the American Plantation South that often included the participation of local actors like playwright and writer Charles Wesley Handscomb (1867–1906), who moved to Winnipeg in 1879, who were often cast in touring minstrel productions to sing in blackface.","[{""name"": ""Cheryl Thompson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3406/globe.1887.4640"", ""10.3998/mpub.5306356"", ""10.3138/9781487586249-009"", ""10.3138/9781487586249"", ""10.3138/9781487529185-019""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

Harris, for Black artists and audiences. I argue that Black Out Nights, along with Theatre Passe Muraille’s other approaches to audiences, help to reveal and to challenge larger practices of ‘casting’ audiences that are employed by mainstream theatres. These casting practices, which operate through theatres’ websites, marketing, and theatre spaces, may be unconsciously exercised but help to reinforce white supremacy and other forms of discrimination and exclusion in theatre spaces through the audiences they make feel welcome and exclude.","[{""name"": ""Signy Lynch"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.51644/9781771121705-003"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99166-5""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

By several illustrative cases, we describe the mechanisms of hollowing out, capturing environmental institutions, instrumentalising green aims and repressing civil initiatives as systemic characteristics for illiberal hybrid regimes.","[{""name"": ""Andrea Éltető"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of World Economics, HUN-REN Centre for Economic and Regional Studies, Hungary""]}, {""name"": ""Judit Ricz"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of World Economics, HUN-REN Centre for Economic and Regional Studies, Hungary"", ""Institute of Global Studies, Corvinus University of Budapest, Hungary""]}]","[""10.1007/s10842-019-00322-3"", ""10.1177/0308518X231156910"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00640"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198837367.013.33"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3608784"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090092"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.01.007"", ""10.1080/13510340902777800"", ""10.1080/01402382.2018.1511958"", ""10.1080/13510347.2018.1455664"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4292.001.0001"", ""10.1177/10245294221076225"", ""10.1080/09644016.2022.2113607"", ""10.1111/dech.12570"", ""10.7829/j.ctv2cw0s7k"", ""10.1080/13510347.2019.1590814"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050113"", ""10.1007/s12116-011-9088-x"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12225"", ""10.1080/10758216.2021.2023579"", ""10.1080/03932729.2021.1956718"", ""10.1080/13501763.2021.1918214"", ""10.1108/S0742-332220180000038007"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2020.101920"", ""10.2478/ausae-2019-0004"", ""10.1556/032.2016.66.4.1"", ""10.20332/tvk-jnatconserv.2017.23.201"", ""10.11647/OBP.0244.01"", ""10.1080/09644016.2021.1898879"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781353"", ""10.1017/S0003055421001301"", ""10.1080/13510347.2019.1627520"", ""10.4324/9780367260569"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674419582"", ""10.1057/9781137359506"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105084"", ""10.1177/1070496517747660"", ""10.1080/09644016.2018.1444723"", ""10.1093/oxrep/gru025"", ""10.1017/9781108952996"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-48752-2"", ""10.1177/1024529414563009"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-5233-0_7"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1821662"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-55165-0"", ""10.1080/13563467.2019.1598960"", ""10.1007/BF02800470"", ""10.1016/j.esr.2022.100817"", ""10.1080/21599165.2022.2055551""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This brutalist icon, designed in the 1950s by Marcel Breuer, was recently abandoned by its original inhabitants. The ongoing transition of the building from highly secured embassy to public cultural centre makes for a moment to reflect on the meanings this space inspires. In this special section, we posit the building as a prism through which we probe the connections between art, architecture and international law. In line with the tradition of (re)invention embodied by Breuer’s design, the section breathes experimentation. The contributions are eclectic, unconventional and rough round the edges. The section is structured as a route through the building with no particular order or hierarchy. The ‘façade’ functions as a somewhat natural starting point, thereafter, the reader is invited to choose her own route. All spaces that can be visited are actual spaces in the building and echo the source of inspiration of the contributor. We invite you to join us on our journey and to explore the special issue as you would explore and make sense of an abandoned building where traces of international law abound.","[{""name"": ""Sofia Stolk"", ""affiliation"": [""TMC Asser Instituut/University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Renske Vos"", ""affiliation"": [""VU Amsterdam, the Netherlands""]}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Philosophy', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

It describes the logics, achievements and challenges of Teatro de la Inclusión and Fuera de la Campana, two theatrical experiences coordinated by the authors in southern Spain. These cases have been investigated and documented through ethnographic procedures that have included participant observation and in-depth interviews with the group’s participants, among other data-collection techniques. Through the voices of their protagonists, the authors critically discuss the perceived benefits of the experiences by studying their potential for recognition and the artistic teaching methodologies put into play. They also analyse the convergences and divergences in the aesthetic-political conceptions of each of the groups and their consequences in their respective contexts.","[{""name"": ""Belén Massó-Guijarro"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121678994 University of Granada, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Manuel Muñoz-Bellerín"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122002355 Pablo Olavide University, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Purificación Pérez-García"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121678994 University of Granada, Spain""]}]","[""10.1080/102866302900324658"", ""10.1386/atr.5.3.225_1"", ""10.1177/0004867415582053"", ""10.1525/can.1993.8.2.02a00010"", ""10.1080/13569783.2010.512184"", ""10.1177/107780049700300302"", ""10.1080/13691457.2020.1805587"", ""10.1080/13569783.2019.1604123"", ""10.1080/13691457.2015.1022712"", ""10.18848/2324-7576/CGP/v15i02/67-80"", ""10.1080/00131881.2021.1945476"", ""10.1386/ijcm.3.1.121/7"", ""10.1080/13569783.2011.572370"", ""10.1177/1473325012464384"", ""10.1177/1077800411425149"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-8816-8_12"", ""10.1080/13569783.2015.1068109"", ""10.5209/rev_CUTS.2016.v29.n1.49243"", ""10.1386/atr_00053_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"
10.3366/jbctv.2022.0628,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,Bringing 'the whole world on to the British screen': Back Projection and British Film Studios in the 1930s and 1940s,"Back projection was a technique used particularly in the 1930s and 1940s to create the impression that film stars had been on location when in fact a camera recorded them in a studio acting in front of previously shot location footage projected onto a screen from behind. This article discusses its application in British studios, highlighting the contribution of key technicians to its development and refinement. Key examples are explored to show that a variety of approaches were used in different genres including thrillers, musicals and comedies. The technique’s novelty in films such as Rome Express (1932) and as used by Alfred Hitchcock in Young and Innocent (1937) brings out the multiple uses it could perform, as well as enabling theoretical reflection on reading sequences that deployed back projection. It is argued that back projection was one effect among many that were being developed and that in many cases these were mutually supportive. The article notes the keen contemporary interest in how films were made as studio correspondents recorded interesting cases of back-projected footage. In wartime and in the immediate postwar years the technique helped to cut costs and solve logistical problems while at the same time enabling films to present scenes that would otherwise have been highly difficult and even dangerous. Although travelling matte and other effects and processes subsequently superseded the use of back projection, its legacy remains as an enduring technical and aesthetic element of many classic and lesser-known British films.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Street"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/screen/hjv004"", ""10.5040/9781350986527"", ""10.1093/screen/hjz006"", ""10.1525/fq.2007.60.3.3"", ""10.2307/j.ctv125jsnh.9"", ""10.7560/781566"", ""10.1353/cj.2012.0000""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Employing Michel Chion’s concept of acousmatic voice, the article first explores the role of the telephone in creating both narrative suspense and diegetic cohesion. It then investigates how the film implicitly establishes a pattern of resemblance between the telephonic and cinematic mediums centred on their capacities for diffusion and disembodiment. Finally, the article explores the meta-cinematic implications of its preceding findings, arguing that the fears and anxieties associated with the telephone in Black Christmas ultimately concern cinema itself and its possible cultural impact. Although it attempts to enforce certain categories of knowledge and identity, Black Christmas ultimately engages with cinema’s capacity for subverting rather than enforcing ideology.","[{""name"": ""Morten Feldtfos Thomsen"", ""affiliation"": [""Karlstad University ( Sweden )""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-8705.2011.00037.x"", ""10.1515/9783839410912-022"", ""10.1017/9789048523443.012"", ""10.1215/00382876-1275752"", ""10.1093/screen/32.2.184"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190916237.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1097184X01003004002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195335910.001.0001"", ""10.1525/fq.2003.56.4.23"", ""10.1515/9783839410912-023""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"
10.1017/S0266464X20000780,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,Body and Gesture in Derek Walcott's Theatre,"Reflecting on Derek Walcott’s early relationship with movement, dance and ritual, this article sheds light on the centrality of embodied memory in Walcott’s work for the stage and reflects on the relationship between memory and materiality in his epistemology of performance. Walcott’s ideas shaped his approach to dramaturgy in the late 1950s and position his work in relation to global debates around materialism (Brecht) and ritualism (Grotowski) in the theatre. A discussion of two plays, Dream on Monkey Mountain and Pantomime, examines the use of gestural language in specific performances of each. Such an approach demonstrates that the importance of embodied memory, as reflected in the staging of these plays, relates to certain Afro-Caribbean belief systems, which have exerted much influence on Walcott’s work.

The printed marginalia in the 1573 edition not only are annotations that speak from the margins of the possible performance of the text but can also be read as a sign of cross-fertilization between coexisting types of drama. The marginalia in the 1575 edition clearly aim at readers of the playbook rather than at spectators of future performances. In this sense, they are unlikely Gascoigne’s originals, but the result of interventions by those involved in the volume’s printing. The article explores how the printed marginalia in these two editions of Gascoigne’s Supposes suggest intriguing relations between the play’s textual and performative dimensions.","[{""name"": ""Cristiano Ragni"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

10.3366/film.2020.0146,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,Becoming-Flashdrive: The Cinematic Intelligence of Lucy,"An important but easily forgotten moment in the history of film-philosophy is Jean Epstein's assertion that cinema, more than merely thinking, has a kind of intelligence. If it is a newfound conception of rationality that is needed for any contemporary ethical relation to the world, as thinkers from Reza Negarestani and Pete Wolfendale to feminist collective Laboria Cuboniks have espoused in their respective neo-rationalist projects, then cinema as a thinking thing must be interrogated in its relation to reason. A somatophilia of purely affective and phenomenological approaches in film theory alongside micropolitical injunctions to undermine common-sense and liberate one's desire in extremity can fall limp in view of such calls for universal thinking around rationality. To understand cinema's specific form of intelligence, this article will explore Luc Besson's Lucy (2014) as an instance of how film is able to represent intelligence. Besson's film provides a site where Western cultural anxieties and assumptions around intelligence are manifested. This will allow an explication of contemporary approaches to intelligence in philosophy whilst confronting these discourses with the insidious problematics of gender and race that undergird the film. I argue that Lucy shares many of its ambitions with the emerging vectors of thought associated with the neo-rationalist perspective in its engaging with a rethinking of universal values and the Promethean possibilities of human action. Reading the film through these philosophies will help position the ethical stakes it sets up, but also to distinguish it from a trend of contemporary “posthuman” films that it finds itself in company with. While it is certainly true that posthuman themes, as well as transhumanist fantasies, seem to permeate Besson's film, this article will incorporate another neologism, taken from neo-rationalist thinkers, in order to emphasise moments that can be productive from the standpoint of a philosophical account of intelligence: “rationalist inhumanism.”","[{""name"": ""Laurence Kent"", ""affiliation"": [""King's College London""]}]","[""10.2307/j.ctvfjczmk"", ""10.1057/9781137430328_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-33196-2_10"", ""10.1080/0969725X.2019.1568734"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-33196-2"", ""10.1017/9789048513840.011"", ""10.7312/mala18736"", ""10.1002/9781119100744.ch23"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748638178.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09502380601164353"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-33196-2_11"", ""10.3828/sfftv.2018.4"", ""10.3366/film.2018.0087"", ""10.1017/S1478572215000201"", ""10.1057/9780230294851_2"", ""10.1080/0969725X.2019.1568733""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Cultural Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.3366/jobs.2020.0282,JOURNAL OF BECKETT STUDIES,0502 Foreign Language and Literature; 1303 Drama Film and Television,Beckettian Pedagogies: Learning through Samuel Beckett,"This essay considers what it might mean to learn ‘through’ Beckett, inaugurating a critical pedagogy that could be called ‘Beckettian’. By integrating existing strands of scholarship on Beckett and his relationship to education, the essay draws a distinction between the ‘practical’ and ‘biographical’ ways of thinking about Beckett and learning. This draws on previous work within the field, but also proposes a new vocabulary – derived from an interdisciplinary encounter with the scholarship of teaching and learning and the philosophy of education, especially ‘critical pedagogy’ – through which the possibility of ‘Beckettian pedagogies’ might be manifested. Recalling Beckett's biographers, his work's fundamental silence haunts most attempts to contain, explain, avoid or domesticate it. The essay proposes that a critical pedagogy of Beckett must be grounded in the concept of openness, especially in the notion that ‘void’ is a productive category, and in the embodiment of an evolving ecology of praxis. This alternative pathway reflects on the philosophy of education inherent within Beckett as an idea, engaging with ‘Beckettian pedagogies’ in an entangled sense of instruction, guidance and teaching with a particular focus on the latter in terms of the theory or principles of education. This move does not require abandoning existing traditions, but rather gathering them under new light, by placing the biographical Beckett (1906–89) in juxtaposition with the praxis of Beckett (ongoing) and the contemporaneous notion of critical pedagogy, as expounded by several scholars including Paulo Freire (1921–97). Beckettian pedagogies therefore remove dormant assumptions, habits of mind, and hierarchies that impede exploration to enable a move away from the curriculum, or toward a curriculum of unlearning and uncertainty, thereby disrupting the entrenched powers that Beckett saw fit to resist.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan Heron"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicholas Johnson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1208787"", ""10.4324/9780203846179"", ""10.1007/s10912-016-9383-7"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_595042"", ""10.1177/105382590502800205"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2019.05.012"", ""10.3366/jobs.2014.0083"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107587977"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-8224-5"", ""10.5040/9781472511072"", ""10.47925/2013.053"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511607417"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521413664.011"", ""10.1080/10486801.2017.1405393"", ""10.1017/9781108284011"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521413664"", ""10.23987/sts.61030"", ""10.3366/jobs.2018.0225"", ""10.1162/0011526054622015"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-20786-5"", ""10.1215/9780822385318"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2019.03.014"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.11.005"", ""10.1007/s11217-005-1287-3""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The year 2023 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the coup that toppled the socialist government of Salvador Allende on September 11, 1973. To reflect on the role of film and media in relation to the coup demands a move away from mere commemoration and, more broadly, from memory studies as the overarching critical framework that has dominated studies of Chilean cinema. This Special Focus section seeks to move beyond memory without neglecting the duty to remember. It is a project of reactivation, reappropriation, and repoliticization of the cinematic memory of the coup. This approach favors continuities between films made throughout the last five decades under different historical moments—the socialist years of Allende, the dictatorship, the postdictatorship, and the estallido social (social uprising) of October 2019.","[{""name"": ""José Miguel Palacios"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This study examines more specifically the formal and discursive implications in Robichaud’s work between a first season that was produced for the independent community website Lez Spread the Word (LSTW) and a second season that was broadcast on the largest digital broadcasting platform in Quebec – Tou.tv. The visibility of a multiplicity of queer subjectivities certainly made history in Quebec television. However, by paying particular attention to the production budgets of seasons 1 and 2 as well as to their distribution space and by carrying out a comparative analysis of the narrative structures and images of lesbian characters in seasons 1 and 2 through the lens of the Queer Art of Failure (Halberstam), this article gives a better understanding of the programming of this series as “prized content” (Lotz) for season 1 and as “lesbian multicasting” (Himberg) for season 2.

The Role of Cinematic Evolution in the Flynn Effect,"Abstract IQ tests have charted massive gains over the last century, known as the Flynn Effect. Over the same period, the time society spends with screens has massively increased and intensified, for example, shorter and closer shots, increasing narrative complexity. In Movies on our Minds (2021), James Cutting suggests a potential bidirectional link between the two effects: generational increase in visual processing abilities led to movie makers increasing the demands their movies place on viewer cognition, which in turn has trained societal visual processing capacity. In this commentary we review the evidence for such a positive association. The evidence indicates that increasing screen time may be associated with faster visual processing but also a potentially decreased ability to process this information (i.e., reduced executive functions). Further, effects may be dependent on the type of screen experience (e.g., developmental appropriateness of content and delivery platform such as TikTok) and other environmental considerations (e.g., socioeconomic status, parenting), suggesting that the factors influencing our evolving media/mind niche may be more complex than originally proposed.","[{""name"": ""Tim J.

10.1215/02705346-10013660,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Appropriate Feminisms: Ambivalence and Citational Practice in Appropriate Behavior,"Abstract Across her body of work in film, television, and digital media, Desiree Akhavan has captured the awkward politics of cultural production for female filmmakers and media-makers. Yet she has also refused to straightforwardly align her work with feminist critiques of dominant cultural production practices, however much she is interpellated by them. Akhavan, a queer woman of color in a racist, sexist, and homophobic industry, negotiates both contemporary feminism's potentials for solidarity and its intersectional shortcomings. Akhavan's autobiographical characters wrestle with the need for social justice while questioning the “appropriate behaviors” demanded by serious commitments to the cause. Her work reveals the ambivalence of feminist attachments. This article reads the queer feminist politics of Akhavan's work, with a particular focus on her debut feature Appropriate Behavior (UK/US, 2014), through the lens of citational practice. The author argues that Akhavan employs citational codes that function in Clare Hemmings's words as a “storytelling tactic,” sustaining normative narratives about feminism's recent past. By employing an ambivalent trope that the author calls citation→disavowal, Akhavan troubles both the dominant cultures she is excluded from and the viability and legibility of her place within the movements that resist them.","[{""name"": ""Clara Bradbury-Rance"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Gender Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

However, a critical observation indicated that the media were not doing much more than government propaganda. The focus of this study is to analyse the ideology that drives the Kenyan mainstream media. The research particularly focuses on the study of photographs that were published in Kenya’s two leading newspapers, the Daily Nation and The Standard, between 15 March and 30 April 2020, to decode the ideological meanings hidden in the photographs. This study is guided by these three research questions: how is the fight against COVID-19 photographically represented in Kenyan newspapers? What mythic meanings are embedded in these photographs? What ideological nuances can be read in these photographs? The analysis used Roland Barthes’s framework of semiotic analysis. Findings show that the photographs published in the two newspapers in the period of study support the dominant government ideology and promote gender and class inequality.","[{""name"": ""Joseph N.

10.3138/md-64-3-1116,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,An Invitation from the Displaced: Refuge Restaged in The Jungle and As Far as My Fingertips Take Me,"Tania El Khoury’s audience-of-one performance piece As Far as My Fingertips Take Me and Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson’s play The Jungle, produced and developed by Good Chance, are twenty-first-century productions that foreground the medial affordances of performance art and drama to foreground Western audiences’ relationships and responses to refugees. I propose a taxonomy of the strategies used in these two works as a model for analyzing theatre and performance about refugees. These strategies are classified in terms of the responses they seek to elicit from the audience, and my analysis explores some of the tactics used to achieve these goals. Remedial strategies counter harmful stereotypes about refugees; transformative strategies challenge and reshape basic conceptions of self, other, nation, and citizenship; and ethotic strategies reorient the audience to consider their relationship with refugees, particularly with respect to their disparate identity positions, mutual responsibility, and interdependence. Fingertips and The Jungle are substantially different artworks but are able to achieve similar results by utilizing the different affordances of their respective mediums. Thus, the taxonomy of strategies provides a more systematic and precise way of analyzing how refugee drama and performance achieve their goals. It avoids being overly prescriptive in how these goals should be achieved and instead recognizes how exploiting different tactics and medial affordances can advocate for refugees and other migrants.","[{""name"": ""Jeff Casey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv13xprtw.22"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41773-4_5"", ""10.1386/peet_00011_7"", ""10.1386/peet.3.2.209_7"", ""10.1080/13528165.2015.1071049"", ""10.1215/08992363-3511586"", ""10.1515/9781400826698"", ""10.4135/9781452233222"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11351.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jrs/fep021"", ""10.1525/can.1996.11.3.02a00050"", ""10.2307/j.ctv13xprtw.21"", ""10.5040/9781474295635""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

10.3366/jbctv.2023.0665,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,Alma's (Not) Normal: Normalising Working-Class Women in/on BBC TV Comedy,"This article examines the BBC sitcom Alma's Not Normal and its representation of white working-class femininities in/on British TV comedy. After The Royle Family creator Caroline Aherne's death in July 2017, the BBC created a bursary in memory of the comedy star, awarding £5,000 to the successful applicant to develop a pilot comedy script. Though open to people of all backgrounds and genders, the three winners so far have been working-class women – Sophie Willan, Amy Gledhill and Kiri Pritchard-McLean – an important shift from the recent success of female-fronted and female-authored middle-class comedies on the BBC such as Miranda and Fleabag. This article examines the award's first winner: Boltonian Sophie Willan and her series Alma's Not Normal. While Phil Wickham argues that contemporary working-class sitcoms in Britain display the ‘hidden injuries of class’, something that is felt but no longer acknowledged, I contend that Willan exposes class wounds by explicitly referencing and drawing attention to social issues in her TV series. More specifically, I argue that, as a working-class woman in the North West, Willan uses comedy to interrogate the intersections of class and gender. This textual analysis will then be used as a framework to conceptualise the labour of working-class women in British television comedy, mainly because class has been overlooked as a social category in contemporary scholarship on feminism and humour.","[{""name"": ""Laura Minor"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1470785321991346"", ""10.1177/1527476409338197"", ""10.1057/s41293-016-0034-4"", ""10.1386/jptv.4.2.199_1"", ""10.1177/0038038516629917"", ""10.3366/JBCTV.2006.3.1.72"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-23275-8"", ""10.7227/CST.2.1.4"", ""10.1177/1527476418777838"", ""10.4324/9781315387987-2"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-59449-5_8"", ""10.1080/10350330903565758"", ""10.4324/9780203022566"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479885459.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0038038505058381"", ""10.1017/S1537592709992842"", ""10.1080/14680770701824779"", ""10.5040/9781350222359"", ""10.1215/02705346-3592565"", ""10.5040/9781350222526.ch-008"", ""10.1057/9781137492852_6"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-55506-9_14""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Gender Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

10.1215/02705346-8838613,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Agnes Varda: Photography and Early Creative Process,"Abstract Agnès Varda frequently presented her career as encompassing three domains: photography, cinema, and visual art. While her cinema and late-career artistic work are widely accessible, her early photography remains a growing area of study. Moreover, it has often been repeated that Varda began her directorial career with little knowledge of cinema (stories Varda herself echoed). This article excavates little-known 1950s photographic studies from her archives to show how, in her early cinematic career, she utilized her training as a photographer to conceive her early films. The article demonstrates that Varda made extensive scouting photographs to plan the shots and motifs of her first film, La Pointe Courte (France, 1954), and sometimes sketched these compositions directly in her shooting script. The article also features photographs she made to develop themes in L'Opéra Mouffe (Diary of a Pregnant Woman, France, 1958). Photography, the author argues, enabled Varda to work aesthetically and economically, realizing these early films without the support of producers or state subsidies. Her photographs reveal her formal composition and thematic concerns; they also demonstrate the stunning scope of her planning and enable new understandings of her early creative process.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca J.

10.1386/jsca_00011_1,JOURNAL OF SCANDINAVIAN CINEMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Acts of remembering, acts of forgetting: Architecture, memory and recovery in Oslo, August 31st","This article examines the ways Joachim Trier represents memory in Oslo, 31. august (Oslo, August 31st) (2011), arguing that the film depicts a conflict between an individual’s attempt to forget (through addiction recovery) and the persistence of cultural memory. The film centres on Anders’s inability to move on from his addiction and imagine a future for himself in the face of an overabundant archive of cultural memory that situates him as an addict. One of the techniques Trier uses to represent the omnipresence of this ‘mnemonic energy’ on-screen is to visually associate memory with Oslo’s urban landscape, revealing the ways architecture ‘frames’ and circumscribes Anders’s attempt at constructing a new self through recovery. By depicting the individual’s interface with cultural memory as an immersive experience of wandering through a modern cityscape dominated by architectural structures, Trier shows how difficult recovery can be for an individual embedded within them.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Bigelow"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368657 University of Minnesota""]}]","[""10.1515/9783110207262.2.97"", ""10.1386/jsca_00011_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

In doing so, it gave audiences the opportunity to laugh at the assumptions of “gaydar”: the notion that you can make a connection between gender nonconformity and sexuality. This article explores how the landscape of queer and trans representation in film and TV has shifted in the intervening decades, arguing that the reading and misreading of gendered codes remains a structuring condition of the queer comedy. If mainstream media of the past decade have strategically pursued femininity as the visible symbol of lesbian progress, other media have instead ambivalently negotiated a double bind: a resistance to accepting masculinity as the straightforward condition of lesbian legibility and a simultaneous anxiety over the precarity of lesbianism itself.","[{""name"": ""Clara Bradbury-Rance"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

This article explores A24’s “winning formula” for Asian American prestige, a package of discourses around race, independent film, and Asian American representation that appeals to both Oscar voters and Asian American filmgoers ready to venerate the films on social media and in journalistic writing. Specifically, in its advertising and other paratextual materials, A24 uses discourses of cultural authenticity, often around familiar and legible narratives of Asian immigrant families, to position these films as “quality” works worthy of official recognition.

The film retains large parts of the literary plot as well as its focalization through the troll-protagonist Tina/Reva. At the same time, Border introduces significant modifications. I argue that by expanding the plot to include a number of new elements and amplifying Lindqvist’s strategy of ‘a shimmering movement’, including the experience of transness and identity as change, Abbasi’s film disrupts more forcefully our ideas about the human/nonhuman divide, sex and gender dualism, aesthetics, ethics and other normative regimes regulating our social and human lives. By examining the film as a post-celluloid adaptation, I show how Border incorporates Lindqvist’s critique of technology while also embracing the imaginative and affective possibilities of digital cinema to interrogate the responsibilities of humanity from a posthumanist perspective.","[{""name"": ""Anna Estera Mrozewicz"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000120973545 Adam Mickiewicz University""]}]","[""10.1080/25785273.2019.1682229"", ""10.1086/495695"", ""10.1215/10642684-4-2-145"", ""10.1386/jsca_00035_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

However, a rigorous review of the benefits of DvT has not been conducted. The purpose of this study was to review extant literature for the observed benefits of DvT, identify gaps in the literature and make recommendations concerning future research including identifying possible areas for outcome measurement for preliminary studies. The authors, who each completed training in this approach, conducted a scoping review of English-language, published, peer-reviewed and grey DvT literature through 2021. From an initial 745 records retrieved through databases and a manual search, 51 publications met criteria, which, when analysed using in-vivo and pattern coding, resulted in a total of seventeen categories of observed benefits ascribed to DvT. These included six general categories – relational, emotional, social, cognitive, behavioural and physical benefits – and eleven complex categories of benefits to participants across the lifespan. In addition to benefits for participants, benefits of DvT were also observed and reported for facilitators, therapists, teachers and supervisors engaged in this practice. This review revealed inconsistencies regarding the reporting of practitioner training, frequency, format, population, intended goals, assessment measures and outcomes. Future studies with increased experimental rigor, standardized outcome measures and consistent reporting are recommended.","[{""name"": ""Nisha Sajnani"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368753 New York University""]}, {""name"": ""Marc Willemsen"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000108249343 HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht""]}, {""name"": ""Jason D.

This coalition created tensions among the five countries, exacerbating an already simmering conflict between Tanzania and Rwanda involving the expulsion of ‘illegal’ Rwandan migrants from Tanzania. Informed by contemporary political communication and media framing, this article examines how these events were framed in five leading newspapers in East Africa: theDaily Nation(Kenya), theDaily Monitor(Uganda),The Citizen(Tanzania),The New Times(Rwanda) andThe East African(EAC region). Through a thematic frame analysis, we interrogate the prevalence and implications of five prominent themes found in most political conflicts (attributions of responsibility, conflict, human interest, economic consequences and morality) on the ‘Coalition of the Willing’ media debate. The analysis reveals conflicting frames with a potential to inflame antagonistic media debates to the integration efforts – by the resultant blame-game and opening up of historical wounds and personal differences, among the key players.","[{""name"": ""Joseph Njuguna"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000091467108 Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Margaret Jjuuko"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000406202260 University of Rwanda""]}]","[""10.1177/107769900007700308"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01304.x"", ""10.1177/0002716293528001009"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00622.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051452"", ""10.1080/10584609.1993.9962963"", ""10.1111/j.0021-9916.2007.00326.x"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2000.tb02843.x"", ""10.1177/1940161209351004"", ""10.1177/1748048513482266"", ""10.1080/13501769780000011"", ""10.30958/ajmmc.1-4-2"", ""10.1386/jams_00022_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

By adopting his findings on the medical and economic use of crisis, a delayed discourse surfaces regarding singers and singing. Concepts of crisis as choosing between alternatives, such as trust in vocal technique or medical treatment, flexibility or specialization in repertoire, have been established and maintained. However, the most recent developments make it necessary to consider the uncertainties instead of alternatives, as well as the shifting organizational and networking aspects of the opera industry, with artist managers and agents in special, triadic relations of varying order with the opera companies and the singers. Especially with the economic pressures on the opera companies increasing, the singers’ agencies are in a key position of securing engagements and career developments.","[{""name"": ""Sebastian Stauss"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000041936973X Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität""]}]","[""10.1177/016344378200400104"", ""10.14361/zkmm-2019-0106"", ""10.1386/smt_00033_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Music'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Supplementing Karl Schoonover's theory of brutal humanism with Lacanian gaze theory, I argue that the Berlin International Film Festival's synopsis of a recent cause célèbre of Italian cinema, Fuocoammare (Fire at Sea) (Rosi, 2016), instantiates a 'brutal vision' directed towards the figure of the refugee, while the film text's depiction of the 'objective gaze' of these characters challenges such relations of power and looking. The article underlines the importance of competitive European film festivals and paratexts in the international circulation and ideological construction of Italian cinema, while arguing that the film text itself can offer a site of resistance to the meanings that institutions ascribe to it.","[{""name"": ""Rachel Johnson"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368403 University of Leeds""]}]","[""10.1179/0261434015Z.000000000115"", ""10.1386/jicms.4.1.127_7"", ""10.1179/0075163414Z.00000000081"", ""10.1080/13688790.2015.1191983"", ""10.1080/13688790.2015.1191981"", ""10.1386/jicms.6.1.33_1"", ""10.1093/screen/16.3.6"", ""10.1080/1354571X.2011.530767"", ""10.1386/jicms.6.1.3_2"", ""10.1386/jicms_00005_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

At Anglo-Amalgamated he oversaw a varied slate of productions, from B-movies and cheap programmers to box-office successes like Ken Loach’s Poor Cow. He greenlit some of the greatest commercial hits of the 1960, including New Wave dramas ( Billy Liar, A Kind of Loving), pop musicals ( Catch Us If You Can) and horror films now widely considered to be classics of British cinema ( Peeping Tom). After Anglo-Amalgamated was acquired as part of EMI’s takeover of the Associated British Pictures Corporation (ABPC), Cohen headed Anglo-EMI, where his business acumen and shrewd commercial instincts led to him being dubbed ‘King Cohen’ by the press and widely recognised as one of the most powerful men in the British film industry. Drawing on recent scholarly work on the role of the producer, this article will explore links between Anglo-ABPC and EMI through the lens of Cohen’s career and distinctive ‘movie mogul’ persona.","[{""name"": ""Laura Mayne"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01439685.2016.1220765"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94803-4"", ""10.1057/9780230304666"", ""10.5040/9781501300202""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Through close readings of photographs by visual artist and documentary photographer Sheba Chhachhi, who documented the struggle for women’s rights in India from the 1980s onward, this article outlines the political stakes of documentary photography’s formal conventions. First, it analyzes candid snapshots of recent protests for women’s rights in India, focusing on an iconic photograph by Chhachhi of Satyarani Chadha, a community organizer and women’s rights activist, at a rally in New Delhi in 1980. It attends to the way in which such photographs turn personal scenes of mourning into collective memorials to militancy, even as they embalm their subjects in a state of temporal paralysis and strip them of their individual history. It contrasts these snapshots to Chhachhi’s collaborative portrait of Chadha from 1990, a “feminist still” that deploys formal conventions of stillness to stage temporal encounters between potential histories and unrealized futures. Throughout, the article returns to the untimeliness of Chhachhi’s photography, both in the multiple temporalities opened up within the image and in its avant-garde critique of feminist politics through experiments with photographic form.","[{""name"": ""Lakshmi Padmanabhan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1093/adaptation/apaa007,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,A Black Sherlock Holmes (1918): A Case Study in Racebending,"AbstractWith hundreds of Sherlock Holmes screen adaptations, the silent all-Black-cast A Black Sherlock Holmes (1918) remains an under-researched anomaly. The essay provides an overview of colourblind and colour conscious casting practices, ultimately advocating for adopting fan studies approaches to ‘racebending’. Racebending involves alternately ‘racing’ canonical characters from white to Black Minority Ethnic. After briefly reviewing representations of African Americans in blackface minstrelsy and early twentieth-century race films, the essay argues that A Black Sherlock Holmes highlights the ways in which race filmmakers were trying to reimagine new ways for African Americans to become part of dominant literary culture. In reimagining Sherlock Holmes as an African American, the film (re)inscribes Black people into prominent literary and cultural history. Because Knick Garter is doubly descended from two notable fictional detectives, America’s Nick Carter of dime novel fame as well as Britain’s legendary Sherlock Holmes, his very existence posits a new world where famous Black characters are as much a part of the American literary landscape as canonical characters from Hawthorne, Poe, and Twain. Viewing A Black Sherlock Holmes in light of the possibilities the film offers, rather than its limitations, allows viewers today to see the ways literary history, film, and race coalesced to highlight the possibilities of radical racial change in the post-Reconstruction era at the beginning of the twentieth century.","[{""name"": ""Ann McClellan"", ""affiliation"": [""Plymouth State University""]}]","[""10.4324/9781315692753"", ""10.3998/mpub.368267"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674735590.c8"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226278735.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.1111/1542-734X.00013"", ""10.1177/1367877911422862"", ""10.1353/jer.2017.0024"", ""10.1525/tph.2016.38.1.89"", ""10.2307/j.ctv7r43q4"", ""10.1177/0021934713516860"", ""10.1093/screen/24.2.2"", ""10.1525/9780520936409"", ""10.1177/0021934713516860"", ""10.1162/10542040051058492"", ""10.1177/0042085911413150"", ""10.4324/9781315779829"", ""10.4324/9781315563886-4"", ""10.1353/cal.1998.0096"", ""10.1353/tt.0.0050""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

'It is a lewd goblin': Taking Critical Cues from Illustrative Adaptations of Christina Rossetti's Goblin Market,"Abstract When adapters interpret a work over and over again, they focus on details that can shape the way we think about a text. Focusing on these adaptive details can often lead to seeing gaps in the criticism of a text. Such is the case with Goblin Market, a poem that critics have been noting is ‘ambiguous’ since its first publication in 1862. While most critics understand that this ambiguity centres on the sexual undertones of the poem, the key to understanding this allegory might be discovered by turning to illustrative adaptations. In all illustration, one detail is reproduced consistently: the goblins are visualised as animals. Yet animality is rarely discussed in criticism of the poem, and almost never with any depth. I argue that we can view adaptation as a type of meaning-making that literary and cultural critics might build upon when analysing familiar texts.","[{""name"": ""Kristen Layne Figgins"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, Kimpel Hall 333, 1 University of Arkansas , Fayetteville, AR 72701 , USA""]}]","[""10.1353/vct.2014.0012"", ""10.1163/18765610-02203004"", ""10.1353/vp.2017.0028"", ""10.1057/9780230286009"", ""10.1353/vp.2006.0003"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.1353/chl.0.0373"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-58580-2_4"", ""10.1515/9781400830855"", ""10.1353/elh.2006.0031"", ""10.1017/S1060150317000365"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-56712-3"", ""10.4324/9781315690254-19"", ""10.3200/EXPL.65.4.219-222"", ""10.1353/vp.2012.0019""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

If a fugue is a composition based on a ‘subject’ or short melodic phrase and its various ‘answers’—in other words, variations that maintain elements of the melody but also play with and revise it—how might we position the film as a variation on, rather than a reproduction of, Caspary’s novel? To explore this question, we analyze the sonic register of both the novel and film. Caspary doesn’t want us to merely read her novel; she wants us to listen to the voices that narrate it and the tunes that populate it. Similarly, listening to the film—not simply the dialogue but also the voiceover narration and David Raksin’s groundbreaking score—allows us to identify content not overt in, and sometimes at odds with, the visuals. When we listen critically and carefully, we can distinguish nuances that get lost in a strict fidelity approach; in particular, we can identify both works’ feminist content, especially their attempts to decentre patriarchal hard-boiled conventions and to confound notions of a singular truth.","[{""name"": ""Margaret A Toth"", ""affiliation"": [""English Department, Manhattan College""]}, {""name"": ""Teresa Ramoni"", ""affiliation"": [""English Department, Rutgers University E-mail: teresa.ramoni@rutgers.edu""]}]","[""10.5749/j.ctt22727z1"", ""10.1353/nar.2003.0013"", ""10.1525/9780520914773"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-69338-5_3"", ""10.1525/9780520922815"", ""10.1525/9780520909663"", ""10.1111/jpcu.12505"", ""10.1353/cj.2008.0011"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apq001"", ""10.7560/TSLL60302"", ""10.1525/9780520921467""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

10.1386/jptv_00041_1,JOURNAL OF POPULAR TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,'The Same Trade as Mozart': Convincing the sceptics of electronic music's value,"In August 1969, the music documentary seriesWorkshop(1964–78) focused on electronic music in a 55-minute-long film titled ‘The Same Trade as Mozart’. Produced and directed by David Buckton, the film included interviews with composers Karlheinz Stockhausen, Tristram Cary and Justin Connolly; BBC Radiophonic Workshop staff Desmond Briscoe, David Cain and John Baker, and the Workshop’s founder, Daphne Oram; and Peter Zinovieff, director of EMS (Electronic Music Studios). It presented electronic music in a number of contexts, such as education, pop production and live performance. Technological change in music has often provoked hostility among the public and critics, and the rapid advancement of electronic music post-Second World War was no exception. Adopting a mode of analysis more commonly encountered in studies of the public communication of science, this article considers ‘The Same Trade as Mozart’ as an attempt by electronic music’s advocates, such as those listed above, to convince sceptics of its value. While sceptical responses to the presence of new technologies in music have been widely noted and theorized by scholars in science and technology studies, we call attention to the strategies employed by the advocates of such technologies to defend themselves against such criticisms, including humour, heuristic explanations and a focus on electronic music’s educational and thus social value. The use of computers in electronic music was a new and contentious development in the field, requiring a greater degree of advocacy from its proponents. We examine how the computer’s role in composition is presented in ‘The Same Trade as Mozart’, compared with other media portrayals of computing in the 1960s. Drawing on theories of filmed musical performance, we discuss how visual tropes of ‘classical’ music are used in ‘The Same Trade as Mozart’ to challenge preconceptions about the relationships between composers, musicians and new technologies.","[{""name"": ""Frances Morgan"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404204262 University of Lincoln""]}, {""name"": ""James Mooney"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368403 University of Leeds""]}]","[""10.1177/0306312704047171"", ""10.2307/937875"", ""10.2307/937711"", ""10.7227/CST.9.1.5"", ""10.2307/951824"", ""10.1558/pomh.v8i1.5"", ""10.1353/aq.2006.0059"", ""10.1017/S0261143010000449"", ""10.1353/tech.2003.0126"", ""10.1080/02690403.2016.1216059"", ""10.1386/jptv_00041_1""]","['Computer Science', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Music']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Although the volume is in private hands, scans of the annotated pages are freely available in the Beckett Digital Library of the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project. Compared to other surviving works by and on Shakespeare in Beckett’s possession, the Macbeth schoolboy copy shows an unusual abundance of reading traces and marginalia. However, passages that are not underlined or otherwise marked turn out to be equally important for an assessment of the play’s impact on Beckett’s writing, in addition to a grey zone of indeterminate or conceptual references that are harder to classify as allusions. This is especially the case when Beckett’s style becomes sparser, and he explores other dramatic genres such as radio or television alongside prose and theatre. By way of introduction, the article analyses some of these instances in more detail while providing more context about the book’s provenance.","[{""name"": ""Pim Verhulst"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dirk Van Hulle"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5040/9780571291571.40000008"", ""10.3138/md.15.2.223"", ""10.1215/00267929-25-3-346"", ""10.1163/18757405-022001002""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

10.1017/S0307883321000274,THEATRE RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,1303 Drama Film and Television,'Burn the Witch': Decadence and the Occult in Contemporary Feminist Performance,"This article introduces and theorizes ‘decadence’ as a key feature of Lauren Barri Holstein's performance Notorious (2017). The decadence of Holstein's work is approached in light of two main considerations: the spectacular presentation of witchcraft as an occult practice, and what Holstein ‘does’ with the staging of witches and witchcraft. Situated in light of performances associated with the neo-occult revival (Ivy Monteiro and Jex Blackmore), and a recent strand of feminist performance that revels in an aesthetics of trash, mess and excess (Ann Liv Young and Lucy McCormick), the article offers a close critical analysis of Notorious as a work that addresses and seeks to subvert gendered inequalities and forms of productivity in twenty-first-century capitalism. I argue that Holstein's overidentification with exertion and exhaustion as much as the subversive potentialities of witchcraft results in a decadent aesthetic, that her staging of the witch as a persecuted but powerful emblem of the occult sheds valuable light on the aesthetics and politics of decadence in performance, and that the subversive qualities of decadence emerge particularly strongly in its ‘doing’ as an embodied and enacted practice.","[{""name"": ""ADAM ALSTON"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/fr.2013.19"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190664473.001.0001"", ""10.1162/DRAM_a_00143"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6478.2004.00281.x""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Music']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

As a co-founder of the biennial Climate Change Theatre Action (CCTA), which is a growing international initiative to foster climate change awareness through the performance of very short plays commissioned from playwrights in dozens of countries, she has been dividing her time between coordinating theater-based activism, publishing, and curating a blog series on HowlRound.com, and writing short plays as well as an eight-part series of full-length dramas. As she argues in her 2015 article “In Search of a New Aesthetic,” it is necessary “to move beyond writing plays about climate change to writing plays that are climate change – plays that embody, in form, content, and process, the essence of the issues we are facing. Plays where the concept of climate change is so integral to the work that the term doesn’t even need to be uttered. New problems cannot be solved with old solutions. A new consciousness requires new artistic constructs.” On the eve of the CDE conference, Chantal Bilodeau spoke about her research-based creative process at a public event in downtown Graz. At the conference, she presented a keynote on how her work in climate change theater addresses crisis as an ongoing condition. This interview provides detailed insights into Bilodeau’s artistic concepts, theater practices, and climate change activism.","[{""name"": ""Nassim Winnie Balestrini"", ""affiliation"": [""University of GrazAustria""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

After an initial brief look at precursors, it then focuses on examples of new writing which tackle the idea of dystopia in the absurdist manner typical of the 2000 s. In a third step, the focus is on the dystopian drama of the 2010 s and its more conventionally structured plots, which at the same time increasingly include ironic and parodistic elements. It becomes clear how this comparatively new genre is able to shake off the constraints of traditional dystopian writing and develop recognisable characteristics of its own. Throughout, emphasis is put on the “reality” of the plays’ fictional worlds, on the usage of the stage space, and on how the audience’s relationship with the stage is constructed as a double bind of distance and closeness.","[{""name"": ""Aleks Sierz"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Paderborn Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Merle Tönnies"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Paderborn Germany""]}]","[""10.1017/CCOL9780521886659.005"", ""10.5040/9781350208520.00000003"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195136128.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315304953"", ""10.1515/jcde-2019-0006"", ""10.5040/9781408166819"", ""10.1515/jcde-2017-0012"", ""10.3138/md.50.3.325""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Reflecting on the five years since the publication of the author’s Theatre Journal article, “Feeling in Counterpoint” (2018), the article addresses how disciplinary formations work to enact harm on racialized and minoritized scholars in the field. Writing from the perspective of the field in the United Kingdom, the essay reflects on two significant moments in the author’s experience. First, the collective writing and publication of the open letter “White Colleague Listen!” in 2020, when UK theatre, dance, and performance studies scholars of the Global Majority articulated their experiences and desires for change in the field. Second, the author’s work of community building with the New Earth Performer’s Academy, a program for emerging East and Southeast Asian actors and performers. Between these two events, the essay argues that in order to transform itself, the field must come to terms with desire—in other words, scholars must be explicit about the desire that compels them toward their subject matter and their research.","[{""name"": ""Broderick Chow"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Music']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Yet with Trump’s recent endorsement of Vance for a Senate run, this reading of Vance’s text requires an update. One that looks to the larger context of hillbilly-themed representations. American eugenics offers such a view. For over 100 years the American eugenics movement used the hillbilly stereotype to justify its surveillance, categorization, institutionalization, and sterilization of what they called “defectives” in promoting its image of “whiteness.” Popular media was an integral part of these efforts. The foundational narrative of the American eugenics movement, Goddard’s 1912 text The Kallikaks is also the name of a hillbilly-themed sitcom produced in 1977. Utilizing Lisa Cartwright’s Screening the Body, Tracing Medicine’s Visual Culture, this article argues that the narrative of the hillbilly stereotype in American eugenics has been an integral part of cinema and television history, extending back to the motion studies.

Included here is an original translation of Murakawa's article as well as an introduction from the translator addressing how the gendered experiences of authorship, stardom, and ageism intersect in Tanaka's directorial career.","[{""name"": ""Hide Murakawa"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Urban Studies', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Elle s’appuie sur les exemples tirés de quatre films : The Pelican Brief ( L’Affaire Pélican) (1993), The Long Kiss Goodnight ( Souviens-toi Charlie) (1996), I, Robot ( Les Robots) (2004), et Hancock (2008). Le tabou hollywoodien auquel obéit la représentation d’histoires d’amour interraciales fait en sorte que les relations entre les deux personnages sont nécessairement asexuées ; l’analyse des textes mène l’auteure à la conclusion que ce sont les exigences qu’impose le rôle de compagnon romantique du personnage masculin qui limitent et circonscrivent la performance de genre du personnage féminin. Définissant quatre thèmes — similarité, intimité, flexibilité dans les rôles de genre et délimitation —, l’auteure montre que, dans la distanciation provisoire par rapport à l’hétéronormativité patriarcale représentée dans ces textes, les moments d’égalitarisme, d’intensité et d’intimité entre les personnages masculin et féminin sont possibles.

En los últimos años del franquismo habían surgido colectivos que defendían los derechos de los trabajadores a través de huelgas y manifestaciones. La Doctrina Social de la Iglesia también defendió sus derechos y algunos sectores cristianos participaron en las revueltas. El periodismo religioso de aquel momento tuvo presente este tema en su agenda. Así lo hizo Vida Nueva, uno de los semanarios de carácter social y religioso más reconocidos en la prensa católica. En esta investigación se analiza el movimiento obrero, los derechos sindicales y su impacto en la sociedad e Iglesia española a través de los editoriales de la revista Vida Nueva entre 1968 y 1975. Las conclusiones del trabajo indican las propuestas de la revista orientadas hacia la defensa del mundo obrero, la promoción de la libertad, la autonomía y la representatividad de los sindicatos.","[{""name"": ""Jesús Sánchez-Camacho"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ninfa Watt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""José David Urchaga-Litago"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5209/hics.64466"", ""10.1007/BF00734053"", ""10.1128/AEM.18.4.699-700.1969"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5827.1970.tb05585.x"", ""10.1002/food.19730170830"", ""10.1142/S0192415X75000025"", ""10.1080/00043389.1975.11760878"", ""10.17993/CcyLl.2018.15"", ""10.1128/AEM.18.4.699-700.1969"", ""10.1128/AEM.18.4.699-700.1969""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['History'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

She discusses how discussing racism has been continuously silenced by the white establishment: in the first part of the article, she reproduces an essay written in 2017, which was pulled from release by an online theatre publication for “turning off white readers” and “not being relevant since the Toronto theatre community isn’t racist.” In the second part, she includes reflections from September 2020, after the murder of George Floyd.

Baranoff-Rossine’s (1888–1944) optophonic art and the art of light and color invented by G. Gidoni (1895–1937). The achievements of the artists in the field of art synthesis are compared on several overlapping levels: concepts of new art forms they created; institutions they managed to partially implement, and projects of institutes they planned to realize; theoretical insights; light and color apparatus (optophone; light orchestra) and patents for the inventions. In her comparative analysis of the artists’ concepts, the author concludes that in their reference points, the ideas of Baranoff-Rossine and Gidoni were very close. The following provisions are common for the artists: contributing rhythm and dynamics to painting; bringing pictural art out of the plane onto a screen/transparent screen or into space; combining light and color with sound; bringing fine art closer to music. However, in their aspiration to bring light and color beyond the limits of pictural art (into time and space), they acted in different directions. In its operation principle, Baranoff-Rossine’s instrument was closer to cinematography (all colors and drawings were projected on the screen). Gidoni’s light and color device, which assumed no screen at all (the screen was implied to be transparent), was more of a theatrical thing. The artist dreamed of creating a light theater which would incorporate light music, light architecture, light declamation, and light choreography.","[{""name"": ""Olga V.

10.1017/S0040557421000193,THEATRE SURVEY,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Winstanley's ""Righteous Actors"": Performance, Affect, and Extraordinary Politics in the Seventeenth Century","On the first day of April 1649, on the predominantly rural manor of Walton, Surrey, the sight of people preparing land for the plow was unremarkable. To see men up at dawn, dressed for the field in broad-brimmed hats, homespun waistcoats, and short breeches, loosening or breaking up clods with their spades, stooping to toss aside root and rock, was typical. What did raise eyebrows, however, was the sight of such busyness on a Sunday, the Sabbath, and on no less remarkable ground than George Hill, with its “very barren,” sandy soil. When questioned, Gerrard Winstanley reframed this performative break with religious, social, and agricultural norms as he did in his soon to be published manifesto, The True Levellers’ Standard Advanced. To work this land was to “declare . . . by action,” as well as by word, that Winstanley, the self-described “prophet” William Everard, and a small number of others had been sent by the Creator to begin their mission of transforming “the Earth [into] a common Treasury for all, both Rich and Poor.” Rural, religious, and resource poor, the Digger collective has not received substantial attention from performance studies scholars. Even some historians of the seventeenth century have questioned the significance of this small, nonviolent agrarian group in the intensely “charged political atmosphere of the 1640s,” but as a collective whose theatrical social performances raised them from obscurity to national visibility, Diggers are in some ways the epitome of this era.","[{""name"": ""Ineke Murakami"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/03071029708567987"", ""10.1080/01440357.2014.914762"", ""10.1093/hwj/dbn029"", ""10.1080/01440357.2014.914756"", ""10.1080/01440357.2014.914751"", ""10.1080/01440357.2014.914753"", ""10.1080/01440359908586672"", ""10.1080/01440357.2014.914759"", ""10.1177/0263276404042133"", ""10.1353/sub.2002.0026""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Differentiation in German television's audience address,"Nostalgia is often examined as an element of the text. In this contribution, I argue that texts offer a number of spectator positions that can be perceived as nostalgic if the viewer has accumulated certain life experiences that render them so. Examining Babylon Berlin, I argue that the programme offers a spectator position that can look at its Weimar of 1929 anxiously and nostalgically. This is a spectator position that assumes a viewer who is likely to be from the former West and who likely is younger than 55 years of age.","[{""name"": ""Elke Weissmann"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000087947109 Edge Hill University""]}]","[""10.1093/screen/hjm049"", ""10.1017/S0008938920000771"", ""10.1515/commun-2019-2061"", ""10.1093/screen/hjq007"", ""10.1080/01956051.2013.805118"", ""10.1177/0163443715587872"", ""10.1386/jptv_00059_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Communication', 'Gender Studies', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

Academics and (un)cancelling the future,"In this essay, we consider the role of academics as change-makers. There is a long line of reflection about academics’ sociopolitical role(s) in international relations (IR). Yet, our attempt differs from available considerations in two regards. First, we emphasize that academics are not a homogenous group. While some keep their distance from policymakers, others frequently provide policy advice. Hence, positions and possibilities of influence differ. Second, our argument is not oriented towards the past but the future. That is, we develop our reflections on academics as change-makers by outlining the vision of a ‘FutureLab’, an innovative, future forum that brings together different world-makers who are united in their attempt to improve ‘the world'. Our vision accounts for current, perhaps alarming trends in academia, such as debates about the (in)ability to confront post-truth politics. Still, it is a (critically) optimistic one and can be read as an invitation for experimentation. Finally, we sympathize with voices demanding the democratization of academia and find that further cross-disciplinary dialogues within academia and dialogues between different academics, civil society activists and policymakers may help in finding creditable solutions to problems such as climate change and populism.","[{""name"": ""Leonie Holthaus"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Potsdam, Germany; Technical University Darmstadt, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Nils Stockmann"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science, University of Münster, Germany""]}]","[""10.1177/1354066115619018"", ""10.1007/s11558-016-9248-x"", ""10.1177/0967010618788996"", ""10.1002/eet.1777"", ""10.4324/9780203944691"", ""10.1017/S026021051500025X"", ""10.1177/03058298810100020501"", ""10.1515/wpsr-2014-0003"", ""10.1177/0010836716652429"", ""10.1177/0304375415612270"", ""10.1111/j.1528-3585.2012.00458.x"", ""10.3390/su11195357"", ""10.1017/S0020818309990142"", ""10.1080/21622671.2018.1510339"", ""10.1177/0305829812442234"", ""10.1111/dech.12287"", ""10.1093/isr/vix013"", ""10.5771/0946-7165-2014-2-85"", ""10.5771/0946-7165-2019-2-67"", ""10.1177/2336825X1902700206"", ""10.14512/gaia.27.4.10"", ""10.1177/0305829818774781"", ""10.1177/0967010612470295"", ""10.1177/0263774X18802954"", ""10.1080/0308514042000225716"", ""10.1111/j.1749-5687.2007.00031.x"", ""10.1080/13510347.2019.1613980"", ""10.1177/2336825X1802600306"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00651.x"", ""10.1177/0020702017740159"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12367"", ""10.1177/0047117816644662"", ""10.1017/S0260210520000091"", ""10.1177/0047117817691350"", ""10.1038/nj7322-467a"", ""10.1111/glob.12007"", ""10.1177/2336825X1602400201"", ""10.1177/0047117818774720"", ""10.1080/14494035.2018.1488796"", ""10.1017/S026021050011856X"", ""10.1017/S0260210509008377"", ""10.1080/23802014.2017.1359064"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-27990-5"", ""10.1177/1354066115580137"", ""10.4324/9781315099118-26"", ""10.1177/0170840610374405""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Introducing a flexible map of translation and interpreting phenomena,"Abstract Although so-called ‘non-professionals’ are no longer instrumentalised in research solely in order to compare and contrast them with ‘professionals’, this does little to change the lasting perception of two clearly demarcated categories. Such a differentiation may be meaningful in some contexts, but it often over-simplifies and certainly perpetuates a hierarchical order. In my contribution, I will present an alternative, flexible typology in the form of a map that tries to take into account the multifaceted variety of interpreting and translation phenomena that we encounter in social practice. This typology is based on the empirical insight that a binary differentiation between ‘professional’ and ‘non-professional’ translation or interpreting is not always sufficient to capture adequately the complexity of empirical practice.","[{""name"": ""Nadja Grbić"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Graz""]}]","[""10.1075/btl.122.02alo"", ""10.1080/13556509.2008.10799248"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6352.001.0001"", ""10.7202/002900ar"", ""10.1075/btl.73"", ""10.7202/003000ar"", ""10.1075/target.11.1.02hal"", ""10.1057/9781137025487_7"", ""10.1016/B978-008044612-7/50056-1"", ""10.1075/ts.6.1.04hok"", ""10.1075/btl.23.09mos"", ""10.1075/btl.40.09mos"", ""10.1075/btl.43.14nis"", ""10.1177/0095399707304434"", ""10.1075/btl.70.11per"", ""10.1075/z.56.33poc"", ""10.7202/003847ar"", ""10.4324/9780203504802"", ""10.1075/btl.141.13poc"", ""10.1080/13556509.1999.10799039"", ""10.1515/9783111351919"", ""10.1515/eujal-2015-0022"", ""10.6035/MonTI.2010.2.7"", ""10.1075/hts.4.tra16"", ""10.1075/z.38"", ""10.1177/0950017004040761"", ""10.4324/9781315644578"", ""10.1075/btl.4"", ""10.1075/btl.70.31bog"", ""10.1075/btl.5.16via"", ""10.1007/BF02408386""]","['Social Sciences', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

Often rooted in physical sites and material elements of domesticity-from live performances in bedrooms and kitchens to installations with textiles and food-their works orchestrate intimate situations where the meeting of performer and spectator doubles as an encounter between visitor and inhabitant, citizen and foreigner, guest and host. In doing so, the artists reveal how practices of hospitality-the everyday rituals through which ‘home’ is enacted and extended to others-serve to uphold cultural, patriarchal, and nationalist values, while simultaneously opening up space for their transformation.","[{""name"": ""Laura Levin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13528165.2004.10872062""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

In recent years, more and more Chinese film and television studios have sought to sell their products abroad, which has meant investing in translation. In order to project the image of a modern China with a rich cultural heritage, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) launched the ‘Sino-Africa Film and Television Cooperation Project’ to promote the translation and dissemination of Chinese films and television products in Africa. As a result, two models for this translation process have emerged: one government sponsored and one commercial. This article will use the translation of Chinese film and television programmes for Tanzania as a case study to analyse how each model is institutionally organized, their target audiences and approaches to distribution and the content of the resulting translations.","[{""name"": ""Haina Jin"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122371871 Communication University of China""]}]","[""10.47476/jat.v1i1.42"", ""10.2307/20202345"", ""10.1080/13696815.2016.1236720"", ""10.1386/jac_00025_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

This article focuses on another facet of that history, namely its impact on musicians employed in British cinemas. Much of the evidence is based on the records of the Musicians' Union and chronicles that organisation's attempts to resist the introduction of the new technology and to ameliorate its impact on its members. The musicians' side of the story is complemented by information drawn from, among other sources, The Bioscope, a trade paper that revealed the eagerness of the Cinematograph Exhibitors' Association (whose members comprised the managers and owners of British picture houses) to dismiss their orchestras as soon as practicable. The effect of this course of action was to increase the unemployment already resulting from the Great Depression in the British entertainment industries. This in turn weakened the Musicians' Union, forcing a severe contraction in its ability to support its members.","[{""name"": ""John Izod"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199797615.003.0014"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474420341.003.0010"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474420341.003.0005"", ""10.7765/9781526108289""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Film scholars and critics, especially those who tow the feminist line, keep bemoaning the manner in which patriarchy and male hegemony take centre stage in many Nollywood movies to the detriment of women. Employing the mixed research methodology (qualitative content analysis and key informant interview), this study explores the loud silence in women’s struggle for liberation in contemporary Nollywood narratives. Three widely acclaimed and contemporary movies – Muna (2019), Omo Ghetto: The Saga (2020) and Fine Wine (2021) – were content analysed to foreground and highlight male chauvinism and hegemony as well as women’s struggle for their liberation. Though women’s silence in the movies is as prolonged as it is loud, the fierce fight they later put up against male oppression comes as a great solace. Therefore, it is concluded that Nollywood film-makers should continue to give preeminence to such issues in subsequent narratives.","[{""name"": ""Osakpolor Emwinromwankhoe"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Thus, I aim at reconstructing the wider political plan to which these films were inscribed, locating them on the backdrop of the Polish Army propaganda activity and diplomacy in Italy in the eve of the Cold War. An in-depth inquiry into archival documentation concerning different contexts of the films shows them as a nodal point for a complex set of problems. I show to what extent these films were entangled into diplomatic, political and ideological struggles between the Polish Armed Forces, the Moscow-dependent Polish government, the Allies and the Italian government in the early post-war years. On a more general scale, this analysis uncovers the negotiations over boundaries of what was acceptable in the Second World War depiction in Italian film culture.","[{""name"": ""Karol Jóźwiak"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000097302769 University of Lodz""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-6563.1974.tb01535.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

10.3138/ctr.182.004,CANADIAN THEATRE REVIEW,1303 Drama Film and Television,What Is Lost and What Is Gained: A Travelogue of Tours of Hydro-Affected Communities in Northern Manitoba,"In 2014, Peter Kulchyski and Ramona Neckoway began touring hydro-impacted Ininew communities. This now annual hydro tour is an intense seven-day circuit filled with long drives, boat tours, discussion, revelation, outrage, and—above all—kindness and generosity. Relationships on the hydro tour involve engagement with bush dispositions, with ways of life developed in and through an engagement with the temporalities, spatialities, subjectivities, languages, and knowledges of egalitarian gathering and hunting peoples. In the city, hydroelectricity is taken for granted; it is seen through the possessive, instrumental rationality that underlines people’s roles as workers and citizens. This contrasts with the face-to-face encounters between community- and urban-based activists, artists, and academics that occur during the hydro tours. Those participating may witness Ininew performances and embodied practices that are both culturally specific and fundamentally human. The relationships developed on the hydro tour enact performances of care and vulnerability in which ethical concern responds to festering social wounds. Perceiving vulnerability and responding to it with care is labour, the work of relationship. Distribution of social wealth is unequal, raced, and gendered, yet it can be transformed through caring practice; such transformations require Ininew leadership.","[{""name"": ""Jessica Jacobson Konefall"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Kulchyski"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ramona Neckoway"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"
10.5325/arthmillj.16.2.0160,ARTHUR MILLER JOURNAL,1303 Drama Film and Television,What Did Playwright Arthur Miller Do to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice?,"abstract: Radio drama was a popular form of entertainment in the late 1930s and early 1940s. While Arthur Miller was struggling to make a place for himself as a playwright, he found financial security and an outlet for his talent by writing radio plays. He adapted Helen Jerome's Broadway script of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice for an hour-long radio play broadcast on 18 November 1945. The radio play captures some of the essence of the novel, but it is not Jane Austen. Neither is it representative of the best of Arthur Miller. This essay suggests that if Miller had written his radio play after writing his major plays, he could have captured the depth of Pride and Prejudice. The motifs found in Miller's plays suggest that even with the simpler story required of a radio play, there are the makings of a stronger adaptation in Miller's mature hands.","[{""name"": ""Sylvia Kasey Marks"", ""affiliation"": [""NYU Tandon School of Engineering""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

The article analyses Roberts’s adaptation, discussing more broadly the use of classic literary types such as the hardboiled detective and the western cowboy in social and political discourse. The article argues for the significance of adaptation studies in our polarized contemporary society because its valuing of change counters formulaic appropriations of the past and fixed ideas and models of experience. The essay suggests not only that political leaders mired in the past cannot adapt to changing society and social roles, but also that adaptation studies hones readers’ discernment, especially called for when public figures use fictional patterns to address real-world circumstances.","[{""name"": ""Julie Grossman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, Le Moyne College"", ""Department of Communication and Film Studies, Le Moyne College""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-05306-2"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521849624.005"", ""10.5040/9781501318757""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Greater entanglement has not been seized as an opportunity to make a better world but has rather led to heightened and pervasive vulnerability. States as well as private companies with private armed forces are in constant, often violent, competition with each other. Key features of this future are the weaponization of all aspects of interdependence as well as, technological developments, unchecked in their military applications and the resulting democratization of violence. By outlining a variety of morbid symptoms, we highlight the impact of the crisis on the international liberal order, states and societies. Tracking back the origins of such ‘crisis’, the authors argue that forsaking the fundamental principle of universality and taking regionalization of international governance to another step may serve as a solution for the approaching 720-degree security dilemma.","[{""name"": ""René Schlee"", ""affiliation"": [""Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, Prishtina Office, Kosovo""]}, {""name"": ""Jan Opper"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Hamburg, Germany""]}]","[""10.1080/00396338.2017.1375263"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00351"", ""10.1080/09636412.2015.1038188"", ""10.1177/0725513612445364"", ""10.1177/0022343317711242"", ""10.1017/9781108671019"", ""10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.t01-1-00312.x"", ""10.2307/1962764""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In addition to situating her own film practice in a Norwegian and international context, Haugsgjerd reflects on ethical issues pertaining to self-mediation, shares anecdotes that speak of the popular appeal of her films and discusses challenges and opportunities connected to making and distributing films like hers to national and international audiences.","[{""name"": ""Adriana Margareta Dancus"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000047417509X University of South-Eastern Norway""]}]","[""10.1386/jsca_00030_7""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

In this article, I investigate pandemic influence on depicting homeland, memory and locality in Sámi short films. The primary concern in the pre-2000 Sámi short films was the marginalization of Sámi culture, as well as tradition-modernization oppositions. However, in the productions from 2020, a switch into the discourse about the homeland and coping with pandemic in the far north is visible. In this article, I describe productions from 2020, dividing them into three thematic categories: films about the return to the homeland, films focusing on lockdown isolation and films based on genre conventions (such as comedy or horror), used for creating a discursive approach to pandemic. In the proposed article, I analyse Sámi films from the collection of International Sámi Film Institute, produced in Norway, Sweden or Finland.","[{""name"": ""Agnieszka Kiejziewicz"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123704076 University of Gdańsk""]}]","[""10.1525/aa.2006.108.2.376"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-39116-8_6"", ""10.1515/9780748694181-006"", ""10.1515/9780748694181-004"", ""10.3366/soma.2018.0236"", ""10.1386/sfs_00056_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

This work is a notable departure from the director’s previous output, both in its use of virtual reality and in its focus on the divisive subject of migration. Carne y arena has been praised for its technological innovation, but it has also been criticized for tackling such a political subject through the medium of virtual reality. For some critics, virtual reality is an entirely inappropriate medium for exploring such a serious issue, privileging, in their view, spectacle over reflection. González Iñárritu has countered such critiques by asserting that the use of virtual reality makes the experience of visiting Carne y arena intensely personal and immersive. This article will situate the installation in relation to González Iñárritu’s previous work and examine the debates surrounding the relationship between virtual reality and empathy with reference to Carne y arena.","[{""name"": ""Catherine Leen"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000093319029 Maynooth University""]}]","[""10.1177/233150241700500209"", ""10.2307/1146361"", ""10.1353/dis.2010.a426889"", ""10.1162/PRES_a_00005"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.09.012"", ""10.1080/10509208.2011.585303"", ""10.1386/ncin.7.2.101/1"", ""10.1386/slac_00035_1""]","['Computer Science', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Philosophy', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

I contend that besides the humour, the memes carry insightful commentary on and criticism of society’s reaction to and handling of the pandemic. The memes poke fun at petrified and distressed Malawians, at some politicians who took advantage of the pandemic to further their own interests and how the outbreak widened the gap between the rich and the poor. Some sinophobic memes accused China of infecting the world with virus.

Viola Liuzzo was murdered by KKK members at the end of the Selma-to-Montgomery march that culminated the Selma campaign. Heather Heyer was murdered in a terrorist car attack by a neo-Nazi at the end of the suspended “Unite the Right” rally. Both women were hailed in the press as heroes. Both were misogynistically attacked in white supremacist media—in ways that were almost identical. How can we understand the media representation of white women as racial justice activists and the ways white supremacists understand them in their media platforms? What about the media treatment of African American women activists in Selma and Charlottesville? What's changed, and what hasn't, in fifty years?

Situated in four English regions (North East, North West, South West and Yorkshire and Humber), the focus groups were structured around a process of film elicitation that gathered a set of plural and richly textured responses to the film. Focusing on the participants’ understanding of realism within the film, the article complements existing textual analyses of realism in order to understand better the kinds of interpretive resources that audiences bring to their engagement with films such as I, Daniel Blake. We examine in detail how participants drew on different interpretive resources as a set of personal, emotional and intellectual anchoring points that they used to situate and articulate their readings of the film. These resources ranged from related life experiences and personal memories to emotional responses and political views. In particular, we examine how participants interpreted the film through differing degrees of personal familiarity and empathy with the narrative, characters and places depicted, how the participants dealt with the emotional labours of realism and the feelings evoked through representations of place. Using film elicitation to understand the plurality of interpretations of realism has allowed us to develop a located and multifaceted understanding of the affective dimensions of realist film, and to extend the reach of audience studies to a hitherto under-explored genre.","[{""name"": ""David Forrest"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Merrington"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198742197.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230246973_1"", ""10.1515/9781474413046"", ""10.5040/9780571344086"", ""10.1177/1527476418811118"", ""10.1093/screen/15.2.7"", ""10.1080/02699939308409183"", ""10.1093/screen/18.1.61""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

Mrs Warren undermines Victorian masculinity by subverting the professional ideal undergirding late Victorian society. Mrs Warren challenges the Victorian acceptance of the Protestant notion of work as “duty” and alleges how work is deeply related with economic necessity. Also, Mrs Warren debunks the Victorian acceptance of the Christian notion of body and work and claims how work becomes a practice of self-formation via self-distancing not self-discipline.","[{""name"": ""Jihay Park"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

By approaching these productions through the lens of adaptation theory and, more specifically, via the concept of a re-vision, I will argue that we can better understand the ways in which they mutate the long-standing (though frequently updated) Frankenstein story. As intertexts that interrogate previous cinema and television versions, their focus on female synthetic biologists whose pioneering stem-cell research takes place within a capitalist biomedical framework is particularly innovative. As such, they disrupt the patriarchal paradigm upon which the Frankensteinian filmic tradition has, historically, been established. Most notably, both films celebrate maternality, personal responsibility, and compassion as key values for those who are involved in the biotechnological creation of life.","[{""name"": ""Paul Mitchell"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad Católica de Valencia San Vicente Mártir , Spain""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-78142-6_10"", ""10.7765/9781526108920.00016"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-78142-6_17"", ""10.7765/9781526108920"", ""10.36019/9780813564258"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316091203.015"", ""10.5040/9780755698431"", ""10.5621/sciefictstud.45.2.0289"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-78142-6_9"", ""10.1515/9783110272239.1"", ""10.5040/9798400653582"", ""10.2307/375215""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

When perpetrators of such assaults go unpunished, it fosters a culture of impunity. The article throws searchlight on incidences of assaults on journalists and the ambivalent attitude of the public and/or state agencies towards media freedom. Incidences of assaults and intimidations of journalists in Ghana were reviewed to ignite renewed discourse on the issue, and inform measures on the safety and protection and general development of media. Theoretically, the article is framed along lines of thoughts on concepts of narrative in which there is ‘struggle over narrative’. Major lines of narratives on assaults against journalists are expressed by state functionaries, citizens and the media in competing fashions. Each narrative has ‘competing truth’, which arguably carries for each entity a force of the true and rightful position on the safety of journalists. The article concludes that persistent advocacy by Ghana Journalists Association and media partners can make a difference in influencing positive steps on assaults on journalists.","[{""name"": ""Africanus Lewil Diedong"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404415393 University for Development Studies""]}]","[""10.1177/1541344605276792"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-62057-2_16"", ""10.4314/gjds.v16i2.9"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2016.1199486"", ""10.1386/jams_00017_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Between 1978 and 2018 he worked with virtually all of the most important Catalan actresses and developed a special affinity with some of them, such as Rosa Maria Sardà and Amparo Moreno. The extraordinary interpreting palette of both Sardà and Moreno provided Ventura Pons with a powerful repertoire of acting tones and hues, most notably in comedic genres. This article explores Pons’s construction of national discourses through the roles and performances of Sardà, focusing on the interrelated issues of self-image and national allegory.

Data for the study was gathered from unstructured interviews of artists and non-artists, and observation of live performances.","[{""name"": ""Imomotimi Armstrong"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000417634886 Niger Delta University""]}]","[""10.2478/jef-2021-0004"", ""10.1080/18125980.2012.742234"", ""10.1080/17411910801972909"", ""10.1080/08098131.2015.1088057"", ""10.1525/aa.1991.93.4.02a00050"", ""10.1525/eth.1986.14.4.02a00040"", ""10.1017/S0022278X01003676"", ""10.1177/0255761413515808"", ""10.21504/amj.v9i1.1763"", ""10.1080/18125980903037443"", ""10.1080/18125980701754611"", ""10.1093/afraf/adm057"", ""10.1111/maq.12075"", ""10.2307/3345337""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

On social media in general, and on Facebook in particular, little is known about these narratives. This study addresses the public’s concerns about African narratives on social media by meeting the demand for empirical data on African narratives from an alternative media perspective in Africa. The study follows these debates on Facebook, which are frequently used to raise public awareness and sway public opinion on important issues. The study used thematic content analysis to determine the most prevalent themes covered in the selected posts as well as the sentiments expressed in the comments. To make sense of the data, the study applied critical alternative media theory. The study revealed that topical issues about politics and international affairs, domestic conflict and death, sports and health dominated the media, and sentiments in the comments viewed Africans as a solution to Africa’s problems. Furthermore, the study established that negative stories elicited negative responses, and Africans regarded other African countries as crucial to the continent’s growth. As a result, the study shows that Facebook has evolved into an essential platform for media to share alternative African narratives.","[{""name"": ""Daniel O.

10.1017/S0266464X22000240,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,Unspoken Indigenous History on the Stage: The Postcolonial Plays of Jack Davis,"Literary scholars and linguists have argued extensively that language is not simply a purely representational vehicle of thought but its determining medium, whose ordering powers not only shape cognizance of reality but are also actively involved in processes of imperialism and cultural erasure. It is the determinative yet slippery quality of language, prompting the loss of meaning in attempts at translation, that colonial powers manipulated to violent effect and which, as enacted in the plays of Nyoongah Indigenous Australian playwright Jack Davis, continue to haunt history and the present. This article considers how a history and culture made unspeakable by colonialism through the erasure of Indigenous Australian oral traditions, languages, and historical perspectives is translated on to the Anglophone stage in the plays of Davis, one of the first Indigenous playwrights to be published and performed internationally, and how this was received by the witnessing audience. Davis achieves this theatrical translation not only through the negotiation and manipulation of colonial language and verbatim history alongside Indigenous languages, enacting a kind of linguistic double consciousness, but also through physical theatre and dance. The latter are the central means of communicating meaning and knowledge in Nyoongah culture. Jacqueline M.

This paper aims to rectify this situation by analyzing claims of exceptionality of the successive Orbán governments of Hungary. It aims to shed light on Hungary’s foreign policy by making two core claims. First, based on a diverse range of sources, it shows that successive Hungarian governments have increasingly come to conceptualize Hungary as an exceptional, trail-blazing, model country in foreign policy and beyond, especially after 2018. Secondly, the paper shows how claims of exceptionality can lead to resentment and isolation in foreign policy, if and when they go hand-in-hand with collective narcissism.","[{""name"": ""András Hettyey"", ""affiliation"": [""Andrássy University Budapest, Budapest, Hungary""]}]","[""10.5771/9781793652287"", ""10.1080/10510974.2014.991044"", ""10.5040/9780755626984"", ""10.1080/03637751.2016.1182638"", ""10.3167/9781571816849"", ""10.1002/jts5.69"", ""10.1111/pops.12569"", ""10.1057/s41268-021-00228-w"", ""10.1017/nps.2023.53"", ""10.2478/pce-2023-0024"", ""10.1093/isr/viab052"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1m592f6"", ""10.1177/1354066110377674"", ""10.18414/KSZ.2022.7-8.962"", ""10.4324/9780429053436"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-73144-2"", ""10.1515/9780585123455"", ""10.1057/9781403948175"", ""10.1057/9780333977835"", ""10.2307/2658204"", ""10.1093/isr/viy008"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-69713-6"", ""10.4324/9780203485439"", ""10.1002/9781118093108.ch2"", ""10.18574/nyu/9780814798362.001.0001"", ""10.1080/15387216.2022.2082995"", ""10.4324/9781003462521""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The forests of the late modern era appear as uncanny spaces that express the experience of estrangement typical of late modernity.

The goal was to reduce this disparity by studying turnout in the 21st century under a statistically atypical approach that uses objective, publicly available data at the municipalities/cities level. Beginning in 2012, the trend of a worrying, almost linear decrease in turnout was found. Canonical correlation analysis showed that socio-demographic-economic variables are highly predictive of voter turnout.

10.1017/S0266464X21000166,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Trying Again, Failing Again: Samuel Beckett and the Sequel Play","Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot has spawned several unauthorized sequel plays, which see Godot arrive on stage in 1960s Yugoslavia, 1980s Ireland, 1990s North America, and early 2000s Japan. The sequel play is a largely ignored phenomenon in literary scholarship, with the sequel form itself routinely dismissed as a derivative and inevitably disappointing text. Yet the sequel also re-situates and re-evaluates the original text, and its reiterative nature aptly parallels the paradox of non-ending in Beckett’s original Waiting for Godot. Focusing on four unauthorized stage sequels to Beckett’s play – Miodrag Bulatović’s Godo je došao (Godot Has Arrived, 1966), Alan Titley’s Tagann Godot (Godot Arrives, 1987), Daniel Curzon’s Godot Arrives (1999), and Minoru Betsuyaku’s Yattekita Godot (Godot Has Come, 2007) – this article examines how these sequels rework the cultural logic of Godot’s arrival to their own critical and political ends. These playwrights draw on the very recursive, even frustrating, nature of the sequel form itself as an exegetic framework, reproducing the trope of non-ending that characterizes Beckett’s own work. Hannah Simpson is the Rosemary Pountney Junior Research Fellow in British and European Drama at St Anne’s College, University of Oxford. She is currently working on two forthcoming Beckett-related monographs: Witnessing Pain: Samuel Beckett and Post-War Francophone Theatre and Samuel Beckett and Disability Performance.","[{""name"": ""Hannah Simpson"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

10.3366/film.2021.0155,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,Trembling Meaning: Camera Instability and Gilbert Simondon's Transduction in Czech Archival Film,"Many experimental found footage films base their meanings and effects on an interaction between the figurative content of the image and its material-technological underpinnings. Can this interaction arise accidentally without artistic appropriation? A recently digitised film by the Czech cinema pioneer Jan Kříženecký, Opening Ceremony of the Čech Bridge (1908), presents such an exercise in accidental aesthetics. At one point, the horizontal and vertical trembling of the cinematograph – obtained from the Lumière brothers – translates into a trembling of the figures on the bridge so precisely that the figurative and material spheres appear to cooperate towards a common aesthetic goal. To account for such phenomena, film theory, found footage filmmaking, and archival practice need to join forces with philosophy. More specifically, Gilbert Simondon's notion of transduction, a process based on the intersection of diverse realities within a domain, allows us to conceptualise the paradoxical interaction between the figurative and material dimensions and the unintentional meanings that arise out of it. Transduction enables the distribution of elements between these heterogeneous spheres while maintaining a certain stability within a system. In the case of archival films in which transduction occurs without prior intention or expectation, transduction can be foregrounded and prolonged. The connection between transduction and the “trembling meaning” of Opening Ceremony, understood within the wider context of camera instability in experimental found footage, will uncover the aesthetic potentialities held by the autonomous creativity of film matter and its interferences with the figurative content.","[{""name"": ""Jiří Anger"", ""affiliation"": [""Charles University, Prague""]}]","[""10.5840/philtoday2017918167"", ""10.58193/ilu.1621"", ""10.21476/PP.2017.33140"", ""10.5040/9780755603435"", ""10.5040/9780755603435.ch-005"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-23099-0"", ""10.5040/9780755603435.ch-006"", ""10.5040/9781350251991"", ""10.14361/transcript.9783839428177"", ""10.5749/j.ctvc5pcbz"", ""10.1515/9789048529094-006"", ""10.5040/9781350116139.0005"", ""10.58193/ilu.1609"", ""10.4159/9780674042834"", ""10.1215/9780822372004"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190949709.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781838710125"", ""10.5040/9781911239123""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['History', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

It is less well known, however, that, on one occasion, Shaw and Trebitsch switched roles: Shaw became a translator and translated a play written by Siegfried Trebitsch. Shaw’s main inspiration and motivation for this was that he wanted to help his translator out, as Trebitsch found himself in financial difficulties at the time. In his Translator’s Note, Shaw admits to “translator’s treacheries,” to changing the “key in which [the play] ends,” and he explains in some detail what he has done and why, but only a careful comparison of original and translation reveals the extent of what he really means.","[{""name"": ""Sibylle Ferner"", ""affiliation"": [""Professional Translator""]}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

As a result, it is observed that these characteristics in Sufism correspond to the traits that form digital love. In other words, digital love is an emotional state in which someone or something is idealized without being seen in person just like the concept of love in Sufism. The digital age has transformed spiritual values despite the fact that the quest for emotional attachment has been constant since the beginning of human existence.","[{""name"": ""Aybike Serttaş"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

This recent development is undoubtedly due to the rise of social media and the increasing accessibility of video technologies, but also to the need for theatre companies to publicize their work in a media that combines creative autonomy with economic efficiency. Despite this widespread use, trailers in the performing arts have received little attention in academic literature. This article offers the first, exploratory study on the use of promotional videos in the field of contemporary theatre in Italy and on the connections between the current creation of digital promotional clips and the heritage of the Italian video-theatre. Through in-depth interviews with sixteen of the leading Italian companies, this research aims to bring out the role theatre trailers play for performance artists.","[{""name"": ""Stefano Brilli"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123697670 Università degli Studi di Urbino Carlo Bo""]}, {""name"": ""Laura Gemini"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123697670 Università degli Studi di Urbino Carlo Bo""]}]","[""10.1080/14794713.2020.1773698"", ""10.1007/s41244-017-0074-2"", ""10.1177/1354856507087946"", ""10.1002/nvsm.392"", ""10.1386/jicms_00103_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Wilhelmina Stirling in 1904 published a novel, Toy Gods, virtually unknown today, which has plot elements similar to those of Pygmalion. As she and her family, which included Pre-Raphaelite artists and writers, were themselves in society and experienced its constraints, her observations are particularly relevant. Her novel illuminates the social and feminist concerns so important to Shaw, in particular those expressed by Eliza when she told Higgins, “I only want to be natural.” Written by Mary De Morgan (Stirling's sister Evelyn's sister-in-law), the fairy tale “A Toy Princess” further expresses these concerns. The romanticization of Shaw's play is discussed in the context of these issues.","[{""name"": ""Jesse M.

More precisely, I analyse how the public funding of films for children and youth in Denmark has undergone significant change in response to intensified competition and waning audience interest. From the outset of the Commissioner’s Scheme for films for children and youth at the Danish Film Institute (DFI), the state subsidized main financier in the national industry, the institution has changed away from selective funding based on cultural evaluation criteria towards audience-centric funding based on market orientation and data-driven audience insights. The DFI’s objective is to reach young audiences more precisely with films that are relevant to them. Yet, one of the implications so far of this practice has been that funds earmarked by law for films for children and youth are spent on films for adults, with significant ramifications for domestic film culture for young audiences.","[{""name"": ""Jakob Freudendal"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000119562722 Aarhus University""]}]","[""10.1386/jsca_00097_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Urban Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

However, there are still methodologies with which adaptation studies has not yet engaged in detail, and which could be enriched by certain existing adaptation studies conventions. One such approach is ecocriticism: analyses of how various cultural practices reflect and inform human attitudes and behaviours towards the non human world around us. This article outlines how the study of adaptation has thus far engaged with ecocritical issues, and indicates how existing adaptation studies protocols offer useful tools to extend the ecocritical project in a diachronic and intercultural manner.","[{""name"": ""Robert Geal"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Film Studies, University of Wolverhampton , UK""]}]","[""10.1353/nlh.2007.0038"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-11153-1"", ""10.4324/9781315144689"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511610394"", ""10.1093/isle/15.2.1"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apaa015""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Gender Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

Contrary to this tendency, in illustrating the relationship between heresy and affect in Saint Joan (1923), Bernard Shaw provides the template for a progressive ethics of shamelessness. While he is often considered a creator of puppets that merely voice his ideas, this article argues that his characters contend with complex emotions and that he is attuned to the ways in which affect governs human relationships and political institutions. Through Joan’s refusal to be ashamed of her heresies – her proto-Protestantism, her proto-feminism, and her proto-nationalism – Shaw makes a compelling case for shamelessness as having the potential to impel society toward positive evolutionary change.","[{""name"": ""Brad Kent"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/9780822393047-001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804618"", ""10.1037/10001-000"", ""10.3998/mpub.9690777"", ""10.1080/09589236.2013.783461"", ""10.5744/florida/9780813042435.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11316pw.4"", ""10.1057/9780230583184"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107477933"", ""10.1080/05568641.2010.538916"", ""10.2307/j.ctt21c4t82"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511612411"", ""10.1017/S0047279412000979"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-71513-1"", ""10.1353/cdr.1985.0017"", ""10.5325/shaw.36.1.0053""]","['Psychology', 'Medicine']","['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

In December 1957, the two countries signed their first co-production agreements, designed to foster reciprocal industrial and artistic cooperation. Although only two official co-productions were made, until the late 1960s, the two film industries cooperated on the making of about 40 films, during which time Yugoslav companies were denied artistic control and downgraded to a labour and locations supplier. By examining archival sources, we demonstrate that Italian state bureaucracy had a pivotal role in making film co-production an organizational field where subjects and institutions interact, regulate power relations and communicate. This allows us to highlight the role of co-production as a form of management of international relations, focusing on issues such as the lack of balance between partners and the financial rationale behind these arrangements.","[{""name"": ""Francesco Di Chiara"", ""affiliation"": [""University eCampus in Novedrate""]}, {""name"": ""Paolo Noto"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000417571758 University of Bologna""]}]","[""10.1353/frm.2006.0001"", ""10.1017/eso.2014.24"", ""10.2307/2095101"", ""10.1386/jicms_00082_1"", ""10.1177/0022526617702158"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-97157-5_4"", ""10.1080/13662710701524072"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12830"", ""10.1080/17400300701850590"", ""10.1080/1354571X.2014.962261"", ""10.1162/JCWS_a_00174"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2021.0564""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Why did anti-genderism develop and become pronounced in otherwise different post-communist countries? This article traces the origins of these movements based on news coverage and scholarly sources, arguing that anti-gender movements signal authoritarian trends and thus matter deeply for open, democratic societies.

10.3138/ctr.184.006,CANADIAN THEATRE REVIEW,1303 Drama Film and Television,"This Is What It Sounds Like: Intimate Karaoke, Live at Uterine Concert Hall","This article explores the role of sound in Intimate Karaoke, Live at Uterine Concert Hall, an interactive durational performance that features Dayna McLeod’s body as a concert venue. Here, practice-based methods that were used to generate knowledge through hands-on investigation and performance are detailed, as are experimentations with different presentations of her body and sound. This article discusses the relationship between this performance piece and failure, queerness, middle-ageing, and non-reproduction against a cultural backdrop that reveres art star success, youth, heterosexuality, and childbearing. In creating Intimate Karaoke, Live at Uterine Concert Hall, the artist was interested in proposing her uterus as a queer performance site in order to draw attention to these cultural biases while assigning a new kind of value to her middle-ageing, queer, female body. Sound is central to the formal circuitry of the piece as it shapes the representational status of her body and enables the performance to function. Intimate Karaoke is the umbrella term for both the formal construction of the performance and the affective methods of engagement that were employed in the creation of the work, which both rely on and challenge notions of vulnerability, intimacy, and familiarity. This article examines how the design of the performance focused the audience’s attention on the often heteronormative and reproductive expectations aimed at women’s bodies while questioning why we feel entitled to make demands on these bodies in the first place.","[{""name"": ""Dayna McLeod"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9780230119550""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Music']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"
10.1386/smt_00018_1,STUDIES IN MUSICAL THEATRE,1303 Drama Film and Television,Thievery or giving back? The challenges and potentials of using theatre to disseminate ethnomusicological research,"In 2004, ethnomusicologist Anne Lederman premieredSpirit of the Narrows, an ethnodrama based on her research in Ojibwe and Métis communities in Manitoba, Canada. Told from the point of view of the researcher, the play – mixing narrative with live fiddling – provides a compelling glimpse into the music tradition of these communities. It is also a fascinating example of ethnomusicological research translated for a non-academic audience. UsingSpirit of the Narrowsas a case study, this essay considers the challenges and potentials of bringing ethnodrama to ethnomusicology, or alternatively, ethnomusicology to ethnodrama. I argue that, if done with an eye to ethical relationships, ethnodrama can provide a dynamic means of disseminating music research. More importantly, it can engage communities in research and dissemination, in a sense, giving back that which was taken through research.","[{""name"": ""Monique Giroux"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000094710214 University of Lethbridge""]}]","[""10.1080/14452294.2011.11649529"", ""10.1080/10462938509391578"", ""10.51644/9781771121705-003"", ""10.5406/americanmusic.36.4.0412"", ""10.1177/107780049800400305"", ""10.1080/08929092.2012.678227"", ""10.1162/105420402320351468"", ""10.4135/9781412976145.n23"", ""10.51644/9781771121705-004"", ""10.51644/9781771121705-009"", ""10.51644/9781771121705-002"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195324952.003.0005"", ""10.1386/smt_00018_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Formerly a part of the Ottoman Empire, the city was annexed by the modern Greek state during the first Balkan War in the fall of 1912. Moving beyond methodological nationalism, the study delves into the networks of cinema distribution, strategies of exhibition, and cinemagoing activities in the city of Thessaloniki before and after 1912. The aim is to contribute to the discourse on the transnational cinema history of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. Furthermore, by examining Thessaloniki’s interwoven history, this research seeks to enrich our understanding of cinematographic centers and peripheries around 1910. It also strives to provide insights into the discordant chronologies of the dissemination and establishment of cinema by considering a diversity of regional factors across borders.","[{""name"": ""Mélisande Leventopoulos"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

When the first positive case of COVID-19 was reported in March 2020, the Zimbabwe government, like many other countries, responded by introducing restrictions for public gatherings and ultimately a lockdown including arts events. Yet, theatricality has refused to capitulate. Artists re-invented their theatre productions into theatrical comic and satirical works posted on various social media platforms, in an effort to make sense of the pandemic, bring laughter and address a serious complex situation. We examine how artists deployed theatre to journal, capture and document the citizen’s collective experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, for both the present and posterity. We are specifically interested in analysing the different ways art is deployed to provide entertainment, a broader understanding and awareness of the social, psychological and economic impact of COVID-19 for the present and future generations.","[{""name"": ""Nkululeko Sibanda"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121072298 University of Pretoria""]}, {""name"": ""Cletus Moyo"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000406484683 Lupane State University""]}]","[""10.11648/j.ajtas.20160501.11"", ""10.1080/14616700601056858"", ""10.1386/jams.9.3.507_1"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2017.1358652"", ""10.1080/02500167.2019.1626457"", ""10.24193/mjcst.2020.9.06"", ""10.1080/18125980.2016.1182383"", ""10.1386/jams_00079_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Equally, it looks to offer an alternative and expanded theory of theatricality in which the theatrical is no longer associated with theatre per se. On the contrary, it is now seen as a mode of representation that deterritorializes spectators by placing them in the midst of groundless flows and anonymous processes. In the same way that the earth in the Anthropocene is figured as a dynamic and unstable planet, so drifting and theatricality, when brought together, radicalise our extant understandings of the stage by allowing it to become motile, a terrestrial force. Here, the ecological potential of theatre is not found in staging plays about climate change or insisting on site-specificity, but in thinking through the geological power of theatricality, its capacity to exist as a type of plate tectonics. Such an expanded understanding of theatricality explains why instead of paying attention to a specific theatre production or even to the medium of theatre in a restricted sense, I examine how, in their 1958 text and image collaboration Mémoires, the Danish artist Asger Jorn and his friend Guy Debord were able to transform the page into a stage – to theatricalize and geologize reading. In an attempt, simultaneously, to expand and undo itself, the article is not content to conceptualize its argument, it looks to theatricalize itself, to become a kind of drift, a geology of writing.","[{""name"": ""Carl Lavery"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

Founder and artistic director Jonathan Shailor provides an exploration of the theory and practice that informs his work, which he calls the Theatre of Empowerment: storytelling, dialogue and performance, in the service of personal and social evolution. The key to understanding this work is seeing the prison theatre ensemble as a ‘community of practice’ that cultivates the virtues of individual empowerment, relational responsibility and moral imagination. The author tests these claims with a preliminary analysis of participants’ stories and draws conclusions from this analysis that will inform the next chapter of ‘The Shakespeare Prison Project’: Shakespeare’s Mirror, an approach that connects themes from Shakespeare’s plays with the personal narratives of incarcerated actors.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan Shailor"", ""affiliation"": [""0000000110105728University of Wisconsin - Parkside""]}]","[""10.1386/dtr_00002_1"", ""10.3390/h8030123"", ""10.1037/aca0000257"", ""10.1080/13569783.2021.1950527"", ""10.1386/dtr_00092_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Conservation', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Bach draws on Buddhist concepts to retrain the senses and unlearn perceptions, inviting audience–participants to reflect on the forms and concepts that define Hong Kong. 2 or 3 Things revises a section of the kunqu opera Peony Pavilion to revisit the protests and offer an explicit statement on censorship. Both productions provide a space for experimentation and reflection within a city that has seemingly foreclosed on practices of questioning, exploring and gathering.

Two introductory sequences from the British programme Most Haunted () are analysed that investigate ‘ordinary homes’ to consider the way that place is framed. Using textual analysis, the content of these sequences, including visual, auditory and discursive signifiers, is considered to identify themes where the inversion of the ordinary and the de-stabilizing of homeliness emerged. The use of binary oppositions and representations of liminality are identified as frequent tropes in the production of reality paranormal television. It is argued that these elements frame places as potentially uncanny and invite the viewers to participate in the paranormal possibility of the home. The uncanny, it is concluded, forms an integral part of the narratives that construct reality paranormal programmes and their success at sustaining an engaged and exploratory audience.","[{""name"": ""Fiona Smith"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123241681 Robert Gordon University""]}, {""name"": ""Rachael Ironside"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123241681 Robert Gordon University""]}]","[""10.1111/jpcu.12852"", ""10.1177/1461445615611784"", ""10.1093/musqtl/gdi002"", ""10.1386/jptv.6.1.105_1"", ""10.1080/00155870701337403"", ""10.1386/host.4.2.173_1"", ""10.1386/jptv_00072_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

10.1386/jac_00038_1,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN CINEMAS,1303 Drama Film and Television,The role of place and identity as core contributing success factors in Jayan Moodley's Keeping up with the Kandasamys and Kandasamys: The Wedding,"Keeping up with the Kandasamys(), a family comedy co-written and directed by Jayan Moodley, was the first cinematic feature to be set in the post-apartheid Indian township of Chatsworth, Durban and generated R16.3 million at the box office. The film delves into the matriarchal rivalry of neighbouring families while showcasing the unique Chatsworth subculture. This box office success prompted the release of the sequelKandasamys: The Wedding(), which broke its own sales record, earning R18.9 million. As filmmakers who were intimately involved in the production of the sequel, and who engaged with viewers and community members, we provide a critical analysis, reflecting on why the films attracted large audiences and galvanized an outburst of fandom. This article postulates that Indian South African audiences identified with the authentic portrayal of the nuances of every-day life in Chatsworth, resulting in feelings of visibility and nostalgia. In attempting to explain the phenomenal support from these audiences, the authors examine theories of place identity and literature on Indian South African identity, inferring that the intersection of place, and the representation of Indian South Africans in the features, is significant to the films’ success.","[{""name"": ""Sogen Moodley"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000093609165 Durban University of Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Arushani Govender"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419371135 University of the Witwatersrand""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jenvp.2014.10.007"", ""10.1386/ncin.14.1.93_1"", ""10.1348/014466600164318"", ""10.1353/trn.2017.0003"", ""10.2979/reseafrilite.42.3.1"", ""10.1163/9789004288065_010"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00001.x"", ""10.1006/jevp.2001.0226"", ""10.1177/1077800414542707"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2010.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.progress.2013.05.003"", ""10.1111/j.0435-3684.2004.00150.x"", ""10.1386/jac.8.2.133_1"", ""10.1016/S0272-4944(02)00079-8"", ""10.1080/09502360903361709"", ""10.1093/forestscience/49.6.830""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

But ‘responsibility to protect’ is a slippery ethical notion that can easily fall into interventionism, the latter linked with forms of terrorism. Thus, it is not by chance that TV shows and films revolving around important, powerful CEO decisions impacting upon the entire world have flourished like never before since September 11. One of the most important shows about global responsibility and shadowy conspiracies has been The Honourable Woman (2014), which revolves about a woman and a company trying their best to ensure global betterment. However, as a British miniseries, it cannot escape the implicit topic of intervention. The conspiracy here illustrates current fears about global interventionism and the state responsibility to protect: the possibility of the latter as a mere excuse for personal gain. Behind the façade of ‘responsibility to protect’ lies the possibility of a global conspiracy to only want to augment capitalist power.","[{""name"": ""Fernando Gabriel Pagnoni Berns"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000100561981 Universidad de Buenos Aires""]}, {""name"": ""Patricia Vazquez"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000100561981 Universidad de Buenos Aires""]}]","[""10.1057/9781403938466_1"", ""10.1215/9780822384854-007""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It felt like it was possible to plan new intellectual journeys together and I asked Lily whether she might be interested to take part in a panel on the ‘yogurt roads’ of Eurasia for the 2019 EISA conference in Sofia (Bulgaria). Her response was prompt and positive. Knowing that I come from the country, Lily also used the opportunity provided by this exchange to ask me whether there is something personal about my interest in the topic of relationality. Unfortunately, in the following week or so, work and family commitments prevented me from writing back. At the same time, Lily’s brief question appeared to have stirred something that kept her question constantly at the back of my mind and finding it difficult to come up with a meaningful answer. In the end, even though I had no clear idea what I am going to say, I turned on my computer with the firm decision to respond to her message before doing anything else that day. Yet, the first email in my inbox bore the shocking and unbelievable news of Lily’s sudden passing.

The research is framed by exploratory practice, a methodology that considers ‘practice-as-research’ and ‘understanding-for-practice’ in second language education. An investigation of the meaning(s) of the term ‘practice’ was imperative as a semantic gap existed between the use of the term ‘practice’ in exploratory practice (the research methodology underpinning the study) and the concept of ‘practice’ in performative language pedagogy (the teaching approach used in the study).

As a result, the pandemic dominated global and national news headlines for an extended period of time. Science and health journalists, and their colleagues covering other journalistic beats, were called upon to report on various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and many journalists found themselves in unchartered waters. To investigate the effects of the pandemic on journalists in South Africa, we adopted a qualitative approach and conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with twenty science, health and environmental journalists. We explored the challenges and demands that they faced, as well as how the pandemic changed science journalism in South Africa. This study highlights journalists’ capacity-building needs as identified during the pandemic and suggests ways to strengthen science journalism in the country.","[{""name"": ""Marina Joubert"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012214904X Stellenbosch University""]}, {""name"": ""Lali van Zuydam"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012214904X Stellenbosch University""]}, {""name"": ""Suzanne Franks"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368497 City, University of London""]}]","[""10.1177/09636625221089391"", ""10.1177/0963662514547478"", ""10.1386/jams_00050_2"", ""10.1080/02500167.2011.622288"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican0322-38"", ""10.1038/s41591-020-01207-3"", ""10.1177/0309133312471285"", ""10.1386/jams_00039_2"", ""10.1177/0963662519875447"", ""10.1177/0002764221992813"", ""10.1007/s11616-020-00594-4"", ""10.1386/jams_00052_1"", ""10.1386/jams_00040_1"", ""10.1386/jams_00095_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The female main characters in the Senegalese Madame Brouette (2002), by Moussa Sène Absa, the Burkinabe Frontières (Borders) (2017), by Apolline Traoré, and the Nigerian The Ghost and the House of Truth (2019), by Akin Omotoso, all face economic and gender subalternization and end up being involved in violence in order to confront it. So as to use an appropriate methodology, we first argue that African film is multilingual, as much linguistically as in terms of cinematic grammar. In order to understand how the female characters navigate their subalternized roles in narratives that look at their subjugation, we then analyse each film regarding the ways how they try, mostly unsuccessfully, to affirm their subjectivity and which multilingual cinematographic grammars are used for this.","[{""name"": ""Carolin Overhoff Ferreira"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000105147202 Universidade Federal de São Paulo""]}, {""name"": ""José Lingna Nafafe"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419367603 University of Bristol""]}]","[""10.1080/02533952.2016.1164955"", ""10.3406/comm.1964.1028"", ""10.4000/eces.1533"", ""10.1080/13688790500375132""]",['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Media coverage, public events and self-representation are discussed to outline how official and unofficial narratives are constructed, mobilised and performed. Focusing on London, it presents a critical cultural discussion of transfers and translations between central and local government officers, property investors and estate agents, and third-sector ‘meanwhile space’ intermediaries. Temporary urbanism at times of post-crisis austerity is confirmed as an ambiguous urban cultural discourse that raises the promise of practices of dissent and vacant space re-appropriation, such as community-oriented radical practices and squatting, while practically foreclosing them.","[{""name"": ""Mara Ferreri"", ""affiliation"": [""Northumbria University""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

('The head of Ghlai?'),"Parts 1 and 2 of the Arab Jordanian series Rās Ghlaiṣ (‘The head of Ghlaiṣ’) (2006–08), written by Jordanian screenwriter Muṣṭafā Ṣāliḥ and directed by Aḥmad D‘aibis and Sha‘lān al-Dabbās, share three ‘common denominators’, in Haun Saussy’s terminology, with Christopher Marlowe’s Tamburlaine the Great, Parts 1 and 2 (1587): (1) the shepherd character as a monstrous despot, (2) pastoral love of the shepherds and (3) the mobilization of nations/tribes to take revenge against Tamburlaine/Ghlaiṣ. Ṣāliḥ’s delineation of the nomadic hero Ghlaiṣ is similar to the Marlovian model of Tamburlaine in a time of war and love. Ghlaiṣ, as an Arab Jordanian Tamburlaine, seeks in a Machiavellian manner an ultimate rule and control over all nomadic tribes in the Jordanian desert and behaves as a monstrous lover. This article takes two pieces of literature from two different cultures as an example of the adaptability of screen narrative to the scope of comparative literature and appropriation studies, showing simultaneously the experience of Jordanian screenwriters as one example of what Craig Batty calls the ‘screenwriting turn’ (2014: 1). Both Marlowe and Ṣāliḥ dramatize the shepherd despots to warn against the threat of colonial and imperial ambitions and models.","[{""name"": ""Hussein A.

Veiled to preserve his anonymity, he delivers his 80-minute monologue within the confines of a motel room. Though the ‘talking head’ is a well-worn device associated with televisual documentary, Rosi’s film, shot on digital, might be said to be anchored in a cinematic documentary tradition by recourse to another medium: drawing. As the sicario talks, he sketches cartel activities ranging from drug transportation to brutal physical violence on the pages of a notepad. This article considers how Rosi’s filming of drawing in El Sicario reveals something significant of drawing in film, in documentary and in this director’s documentary films in particular. Informed by Jacques Derrida’s reflections on drawing and by the ethical thought of Emmanuel Levinas, I suggest that the drawing of El Sicario illuminates concerns fundamental to documentary film – of sight and its occlusion, of scepticism and faith, evidence and education.","[{""name"": ""Rhiannon Harries"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368868 University of Nottingham""]}]","[""10.1093/oxartj/kcu007"", ""10.1215/10407391-2006-020"", ""10.1215/10407391-2006-025"", ""10.1163/156916494X00131"", ""10.1386/jicms_00138_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"
10.1386/smt_00032_1,STUDIES IN MUSICAL THEATRE,1303 Drama Film and Television,The dithyrambic dramatist: A Nietzschean musical-performative conception,"The concept of the dithyrambic dramatist – introduced by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in the fourth essay of his Untimely Meditations of 1873–76 – is one of the most performance-oriented concepts to emerge out of the nineteenth century in which theatre was often associated with dramatic literature. This article investigates the nature of the dithyrambic dramatist by tracing, in the first instance, the underlying musical perspectives – already evident in The Birth of Tragedy of 1872 – which led Nietzsche to develop the concept. In the second instance, the author articulates what may be considered as its key conditions, namely the visible–audible and individual–collective relationalities. In view of the arguments brought forward, the concept of the dithyrambic dramatist is located as an interdisciplinary element that emerged out of an art form – music – to which Nietzsche was intimately associated in his youth as a composer. The author further proposes that, rather than a metaphor to philological tropes, the dithyrambic dramatist is a concrete manifestation of interdisciplinary and performative foundations that inform Nietzsche’s analytic perspectives.","[{""name"": ""Mario Frendo"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121769482 University of Malta""]}]","[""10.1386/smt.7.2.207_1"", ""10.1017/S0266464X18000581"", ""10.1177/0090591785013002002"", ""10.1386/smt_00032_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Philosophy', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

10.1386/josc_00069_1,JOURNAL OF SCREENWRITING,1303 Drama Film and Television,The deliberated decision in children's mainstream cinema: On socialization in the discourse of freedom,"The purpose of this article is to highlight a trend in the narrative use of decisions that reinforces a widely accepted discourse of freedom. Through a discursive analysis focusing on contemporary mainstream screenwriting, it explores the relationship between the protagonist’s decision and the climax of the story. This relationship is shaped by the need for a change between the darkest moment and the climax, and causality between the events and the conflict that triggers them. The decision is a standardized possibility compatible with these principles, reproducing a discourse of freedom upheld by numerous social institutions despite the problems and dysfunctions pointed out by its critics. This freedom is underpinned by the notion of individual authenticity, which promises that anything can be achieved as long as nothing hinders the individual or his/her power to make decisions. Specifically, the article highlights a channel through which this discourse influences the sector of the public that is most sensitive to socialization processes: children and youth. With the normalized practice of screenwriting and without necessarily being aware of the fact, screenwriters can reproduce this discourse of freedom and thereby take part in reinforcing its social legitimacy.","[{""name"": ""Marc Plana"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122960625 ISNI: 0000000120970205 ERAM College and Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona""]}]","[""10.1386/josc_00069_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

10.1386/ac_00035_1,ASIAN CINEMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,The critique of anti - communist state violence in Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives,"Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s Palme d’Or-awarded Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (2010) has ostensibly been embraced by both critics and scholars alike as international art cinema and for being constitutive of a canon of world cinema from the vantage of Southeast Asia. This article, however, takes a detour to focus particularly on the film’s engagement with Thai politics and its complex intertwinement with Buddhism during the period of anti-communism. I specifically look at how the film replicates religious beliefs and indigenous practices, such as the structure of kamma and reincarnation as redemption, that were used by the right-wing military government to justify a series of anti-communist pogroms. I argue that by hijacking such religious narratives and translating them into cinematic form, the film manages to eschew the risk of being suppressed by censorship, or, at worst, of reproducing the state-imposed narrative on the appropriation and accomplishment of such violence in the name of the nation. This article aims to shed light on how the film criticizes not only the past – what historically happened – but also the way we come to understand the history of such atrocious event and relate to it as our national history.","[{""name"": ""Palita Chunsaengchan"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368657 University of Minnesota""]}]","[""10.1353/mos.2015.0046"", ""10.1525/FQ.2011.64.4.48"", ""10.1386/ac_00035_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The Russian response saw significant aggression, but also seemingly involving inaction or even restraint in other areas. The question is what are some plausible explanations for this contradictory behaviour. In order to answer this question, relevant terminology is defined, then the subnational level is focused on and Most Similar System Design is utilised. Then cases involving significant aggression are considered, before moving on to those seemingly involving inaction or even restraint. Finally, these two elements are reconciled, producing a clear picture of the overall similarities, the inconsistencies and the crucial differences. The article finds the crucial differences to be the level of loyalty to the Kremlin and willingness to engage in collaboration or cooperation. The focus on loyalty to the Kremlin and the issue of willingness to collaborate is revealing.","[{""name"": ""Judas Everett"", ""affiliation"": [""National Research University Higher School of Economics, Russian Federation, Wrocław, Poland""]}]","[""10.1093/ia/iix061"", ""10.1080/13645570701401552"", ""10.1177/0022002705282872"", ""10.30965/24518921-00601004"", ""10.1177/0022002702046003005"", ""10.5040/9780755640027"", ""10.1080/14702430902921452"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198706861.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108678384.001"", ""10.1080/13597566.2021.1941900"", ""10.1093/hepl/9780198820628.001.0001"", ""10.15388/Polit.2019.96.4"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00115"", ""10.2307/2148197"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818462"", ""10.2307/20044284"", ""10.1080/09668136.2017.1397603"", ""10.1007/s12116-013-9130-2"", ""10.1057/9780333984215"", ""10.1080/23745118.2022.2074398"", ""10.2307/20045622"", ""10.1080/09668136.2021.1912297"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2016.1146452"", ""10.1080/00263206.2020.1775590"", ""10.1080/23745118.2016.1154229"", ""10.1080/10417940309373268"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-3212-8_2"", ""10.1163/9789004353510"", ""10.1007/BF02687586"", ""10.1017/9781108678384.003"", ""10.1017/9781108644082"", ""10.5604/18984509.1184216"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190253301.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0022343300037006002"", ""10.2753/PPC1075-8216550204"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000111"", ""10.1093/fpa/orz006""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

As a South African filmmaker of mixed heritage (classified as ‘coloured’ under the Apartheid-era code), I recall a childhood of cinema, of cinematic moments, of screen heroes and of sociocultural traditions (imported, imposed and Indigenous) that shaped our ideas and expressions of masculinity as boys and men. Constant in this reflection is how spatial Apartheid (as effected through the Group Areas Act of 1950) impacted Black life in all its manifestations, but particularly the ways it determined how we lived and engaged with cinema in these designated and tightly controlled spaces. The fact that we could find resonance with films narratives, by interpreting them into our own lingo and bribing the screen icons into our realities gave us a window to reimagine our reality.","[{""name"": ""Errol Teddy Mattera"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419371135 University of the Witwatersrand""]}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

At their best, these moments have created a performance from the patient’s story that has become shared. Moments of animation in the hospice are meetings between me and a person who is in palliative care. I have facilitated our meeting and brought a suitcase full of everyday objects with me. A patient is given a story and then cast in their own story with objects they have chosen. Meetings with patients in palliative care made me think about patients moral agency. A moral agent is a being who consciously puts moral activities into practice. Expressive objects telling stories for a patient is one place where moral agency survives in the hospice setting and where a palliative care patient can act for a while as a member of a moral community.

During the postwar years, it also went by the name Théâtre de la République after 1947 and Théâtre du Nouveau-Lancry after 1951, but many still referred to it simply as “Lancry.”","[{""name"": ""Nick Underwood"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3898/175864316815923498"", ""10.2979/JSS.2002.9.1.95"", ""10.1215/9780822385189"", ""10.2307/j.ctv13qftsq"", ""10.3917/aj.451.0027"", ""10.4159/9780674495890"", ""10.1177/0022009405051552"", ""10.3917/aj.481.0136"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199764556.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0364009408000160"", ""10.7591/9781501731877"", ""10.1353/jqr.0.0012"", ""10.1093/oso/9780192801319.001.0001"", ""10.3917/arco.hobs.2013.01"", ""10.36019/9780813552255"", ""10.3998/mpub.9533320"", ""10.2307/j.ctvhn0914"", ""10.1525/9780520919297"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479835041.003.0002"", ""10.4159/9780674496132""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Archeology', 'History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Film-makers’ interest in the period at that time coincided with the cultural, social and political turmoil of 1968 as well as with the increasingly popularised revision of the period in Marxist historiography, such as Christopher Hill’s seminal book The World Turned Upside Down. Recently, there has been a renewed interest of British film-makers in Hill’s focus on the subcultures of the English Revolution, such as the Diggers, as well as in the aesthetics of earlier films about the period. This article analyses two contemporary films about the period, Ben Wheatley’s A Field in England and Thomas Clay’s Fanny Lye Deliver’d, and through historicisation and contextualisation within film, genre and media history seeks to understand the significance of their return to the historical material of the seventeenth century as well as to the style of their filmic models from the 1960s and 1970s. The article argues that the two films perform an ‘archaeology of the future’ (Jameson) that excavates utopian ‘futures past’ (Koselleck) in British cultural history as well as in British film and media history. By analysing Wheatley and Clay’s films as hauntological and archaeological texts, the article explores the potential of the cinematic image for engaging with national and film history as well as with visions of the past and the future.","[{""name"": ""Mark Schmitt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/jj.14491669"", ""10.4324/9781003004400-1"", ""10.1111/criq.12259"", ""10.1111/criq.12260"", ""10.4324/9781315201580""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The gesture was an assertion of ethnic Albanian pre-eminence in Kosovo and a rhetorical strike against the Serbians, who still claim ownership over Kosovo even ten years after its declaration of independence. The gesture sparked worldwide media coverage and prompted punishments by FIFA (the World Cup's governing body), which legislates against overt political expression during matches. In this article, I will examine the double-headed eagle gesture as an example of the body's unique capacity to perform multiple political interventions at once. Not only did it transmit a contentious history, it also undermined the anti-political boundaries erected around the scenarios of transnational combat engendered by FIFA, highlighted anti-immigrant sentiments still festering across Europe, and illustrated the communicative powers that elite players can access through their goal celebrations. Considering these valences supports my reading of this case as symbolic of the sort of ruptures produced by competing impulses operating in Europe today, one working for the affirmation of the union, the other for its dissolution.","[{""name"": ""JARED STRANGE"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/wentk/9780195376739.001.0001"", ""10.1162/DRAM_a_00521"", ""10.3138/9781442682214"", ""10.5040/9781350989146"", ""10.4159/9780674054387"", ""10.1353/tj.2018.0056"", ""10.4324/9780203735114"", ""10.1515/9780791490853"", ""10.1386/stp.31.3.339_7""]","['Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0403 体育学', 0.7413), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7214)]]"

Anuj and Tejal met at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where they collaborated on Chingari chumma (Stinging Kiss, 2000)—a short video that turns a cliched Bollywood ending into a queer fairy-tale phantasy— as an experiment in post-pornography. In this conversation, the artists reflect on the beginnings of their collaboration, giving special attention to their process, their shared love for drag and camp, and to the complicated reception to their work. While Tejal returned to India soon after, the pair continued to remain in conversation over the decades, even as their own practices meandered into questions of gender performance, nation-state politics, activism, and eventually into concerns about the environment and the nonhuman. In their most recent works, the artists confront the legacy of human exceptionalism and invoke the forgotten wisdom of interspecies dependence and desire as a way through the sixth extinction.

Güney's film Umut (The Hope), which he acted and directed in 1970, is a turning point for Yılmaz Güney cinema and Turkish cinema. The breath of Marxism can be felt in almost all of Yılmaz Güney's films after The Hope. In his films, Güney aimed to convey to the audience the fundamental contradictions of Turkish capitalism, the socioeconomic inequalities it created, and the resulting class differences. It can be argued that Güney's films discussed within the scope of the study Umut, 1970 (The Hope), Endişe, 1974 (The Anxiety), Sürü, 1978 (The Herd), Düşman, 1979 (The Enemy) focus on social class differences in the capitalist system by relying on Marxist ideology. Although the reasons for these differences in the movies are associated with factors such as politics, ideology, religion, culture, family, and education, it is thought that the most significant share of the factors that play a role in the formation of social classes is given to the economy.

Le film s’inspire de l’autobiographie de Chris Kyle, légendaire tireur d’élite de l’armée américaine actif en Iraq, dont la vie et la mort après son retour aux États-Unis ont été célébrées dans les médias de tout le pays. L’article propose de réexaminer ce film d’un point de vue critique particulier, qu’on pourrait appeler le modèle de la vision double, caractéristique de nombreux films parmi les plus importants d’Eastwood. Analysé de ce point de vue, American Sniper révèle une superposition complexe de perspectives thématiques qui tendent à s’opposer. En particulier, cette lecture contredit la version triomphaliste existante de l’activité militaire et jette sur la stature héroïque de Kyle et, par extension, de la présence américaine en Iraq, un regard chargé d’un doute complexe.","[{""name"": ""William Beard"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Alberta, English and Film Studies, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada""]}]","[""10.1515/9780295805474-003""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1017/S0266464X22000331,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,The Translation of Protest: The Worldwide Readings Project of Andrei Kureichyk's Insulted. Belarus,"On 9 August 2020, Belarus erupted in protest over the falsified election results promoted and endorsed by existing president Aliaksandar Lukashenka. Playwright, director, and member of the Coordination Council for the peaceful transfer of power in Belarus, Andrei Kureichyk was one of the thousands on the streets that month. In early September he finished a new play depicting the events leading up to and surrounding the largest anti-government demonstrations in Belarus’s history. Before going into hiding, Kureichyk sent the play, Insulted. Belarus, to former Russian theatre critic John Freedman for translation. Together, the two men hoped to have a few theatres in various European and North American countries give a reading of the play in solidarity with the people of Belarus. Neither of them expected that, within two months, the play would be translated into eighteen languages and receive over seventy-seven readings on digital platforms. While many companies were eager to add their name to the global ledger of solidarity, the rise of authoritarianism, as well as the renewed reckoning with systemic racism and sexism in many cultures and countries around the world, additionally meant that many theatres found in the play a vehicle to reflect and comment on their own situations. This article, written by one of the initial participants of the project, attempts to chart how the Worldwide Readings of Insulted. Belarus navigated the translation of protest from Belarus to the world.

Correspondingly, each is thought to possess a distinct neural and physiological signature, accompanied by an expression that is universally recognized despite differences in culture, era, and language. An alternative, the theory of constructed emotion, emphasizes that, while the underlying interoceptive sensations are biological, emotional concepts are learned, socially constructed categories, characterized by many-to-many relationships among diverse brain states, physiological signs, facial movements, and their emotional meanings. This biocultural view permits a greater degree of cultural-historical specificity when interpreting the emotions of others. In this article, I consider the implications of the theory of constructed emotion for cognitive film theory, especially regarding the interpretation of depicted facial expressions of emotion as one aspect of cinematic expression. Particular attention is given to recent work revisiting the Kuleshov effect, in which the meaning of a character’s facial expression is thought to change in the context of a montage.","[{""name"": ""Timothy Justus"", ""affiliation"": [""Pitzer College, USA timothy_justus@pitzer.edu""]}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"

The aim is to expound any relationships between the film and Rubaiyat; therefore, according to the type of the applied quatrain, movie genre, plot, some categories are propounded to classify the movies in which Khayyam’s quatrains are quoted such as Transiency-Death, Transiency-Carpe Diem, Heaven and Hell, and Determinism. Indeed, these categories can be applied to the theme of the movies or a single scene in which the stanza is quoted.","[{""name"": ""Milad Minakar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amir Hossein Chitsazian"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

10.1386/jptv_00045_1,JOURNAL OF POPULAR TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,"The South Bank Show, popular music and the reframing of arts television","This article focuses on the framing of popular music on The South Bank Show (SBS) (1978–2010, 2012–present). Popular culture was central to SBS’s agenda from its very conception, framed by the title sequence by Pat Gavin and the choice of subject matter – the first ever episode was on Paul McCartney, signalling a mainstream cultural appeal and a cultural conservativism given the wider contemporary context of punk sensibility. Therefore, to understand SBS’s approach to popular music, we need to understand the context from which it emerges: the British broadcasting political economy of the late 1970s centred around the pre-choice duopoly and intense rivalry between the BBC and ITV, as well as a production environment centred around Melvyn Bragg. Yet, SBS was not a radical programme, and its focus on popular music over the years has largely been focused on mainstream artists and tastes – speaking to a mainstream audience rather than to avant-garde tastes. In assessing this history, this article considers two programmes from the SBS archive in some detail, as well as reflecting on how production cultures impact cultural outputs.","[{""name"": ""David Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368403 University of Leeds""]}]","[""10.1080/16522354.2008.11073473"", ""10.1080/09502388900490131"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2011.0042"", ""10.1080/13688804.2015.1025728"", ""10.1177/0163443711398693"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2015.0270"", ""10.1386/jptv_00041_1"", ""10.1177/1749602017746355"", ""10.1386/jptv_00045_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Urban Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

I show that, even though Sinister is a narrative about a demon who lives in images, the horror in the soundtrack of this trailer is articulated through the sound design. I describe the structure of the soundtrack and analyse the distribution and organisation of dialogue, the use of different types of sound effects to create a connection between the viewer and the characters onscreen, as well as the use of specific localised sound events to organise attention and to frighten the viewer. I identify two features not previously discussed in relation to quantitative analysis of film soundtracks: an affective event based on reactions to a stimulus and the presence of nonlinear features in the sound envelopes of localised affective events. The sound design of this trailer is consistent with the principles of contemporary sound design in horror cinema, but also demonstrates some variation in its use of sound as a paratext to its parent film.","[{""name"": ""Nick Redfern"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent scholar (United Kingdom )""]}]","[""10.2307/1213732"", ""10.3828/msmi.2014.8"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-49127-9_12"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jt.5740182"", ""10.19030/jber.v10i6.7028"", ""10.3167/proj.2014.080107"", ""10.1080/02650487.2015.1090521"", ""10.1016/j.patrec.2013.11.010"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-1119-9_7"", ""10.3828/msmi.2020.4"", ""10.1002/9781118883648.ch10"", ""10.4324/9781315733425""]","['Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Signal Processing']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7598), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7575)]]"

The analysis shows that although most of the techniques used by Nedić are appropriate, different translation solutions in specific cases would be more adequate in conveying the play’s main notion that language reveals one’s social class and shapes one’s identity.","[{""name"": ""Biljana Vlašković Ilić"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Kragujevac, Serbia""]}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"
10.1017/S0266464X22000173,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,The Sense of an Ending: Contemporary Visions of Medea,"The story of Medea’s murder of her own children to gain revenge against their faithless father has been tackled from many angles by playwrights and directors from Euripides’ time to the present. In recent years, due to highly sensationalized, real-life cases of mothers murdering their children, it has become fodder for sociologists, criminologists, psychologists, and feminists. Many recent productions (both original plays and directorial approaches to Euripides’ original) have avoided tackling the difficult questions raised by Euripides’ ending, which demands an answer to the following question: how could the gods send down a dragon-drawn chariot to rescue a woman who murdered her own children? Many contemporary authors and directors prefer to eliminate Euripides’ ending in order to focus on more immediate issues, such as the psychological or social damage resulting from patriarchy, colonialism, and misogyny. After considering several such productions, this article analyzes three plays that directly tackle Euripides’ troubling ending: two original scripts, by Heiner Müller and Carol Fisher Sorgenfrei respectively; and a production of Euripides’ original by Japanese director Miyagi Satoshi. Carol Fisher Sorgenfrei is Professor Emerita of Theatre at UCLA. An expert on postwar Japanese and cross-cultural performance, she is also a translator, director, and playwright. The author of Unspeakable Acts: The Avant-Garde Theatre of Terayama Shūji and Postwar Japan (University of Hawaii Press, 2005) and co-author of Theatre Histories: An Introduction (third edition, Routledge, 2016), she has published over a hundred articles, chapters, and reviews. She is an Associate Editor of Asian Theatre Journal and a Fellow of the College of Fellows of the American Theatre.","[{""name"": ""Carol Fisher Sorgenfrei"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"
10.1215/02705346-9561409,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,The Reserve Army of Affectivity: Unemployed Labor in William Greaves's Psychodramatic Cinema Verite,"Abstract This article offers a political reading of In the Company of Men (dir. William Greaves, US, 1969), an industrial human relations and training film that Newsweek magazine commissioned the renowned black American filmmaker William Greaves to make. Tasked by his sponsors with repairing communication between white factory foremen and black men who were labeled the hard-core unemployed, Greaves combines the documentary style of cinéma vérité with psychodrama, a group therapy method that uses theatrical techniques of role-play and reenactment to both reveal and treat social conflict. Situating psychodrama as both a gendered strategy of racial governance and a model of workplace training tied to the emerging social conditions of the deindustrializing United States, this article focuses on the labor performed by the unemployed black men within the therapeutic division of labor that Greaves's film indexes and reproduces. In doing so, it argues that Greaves's film not only documents contradictions of inclusion and recognition in the late 1960s, when the postwar ideology of racial liberalism was in decline, but it also anticipates the extractive racial politics of capitalism in the early twenty-first century, as people who have been consigned to the status of social and industrial excess are put into service for the emotional training of capital's managers.","[{""name"": ""Alex Pittman"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Different methods of scientific research were used in the study, namely analysis and synthesis, comparison, deduction, abstraction, formal legal method etc. Since independence, Kazakhstan’s multi-vector foreign policy has to some extent contributed to maintaining the balance of power in the region. Having chosen the professional diplomat Tokayev as his successor, Nazarbayev resigned on March 19, 2019, ushering in a new, unanalysed phase of the multi-vector foreign policy that has developed over the past 30 years. A theoretical analysis of the development of Kazakhstan’s foreign policy during the transition of power was carried out. It is concluded that during the transition of power, the multi-vector foreign policy develops in a new direction and in accordance with the priority of geo-economic values. The practical value of this research lies in the contribution to the literature of understanding the concept of multi-vector foreign policy or balance-based foreign policy during power transitions.","[{""name"": ""Nurbolat Nyshanbayev"", ""affiliation"": [""Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Republic of Kazakhstan""]}, {""name"": ""Kairat Bekov"", ""affiliation"": [""Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Republic of Kazakhstan""]}, {""name"": ""Zhulduz Baizakova"", ""affiliation"": [""Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Republic of Kazakhstan""]}, {""name"": ""Alipbayev Amangeldy"", ""affiliation"": [""Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Republic of Kazakhstan""]}]","[""10.4324/9781315674698"", ""10.1080/10758216.2015.1026788"", ""10.1080/09668136.2020.1779184"", ""10.1080/14662040601135813"", ""10.1080/13510347.2011.593310"", ""10.1080/19448950903152110"", ""10.1080/01495933.2018.1497352"", ""10.1080/02634937.2019.1596879"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.00058"", ""10.25253/99.2018204.11"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-10112-0_2"", ""10.30687/978-88-6969-550-6/011"", ""10.46493/2663-2675.33(5).2023.45-51"", ""10.1093/ia/iiaa061"", ""10.30687/978-88-6969-376-2/011""]","['Social Sciences', 'Energy']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'General Energy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.6919), ('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.6893)]]"

The study is based on the analysis of the database that was created within the framework of the research project The Social History of Hungarian Cinema. Concentrating on the representation of female protagonists, this article first analyses the presence and prevalence of female figures in all Hungarian sound films (up until 2015). Then it narrows the scope of analysis to films produced between 1931 and 1944, and describes the typical professions and social and financial positions of female protagonists, as compared to those of male protagonists. The second half of the text examines the representation of female upward mobility in comedies – showing that according to the popular myths of the era, female upward mobility is principally realized through good marriage, with the narratives of the films rarely presenting the professional success of female protagonists and their possibilities of emancipation. Analysing the narrative patterns and gender roles in the films of the time, the text concludes that the narratives of female ascension, which mostly took form in comedies, reflected the desire of middle-class people to transgress the social and financial boundaries in society. As such, the films served to maintain and strengthen the patriarchal order of the era.","[{""name"": ""Györgyi Vajdovich"", ""affiliation"": [""Eötvös Loránd University ( Budapest , Hungary )""]}]","[""10.1017/9789048530243""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

10.1515/jcde-2024-2003,JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY DRAMA IN ENGLISH,1303 Drama Film and Television,The Poetics and Politics of We-Narration on the Contemporary British Stage,"Abstract We-narratives are proliferating in the contemporary novel. Constructing a collective subject that cannot be reduced to a singular individual who speaks for the group, they have been hailed by narratologists as remarkable fictional possibilities. This article registers a similar increase of plural narration in contemporary drama and explores how an analysis of the phenomenon’s linguistic dimension can be combined with a consideration of these plays’ orientation towards performance. Drawing on British examples, we chart an intriguing variety of we-narratives and argue that the political potential of these forms of community building lies in their turn away from mimesis and dramatic realism. Rather than merely representing a collective entity on stage, they also forge one in and through performance and frequently unsettle the conventional identification of one voice with one body. Thus, contemporary uses of “we” model the relationship between stage and auditorium in ways that assert, but also interrogate, the potential for community building in the shared space of the theatre.","[{""name"": ""Dorothee Birke"", ""affiliation"": [""Innsbruck University , Innsbruck , Austria""]}, {""name"": ""Janine Hauthal"", ""affiliation"": [""Vrije Universiteit Brussel , Brussels , Belgium""]}]","[""10.5040/9781350208186.00000104"", ""10.1515/jcde-2020-0002"", ""10.1515/9783110555158-006"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199670574.003.0021"", ""10.1007/s41244-018-0103-9"", ""10.5040/9781350209831.00000003"", ""10.4324/9780203088104"", ""10.1136/medhum-2016-011156"", ""10.5040/9781350180888.ch-5"", ""10.3138/9781442673908"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511553998"", ""10.28914/Atlantis-2020-42.2.10"", ""10.1076/ejes.7.1.69.14827""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

An earlier generation of auteurs such as Aki Kaurismäki used adaptation to align themselves with aesthetic and philosophical bodies of texts, what we might call ‘networks of similarity’, following Luis M. García Mainar. In the rise of Nordic noir since the millennium, Nordic cinema and television’s networks of similarity change. The auteurs used adaptation to establish modernist originality of vision. In the current moment, this quality has diminished, and adaptation increasingly figures in broader, more densely cross-referential networks of similarity, of which Nordic noir is arguably an instantiation. These are defined by aesthetic and sociopolitical associations, more so than originality. These associations figure in practitioners’ and textual consumers’ use of response to and replication of the noir texts and their networks in a variety of media. This activity can be understood as a type of branding that aligns with attempts at national and regional branding.","[{""name"": ""Andrew Nestingen"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122986657 University of Washington""]}]","[""10.1386/jptv.3.1.21_1"", ""10.1086/226788"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-38658-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-38658-0_9"", ""10.1386/jsca_00041_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

The 21st century journey departs from entirely opposite premises than those of the ancient journey, namely with the desire to escape one’s birthplace. The aim of the exile has also transformed: from a necessary step to secure one’s livelihood or even life, it has become one of exploration. Rather than the desire to settle elsewhere or to eventually return home, the exile sets on an open-ended, exploratory journey the premise of which is finding oneself. In this, the physical journey has come to resemble the metaphysical one of the artist. The exile departs from a physical place and journeys into a metaphysical space, geography becoming secondary while still being necessary. This journey is best recounted in the film Synonymes (2019) by Israeli director Nadav Lapid, an autobiographical tale that chronicles the director’s own exile from Israel to Paris and captures his journey toward becoming an artist. The paper references two prominently antinostalgic authors: 20th century Polish writer Witold Gombrowicz and Polsih-Jewish writer Henryk Grynberg.","[{""name"": ""Jora Vaso"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Communication', 'Philosophy', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

Adaptation critics, including Douglas M. Lanier, Jennifer Camden, and Kate Faber Oestrich, have tended to focus on relatively high-profile Austen and Shakespeare vlog adaptations, especially those produced by Pemberley Digital. In this article, I update the genre’s genealogy by turning instead to later waves of low-budget creativity that have taken this transmedia form in new directions since the peak years of the literary-inspired web series in the mid-2010s. I pay particular attention to Quip Modest’s Public History–A David Copperfield Web Series (2019–20), a relatively rare example of a Dickens adaptation in the web series format which remoulds the multi-generational three-decker saga into an LGBTQIA+ positive coming-of-age narrative for the Generation Z audience. My contextualised close reading of the adaptation simultaneously reframes our understanding of Dickens’s digital canonicity and helps us better grasp the cultural logic of the literary web series adaptation community.","[{""name"": ""Chris Louttit"", ""affiliation"": [""Radboud Institute for Culture & History, Radboud University , Nijmegen, The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.7560/TSLL61401"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96544-4"", ""10.1353/elh.1997.0002"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195160512.001.0001"", ""10.1353/nlh.2013.0035"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199566099.001.0001"", ""10.7560/TSLL61404"", ""10.1080/09699082.2018.1510884"", ""10.1215/00982601-3483864""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

10.3366/film.2021.0164,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,The Kierkegaardian Existentialism of Richard Linklater's Before Trilogy,"This article examines the Kierkegaardian existentialism set in motion by Richard Linklater's Before trilogy: Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004), and Before Midnight (2013). In doing so, it asserts the efficacy of cinema as a medium of existential import, one that is particularly suited to give form to Søren Kierkegaard's project. The identification of three existential stages of life – the aesthetic, ethical, and religious – is perhaps Kierkegaard's most notable contribution to philosophy. This article contends that Linklater's aesthetic strategy – namely, his distinctive use of long dialogic takes and open endings – grapples with these existential categories: the aesthetic and ethical existence-spheres, as well as the border zone of irony that rests between them. By mapping the shifting utility of the long take and open endings throughout the trilogy, the article charts the differing existential states of the trilogy's enduring couple, Jesse and Céline, as well as the ensuing complications that arise from their clash. In particular, the Before trilogy demonstrates the difficulty of reconciling aesthetic desire and ethical responsibility. Focusing on this dilemma, the article goes on to discuss how the differing existential states of Jesse and Céline prevent a proper appropriation of the ethical requirement into their lives, and that this existential disparity is what eventually surfaces the dysfunction of their romantic union.","[{""name"": ""Zachary Xavier"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Scholar""]}]","[""10.1017/CCOL0521471516.006"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511809699"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521471516.001"", ""10.1057/9780230598652"", ""10.1525/fq.2015.68.3.60"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521471516.004"", ""10.7312/ston17920""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

For the paved, lighted, and policed streets as well as water and sewage, one may, the next time the tax collector arrives, as Shaw puts it, “hear his knock with joy, and welcome him with the beaming face of the willing giver.” Yet, he goes on, “the truth is that Capitalism plunders citizens through the Government and the municipalities and County Councils as effectually as it does through the shopkeeper.” To provide public services, national and local governments buy large quantities of goods from private businesses, which profiteer by charging more than cost. Overcharges are then passed to taxpayers. The joy of taxes, then, if it arrives, may come in the future.","[{""name"": ""Bernard F.

This article reveals the connections between the projects and theatre, television and cinema productions of some of the protagonists of that extraordinary adventure by tracing the power plays that marked the period. As they understood, it was a time when one would believe in the possibility of implementing a modern theatre supported by the state and an art cinema, expected to be adored by a public and which still had to be formed. These goals united a generation and motivated its migration to the other side of the Atlantic. It was a ‘mission’ based on the belief that the arts, especially the performing arts, should be tools for the democratic emancipation of the public and not just occasions for its entertainment. Their tasks, illusions, disappointments and legacies are inscribed in plays and films, which I illustrate in this article.","[{""name"": ""Alessandra Vannucci"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012294473X Federal University of Rio de Janeiro""]}]","[""10.1386/jicms_00121_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['Speech and Hearing', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Drawing upon extensive research at the British Board of Film Classification archives, this article complicates dominant narratives of British censorship in highlighting how John Trevelyan, appointed as Secretary of the BBFC in 1958 and frequently depicted as a liberalising force, deferred to psychiatric expertise outside the BBFC in making decisions about film censorship and certification and, in some instances, scriptwriting and editing. This article will explain how a proliferation of American and, later, British films dealing with mental illness caused BBFC examiners to lose confidence in their ability to make censorship decisions in the mid-1960s. Initially, this loss of confidence prompted consultation with the influential British mental health organisation, the National Association for Mental Health (NAMH) and, subsequently, a small group of trusted medical professionals, referred to as ‘psychiatrist friends’, who decided on cuts and certification of films including The Caretakers (1963), The Collector (1965) and Repulsion (1965). As a result, the BBFC moved from a default position of prohibition to one of enabling ‘serious’ films that promoted mental health awareness and discussion of contemporary mental health issues. This article aims to offer new insights into the policies, processes and practices of the BBFC, to contextualise censorship within historical debates about mental health representation and to highlight the mutually productive interactions that took place between the fields of mental health and cinema.","[{""name"": ""Tim Snelson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""William R.

I argue that the field of adaptation studies makes a fundamental but often overlooked assumption in its self-definition: that author and adaptors pre-date the works they are creating. I propose instead that an author doesn’t create a work, but that a work creates an author. This is not universally true, but material in eras and locations in which legal institutions attempt to define authorship. My observation is relevant when considering the modern institution of copyright and the effect IP laws have had on the environment generative of adaptations. The consequences of these effects result in authorship often assigned after the creation of a work and lengthy legal hand-wringing.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Layman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, The University of Connecticut , 95 Varga Road, Apt. 219, Ashford, CT 06278 , USA""]}]","[""10.4324/9781315690254-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808678"", ""10.2307/2738129""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

She follows the connection between the emerging visualization of Daenerys with the tiny dragons and ancient depictions of Goddesses and dragons, and connects this motif to feminist scholars who researched the revival of feminine language in the 1970s and the 1980s of the 20th century. The article also suggests that the nudity of women depicted in fantastic art, particularly in images with women and dragons, are not necessarily titillating but representative of the early feminist stage of women seeking a symbolic power figure. The author also contrasts Daenerys’s visualization with those images, suggesting how she demonstrates the evolution of the motif in light of the changing focal points of feminist movements. Daenerys’s image, she suggests, reflects one of the central issues of the Me Too phenomenon – considering the female body as a sanctuary, which even if exposed and suggestive, is dangerous and forbidden to touch.","[{""name"": ""Sharon Khalifa-Gueta"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Haifa ( Israel )""]}]","[""10.2307/505328"", ""10.4324/9781315091426"", ""10.1017/9781787441941"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004171015.i-319"", ""10.1515/9781400842056"", ""10.1017/CCOL052179188X"", ""10.5871/bacad/9780197265963.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oxartj/25.2.127"", ""10.1002/9780470696507"", ""10.2307/3258814"", ""10.2307/498438"", ""10.2307/29764903"", ""10.5209/eiko.76756"", ""10.30958/ajms.4-4-1"", ""10.2307/1772126"", ""10.1525/9780520915312-006"", ""10.1002/9780470774007"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199557325.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781501302930.ch-005"", ""10.1515/9781400864584""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

10.1017/S0307883323000172,THEATRE RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,1303 Drama Film and Television,The Forgotten History of Our Times: Revisiting Utpal Dutt's Titu Mir in Contemporary India,"This paper is an exploration of the most recent revival of Utpal Dutt's play Titu Mir in 2019 by the ensemble group Theatre Formation Paribartak in India. Islamic religious reformer Titu Mir led a peasant rebellion from 1827 to 1831 in the Barasat region of Bengal and the play focuses on a narrative of revolutionary resistance to colonialism. Titu Mir becomes an articulation of political theatre against the Hindu right-wing agenda of expunging Muslim national heroes from Indian history. This essay seeks Titu Mir's relevance as a site and theory of materializing historical contradictions, and as part of a ‘gestic’ feminist criticism of theatre. The essay attempts to understand how critique of patriarchal ideology is enmeshed in critique of colonialism in Titu Mir, especially in those moments where the play addresses complexities of political violence, interracial romance, martyrdom, alienation in the colony and deep-rooted misogyny in the project of colonialism.","[{""name"": ""MALLARIKA SINHA ROY"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Why are seasoned professional performers increasingly being drawn to this practice? What kinds of adaptations and considerations does a clown artist undertake to move from the world of theatre and performance to the world of health care and compassionate service? Beginning with a brief look at the evolution of therapeutic clowning in Canada and abroad, the authors turn to a deeper consideration of practices in pediatric, adult, and dementia-care settings. Child life and clown doctor pediatric models of therapeutic clown are delineated, as is the Elder-clown approach used by many practitioners working with older people in long-term care and community care. The authors emphasize the importance of reciprocity and co-created play between practitioner(s) and the people they serve and consider the role these play in bolstering resilience, vitality, and a sense of agency in the lives of vulnerable people in hospital and institutionalized care settings. The article also emphasizes that foundational clown training and performance experience alongside specialized training are crucial for therapeutic clown practitioners. Throughout, poignant vignettes illustrate and illuminate the complex, challenging, and rewarding dimensions of therapeutic clown practice.","[{""name"": ""Kathleen Le Roux"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Stirling-Twist"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1471301215580895""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Medicine']","['Conservation', 'Social Psychology', 'Psychiatry and Mental health']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)]]"

To provide the needed empirical evidence for this research work, some experiments with a representative sample of viewers were conducted. These experiments confirmed the existence of direct relationships between various colors of lighting and the perceived appearance and mood of film characters. Moreover, specific color hues of lighting appeared to be more effective than others in altering the perceived appearance and mood of film characters.

The lack of European-wide strategic thinking creates the conditions for an existential crisis of the EU. The EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy/Common Security and Defence Policy is the most striking example: it fails to manage the EU27 expectations, build up sufficient military and civilian capabilities, deliver tangible results and, consequently, lacks credibility. This has repercussions for the EU’s level of ambition. Until 2030, more and more states drop out of EU initiatives and search for alternative fora to make their voices heard in international politics. The powerlessness of the EU also weakens its most important allies: the United States and NATO. This creates a power vacuum to be filled by more ambitious players, such as China or Russia, which seek to diffuse their view of global (dis)order. To avoid this future, we argue that the EU should (1) embrace an alternative vision of power, (2) strengthen the legitimacy of its internal and external policymaking and (3) engage strategically in global affairs on the basis of a firm commitment to NATO-EU cooperation.","[{""name"": ""Cornelia-Adriana Baciu"", ""affiliation"": [""Johns Hopkins University - School of Advanced International Studies, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Alexandra M Friede"", ""affiliation"": [""Helmut Schmidt University/University of the Federal Armed Forces, Germany""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-12418-2"", ""10.1177/1369148116685274"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-12418-2_6"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00351"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-2790-9"", ""10.1017/S002081830001897X"", ""10.4159/9780674041660"", ""10.4324/9781315602141"", ""10.54648/EERR2015028"", ""10.13109/9783666101496"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-69517-4""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Finance', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

10.3138/md.63.4.1069,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,The Domestic Sphere as Counter-Surveillance in Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun,"Lorraine Hansberry was placed under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation prior to A Raisin in the Sun’s Broadway debut in 1959. Totalling over a thousand pages of memos, reports, and letters of investigative analysis, Hansberry’s FBI file reveals that the bureau tracked her play for Communist sympathies but also, and more surprisingly, collected interviews in which she insisted that her occupation was not playwright but housewife. This essay returns to A Raisin in the Sun, which has often been seen to uphold conservative gender ideologies of the Cold War era, to explore how Hansberry depicted radical counter-surveillance against the state through housewife characters. While historians have discussed how Black domestic workers employed in white homes became politically involved, little has been done to document how Black women countered surveillance to protect their families in their own homes. Drawing from evidence found in Hansberry’s archive at the Schomburg Center, this article contextualizes A Raisin in the Sun among her unpublished writings and the play’s manuscript drafts to argue that Hansberry deliberately subverted discourses that viewed surveillance as a practice primarily affecting individuals and families within isolated domestic environments. I show that Hansberry turned to drama to portray surveillance as a communal experience, thereby shifting narratives of surveillance from those found within earlier twentieth-century fiction depicting lone male protagonists on the run from state oversight to a dramatic oral mode that insists on communal experience through direct communication between performers and audience.","[{""name"": ""Kelsey Kiser"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469634371.001.0001"", ""10.2307/3041585"", ""10.1215/9780822394402"", ""10.1353/arq.1992.0003"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195120547.001.0001"", ""10.3138/md.0723""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

According to Michel Foucault, and later Giorgio Agamben and Roberto Esposito, it is chiefly the association of humans with biological danger that causes biopolitics to mutate into thanatopolitics. However, in these two films, humans are construed as an ecological danger that prompt thanatopolitics. They depict futures in which the regimes in power act on ecological threats by brutally micromanaging and killing members of their populations. In this the films unveil how the idea of sustainability as equilibrium can never benefit all, but must always leave some human beings out, either by abandoning them to die or by actively killing them. This is important because it brings to light the risk that the Anthropocene could engender regimes that will kill on different grounds than regimes have in the past.","[{""name"": ""Gregers Andersen"", ""affiliation"": [""Aalborg University""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-40337-3"", ""10.5749/9781452962054"", ""10.1111/gto.12244""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

She was the soul of dramatic rhythm and vocal composition for the company’s productions, directing numerous plays and researching each actor’s spoken part. Author and producer of sound theatre since the 1990s, she has also created an intense artistic experience with children as part of her research and analysis of the relationship between voice and childhood, which has earned her several awards, including an Ubu Prize in 2013. In this interview1 she discusses the early projects of Societas Raffaello Sanzio, which explored immersive, environmental performances for and with children – a line of research within the company’s multidirectional and overlapping experimental activity that she led.

While the catalyst method is based on participatory video methodology, it uses film primarily for interpersonal communication, and its main goal is the use of the camera as a group cohesion and intergroup catalyst. The method addresses the representation and self-representation of participants along social fault lines through filmmaking, it is based on the principle of dialogue and aims at community building and participation. The method is hopefully applicable in other countries, as the democratising potential of participatory filmmaking for at least partially redressing existing inequalities can be utilized in other locations as well.1","[{""name"": ""Sára Haragonics"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Researcher ( Budapest , Hungary )""]}]","[""10.32564/124.4"", ""10.20520/JEL-KEP.2020.2.129""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

More specifically, I plan to situate Jarmusch’s arthouse action film Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999) between Ludwig Wittgenstein and Jacques Derrida in order to demonstrate the profound affinities between Jarmusch’s film-philosophy and Wittgenstein’s conception of ordinary language. Through a consideration of character dialogue, I will demonstrate the extent to which Jarmusch rejects the private language argument – which, by extension, amounts to a rejection of linguistic relativism as an instance, or species, of skepticism – in favor of ordinary conceptions of language, expressiveness, knowledge, and responsibility.","[{""name"": ""Kyle Barrowman"", ""affiliation"": [""DePaul University""]}]","[""10.5325/jaynrandstud.17.2.0153"", ""10.1515/9780748653690-031"", ""10.4324/9781003001669"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-2089-7"", ""10.1525/aa.1986.88.2.02a00080"", ""10.5040/9781350071322"", ""10.3726/978-3-653-01928-5"", ""10.5040/9781628928839""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

10.3138/md-65-4-1239,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,The Afterlives of Enslavement: Histories of Racial Injustice in Contemporary Black British Theatre,"Over the past five years, a number of Black British women authors have written what might be called postcolonial ghost plays. This article focuses, to varying degrees, on four: ear for eye (2018), debbie tucker green’s dissection of enslavement and its afterlives; Rockets and Blue Lights (2020), Winsome Pinnock’s historical film-within-a-play about the Middle Passage; The Gift (2020), Janice Okoh’s semi-biography of an African girl who became Queen Victoria’s ward; and Selina Thompson’s salt. (2018), an autobiographical performance piece tracing her ancestors’ enslavement. Ghosts and haunting, which I examine from multiple perspectives, appear across this range of theatrical genres. With their multiple, doubled, spectral, interpenetrating stories, tucker green, Pinnock, Okoh, and Thompson’s postcolonial ghost plays reactivate the past of enslavement that has not passed, that is still active in the form of racial and social injustices today. Ghosts, prevalent across the plays, represent the dead who, plumbing the depths of the Middle Passage, are denied a resting place. The ghost, the figure of the living dead par excellence, reflects the dehumanization of trafficked Africans, from whom their enslavers sought to subtract all subjectivity. Ghosts, too, reveal the work of mourning performed by the living for those who were never properly buried. This mourning exposes and disrupts enduring structures of injustice, and searches for reparation. Ghosts, or revenants, returning and refusing to rest, represent the resilient resistance to injustice. Finally, ghosts, neither fully past nor present, absent or present, symbolize indeterminacy and instability, illustrated in the plays by subjects determined to take control of their own identities and destinies. Together, these plays demonstrate how we must look back to the roots of historical racism in order to look forward to its eradication.","[{""name"": ""Clare Finburgh Delijani"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-34581-5"", ""10.1215/00382876-100-1-61"", ""10.1163/156916302320277592"", ""10.1215/9780822384700-002"", ""10.3138/md.s1023r"", ""10.4324/9780203482810"", ""10.4324/9781315404905"", ""10.1215/00382876-101-4-757"", ""10.1215/03335372-2007-019"", ""10.4324/9780203813300"", ""10.5040/9781784605858.00000002"", ""10.1080/01440390802027913"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195125337.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674043770"", ""10.5040/9780571354894""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

10.1515/jcde-2020-0012,JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY DRAMA IN ENGLISH,1303 Drama Film and Television,"The ""Ordinary"" Cruelty and the Theatre as Witness in Four South African Plays","AbstractThis essay looks at how four contemporary South African plays use performance to render, address, and acknowledge personal and national trauma. By staging acts of cruelty that happen as “ordinary” experience, as perpetual pain, or as representation of life-in-crisis, these plays not only question and complement the national narrative by telling stories that have not found a stage or a listener before, but they also inform and speak to topical societal issues in South Africa such as that of apathy to violence and the question of complicity. Yael Farber and Lara Foot employ a distinctly South African theatre language that draws on theatrical concepts of the European avant-garde, especially those of Antonin Artaud, as well as on the tradition of oral storytelling and ritual to render cruelty as the “ordinary” and crisis as an ongoing condition in the sociohistorical context of apartheid and the apartheid-influenced post-1994 world. By excavating, tracing, and acknowledging “ordinary” cruelty as experienced personally and collectively, the plays explore revelations about the human condition, open up a discussion on the nature of memory or (collective) amnesia, on trauma, complicity, and the crucial role of the witness.","[{""name"": ""Elisabeth Knittelfelder"", ""affiliation"": [""University of GrazAustria""]}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This chapter introduces the importance of a critical and grounded approach to the phenomenon and outlines the key themes discussed in the monograph. It argues that the roots of temporary urbanism lie in established Western cultural tropes depicting vacancy and temporariness as urban social and spatial alterity. Linking its establishment to dynamics of austerity policymaking and urban restructuring, it contends that temporary urbanism has become a key imaginary in a recurrent urban crisis landscape geared towards greater life and place insecurity. The need for a situated and longitudinal approach undergirds the rationale behind a semi-ethnographic focus on the glamorisation of austerity culture in post-2008 London.","[{""name"": ""Mara Ferreri"", ""affiliation"": [""Northumbria University""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Urban Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

The subjectivity that arises out of the complex interactions between the listener and their prosthetic memory can be characterised as what Olga Beloborodova has called ‘postcognitivist’. Considering Krapp's relationship with his tapes from this postcognitivist perspective suggests how the construction of an abiding subject in the information age simultaneously depends upon and is imperilled by the particular technologies that project the voice into the dark. With that in mind, this article also explores how some users on the contemporary counterparts to Krapp's tapes – online platforms like YouTube, Reddit, and 4chan – weaponise the mediated nostalgia that infects Krapp's relationship with his own past to construct a nationalist political identity built on the manufacture of collective counterfactual memory.","[{""name"": ""Ken Alba"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1556/2006.6.2017.058"", ""10.1017/9781108771108"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-70374-9_16"", ""10.1177/1742715018793744"", ""10.1093/analys/58.1.7"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9715.003.0008"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780199551378.001.0001"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816650477.003.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226321394.001.0001"", ""10.1163/18757405-024001019""]","['Computer Science', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Computer Science Applications', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

The Haunting of Hill House is a recent example of these Netflix original miniseries.

It traditionally been held that language performs two basic functions (cognitive and communicative) and a number of complementary ones: aesthetical, emotional, meta-linguistic, orientating, manipulative, etc. In contrast with the traditional view we argue that all complementary functions are in fact nothing else but various specifications of the third basic function – the interpreting one. It grounds in the interpretive nature of cognition and language themselves, in their obvious integrity and is substantiated at the categorical level of language evincing special interpretive (modus) categories and tools of meaning construction. This assumption constitutes the Interpretive Commitment of any cognitive theory of language and the nature of that commitment is also substantiated in the article as well the types of linguistic interpretation and the cognitive models and schemas underlying it. Specifically, the article distinguishes between primary and secondary linguistic interpretation as its basic types, models of interpretation of the physical world and society, and those of interpretation of knowledge about the world and society. Some specific functions and types of linguistic interpretation are also outlined, among them selective interpretation, classification, and evaluation.","[{""name"": ""Nikolay N.

As digital transformation deepens, the image of the digital future, encompassing expectations, assumptions, and perceptions about individual, societal, and state development in the era of digitalization across various aspects of life and production, assumes a paramount role in this process. Its dissemination in media space plays a pivotal role in shaping citizens’ future outlook and can significantly influence their perception of the world and subsequent actions. This study aims to explore the relationship between the formation of the digital future image in media space and its representation within the public consciousness. The authors conducted a comparative analysis of the saturation of digital society markers in media space and the public’s level of knowledge about digital technologies. Additionally, they assessed the tone of media texts containing digital future markers and examined their reception among the population. Furthermore, the key stakeholders of digital transformation and agents of influence in the presentation of the digital future were identified, along with the primary recipients and mediators of the prosocial image of the digital future. The study also investigated the media tools employed to disseminate the digital future image. Based on their findings, the authors present an overarching conclusion emphasizing the necessity of developing a vision of the digital future as an integral part of state policy to support the digital development of Russian society.","[{""name"": ""VITALY V.

Both technologies gather granular data on human bodies; however, AI does so in the virtual realm, whereas DvT necessitates a physical encounter. As a contribution to theory, this article raises questions about whether interactions with technological interfaces are actual, virtual or somewhere in-between, and about where our bodies intersect in that dimensional landscape. Is it possible for practitioners of drama therapy, specifically DvT, to be in conversation with the growing dominance of technologies operated through AI, and where do the boundaries of human territory fit in relation to both? The relationship between these two approaches to data gathering are explored through the use of arts-based research in the form of collage.

These traditions can be characterised by their distinct spatial orientation, while similarly shifting focus away from the centrality of representing character and human subjectivity. Contemporary eco-drama retains this spatial orientation established by the landscape play (Gertrude Stein) and environmental theatre (Richard Schechner) but breaks with their displacement of character by developing an aesthetic mode which stages the formation of human subjectivity as deeply intertwined with concrete places. This article shows how Rapp’s plays turn places into “symptomatic spaces” in Una Chaudhuri’s sense that signify a deep interdependence between human subjectivity and nonhuman nature. My reading focuses on how Rapp’s plays contribute to the formation and the conceptualisation of a distinctly “Anthropocenic imaginary” in contemporary American drama.","[{""name"": ""Julia Rössler"", ""affiliation"": [""Catholic University of Eichstätt- Ingolstadt Germany""]}]","[""10.1057/9781137011695_1"", ""10.1515/jcde-2020-0003"", ""10.1080/13528165.2012.712243"", ""10.5040/9781472511072.0007"", ""10.7788/9783412502393-016"", ""10.13109/9783666317217.119"", ""10.1215/01610775-25-1-23"", ""10.1515/jcde-2015-0002"", ""10.4324/9780203894989"", ""10.3998/mpub.11713"", ""10.2307/j.ctt2005s83"", ""10.1515/ANGL.2006.122"", ""10.56021/9780801852725"", ""10.2307/1144353""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Quick and easy as well as cheap travel has mobilized humankind and created worldwide and constant migration. Now, we do not have to leave our place to see the people of the faraway world of whom, so far, we have had merely vague ideas through rumors and fairy tales: rather these people visit us in our home. From every part of the world, fantastically colorful groups proceed from time to time before our eyes. Whatever is pleasant, great, and fine on Earth, all visit us. Groups of Italians, French, Negroes, and English are coming here and offering the divine products of their homelands.Egressy shared this observation with readers when the black, British-American actor Ira Aldridge visited the National Theatre in 1853. Aldridge and his English company received a warm welcome from Hungarian audiences and leading intellectuals. At the same time, however, he was under surveillance by the Habsburg secret police, and was later politely asked to leave the city.

They tend to defy being overwhelmed by sorrow, fear or even their helplessness in the face of adversity. Consequently, despite the global hysteria that has trailed the outbreak of the dreaded coronavirus, Nigerians stoically manage their grief through humour. The growing predilection for humour production and consumption in the country, which is partly occasioned by the advent of social media and an unprecedented growth of the Night of a Thousand Laughs (a stand-up comedy industry), deserves scholarly attention on account of its social and mental health impacts. This work blends Freudian psychoanalysis with Merton’s functional analysis to build a framework of analysis that captures the psychogenesis and consequences of Nigerians’ humorous response to the coronavirus pandemic. Semiotic method was used to analyse some selected humorous memes, cartoons, pictures and videos on or about COVID-19 obtained from WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube between March and August, 2020. In so doing, these humorous stuffs were subjected to both broad and context specific analyses. It was found that although the humours were expressed in different styles, they are mostly aggressive (intended to ridicule their leaders using satire, sarcasm), and self-enhancing (used as mechanisms to cope with boredom and anxiety occasioned by the pandemic) and, in a few cases, self-defeating (involved self-mockery: use of remarks that are self-demeaning or self-disparaging). The article concludes that the COVID-19-induced humours are a route to their peddlers’ unconscious realm and a defence mechanism to anxiety, stress and boredom. While the spread of these jokes has manifest function of self-enhancing, their latent consequence is that they trivialize the pandemic and, by extension, make people reluctant to take precautionary measures and comply with the established guidelines and protocols.","[{""name"": ""Aminu Ali"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012288989X Bayero University""]}]","[""10.1515/humr.15.4.365"", ""10.5964/ejop.v10i3.746"", ""10.1002/j.1556-6676.2001.tb01943.x"", ""10.5964/ejop.v12i3.1119"", ""10.1016/S0092-6566(02)00534-2"", ""10.5964/ejop.v12i3.1119"", ""10.1093/afraf/adn086"", ""10.1037/1061-4087.47.3.160"", ""10.5465/amp.2006.20591005"", ""10.1386/jams_00076_1""]",['Psychology'],"['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

British responses to the HIV/AIDS pandemic have been scarce, and when they have been present, have only occurred fleetingly. It’s a Sin (2021) is an unusual portrayal of HIV/AIDS in popular culture in its quintessential Britishness. Using the concept of stiff upper lip, as a stereotype of British affect, this article explores the ways in which different social classes in the series deal with the fact of homosexuality, and the growing threat of HIV/AIDS in the ten years between 1981 and 1991. The higher the social class, the more repressed and colder the characters are. This is further expressed through affect, and through the mise en scène of the family’s homes. The 1980s is often represented in popular culture as a decade of economic decline and poverty. Yet, It’s a Sin is a unique portrayal of life in 1980s London, which begins with confidence and freedom, and ends with a new strata of people who go on to transcend the social class exigencies of their families.","[{""name"": ""Ashley Morgan"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000120341556 Cardiff Metropolitan University""]}]","[""10.1093/oxfordjournals.esr.a036335"", ""10.1111/soc4.12134"", ""10.1179/1752627213Z.00000000021"", ""10.2307/2096120"", ""10.1177/0891243205278639"", ""10.1093/esr/jcr038"", ""10.1080/19419899.2017.1383303"", ""10.1177/1354067X14526895"", ""10.1111/j.1467-954X.2011.02035.x"", ""10.1386/jptv_00100_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This is despite years of interventions – including pushing for affirmative action – targeted at improving their status and working conditions. In this study, we argue that part of the solution lies in conscientizing women in media to become more aware of the inequalities they face. Through a nationwide survey of women in the Ghanaian media and premised on feminist media theory, we show that though progress is visible in the status of women, inequalities persist. Respondents were ambivalent about status parity with males, pointing to the possibility that they acquiesce to unfair practices because they are unaware of the embedded inequality. We discuss these findings and their implications for scholarship and practice.","[{""name"": ""Abena A.

Based on accounts by producers, composers and graphic designers, this article will provide a historical analysis of the changing image of Play for Today through the close analysis of its seven title sequences. Focusing on how the different sequences invested the strand with a particular identity and prepared audiences for the plays that followed, it identifies two main modes of address. It argues that the Play for Today image was at its most startling during the periods 1971–3 and 1977–82 when the title sequences signalled to viewers that Play for Today would present important – often politicised – drama with a proximity to the news. Other sequences – during 1973–7 – sought instead to ‘seduce’ viewers by foregrounding the strand’s humanism and eclecticism.","[{""name"": ""Tom May"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5040/9781838711009"", ""10.1093/screen/24.4-5.125"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16279-6"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195368406.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

In line with this movement, independent and subsidized theatres produced plays engaging with Armenian history through diverse political and aesthetic agendas. Among these works, public and state theatre productions remained mostly invisible in theatre scholarship due to their ambiguous position that does not directly align with the framework of political theatre. This article examines the adaptation of the Ottoman Armenian playwright Hagop Baronian's Adamnapuyj aravelyan (1868) as Şark Dişçisi (The Oriental Dentist) (2011) by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality City Theatres (İBBŞT). While promoting confrontation with the past, Şark Dişçisi eliminates the crucial political insights of its source text and their ramifications for contemporary demands for historical justice regarding the 1915 Armenian Genocide. The intersection of revisionist theatre historiography and broader political dynamics in the adaptation process reveals the ambivalences of post-Genocide memory work in Turkey.","[{""name"": ""ŞEYDA NUR YILDIRIM"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Barefoot in Athens (1951), staged during the period of McCarthyism and the outbreak of the Korean War, investigates those political events and their impact on free speech, dramatizing the marginalization of the intellectual through parallels with the life and trial of Socrates of Athens in 399 BCE. I draw on critics including Julien Benda and Edward Said, as well as Martin’s Puchner’s discussion of the “Socrates Play” genre, to triangulate Anderson’s vision of the public intellectual as a truth-seeker whose social commitments propel him to interrogate powerful authorities and expose non-democratic principles. In Barefoot, Anderson diagnoses the pathologies of contemporary American democracy through his depictions of the last weeks of Socrates’ life, portraying the great thinker not as an aloof philosopher but as an engaged intellectual. In this way, Anderson leverages the long tradition of the “Socrates Play” to cast a light on the political forces that sought to sideline and silence public intellectuals during his own era while seeking new definitions of and roles for the public intellectual based on the evaluation of past models.","[{""name"": ""Ramin Farhadi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/9780470996805"", ""10.1093/crj/clr001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198149798.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199730322.001.0001""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Philosophy', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

For one organism to live, others must die, turning first into food, then units of energy, and then fodder for new life. Performance itself is a play between liveliness and stabilizations, sensory immediacy and documented pasts. In the culture and practice of food, parallels abound. A notable yet humble example is witnessed in fermentation practice and the use of starter cultures, whether bacterial, yeasty, or both. Even as such cultures are consumed by a production process, they are renewed by it. This autoethnographic account of a cycle of three performances centred on an inherited sourdough starter explores the ways in which performance with food can act as a process of preservation, as well as an exploration of life, death, and states of being that may exist in between. In using a yeast culture that is more than 25 years old, I have attempted not only to perpetuate the tiny bodies within the flour-water paste but also to embody in a larger way the attitude and essence of the culture’s original user. Probing the preservation of humanness through food practice and artistic improvisation, I propose an alternate sense of memory, ecology, and mortality.","[{""name"": ""David Szanto"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.15353/cfs-rcea.v3i1.148""]","['Social Sciences', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Geography, Planning and Development', 'Food Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)]]"

Shifting the focus of screenwriting from the sole goal of production to a twin goal of publication first and then production opened up a number of creative and scholarly avenues for the writer and means that the script will find an audience (a readership) irrespective of production. It also means that the textual qualities of the script are foregrounded.

10.1386/slac_00058_1,STUDIES IN SPANISH & LATIN AMERICAN CINEMAS,1303 Drama Film and Television,Spectrality in Pa negre/Black Bread (Villaronga 2010): Queer aesthetics and its politics of memory,"Since the 1960s, Latin American and Iberian filmmakers have embraced the child’s gaze as a cinematic tool to mediate and understand the historical and political memory of war and dictatorial violence. During the transitions to democracy in the 1990s and the twenty-first century, cinematic representations of children became key in the cultural politics of memory. Pa negre/Black Bread () is one of the films that problematize the past. Through its queer aesthetics, the film depicts a vision of the war and the dictatorship that rejects dogmatic, formulaic readings and shows how the pervasive effects of political injustice nurture social and gender violence. Villaronga’s film challenges the spectators and their expectations by questioning who the real monsters are and how lies fabricate a particular vision of history and the demonization of the other. In this article, I argue that through the spectres of the past, and the monsters in the present, Pa negre evokes a moral and aesthetic complexity that resists the politics of consensus and avoids essentialist views on queer identity, the Catalan resistance to the Francoist state and the treatment of the past as a mere ideological commodity in the contemporary politics of memory in Spain.","[{""name"": ""Cecilia Enjuto Rangel"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368008 University of Oregon""]}]","[""10.3828/bhs.2014.38"", ""10.1353/mln.2016.0018"", ""10.3828/bhs.2016.63"", ""10.1080/14682737.2015.1125101"", ""10.1080/10509208309361157"", ""10.1215/03335372-2006-016"", ""10.1002/9781118322765.ch8"", ""10.1002/9781118322765.ch1"", ""10.1080/14636204.2014.972118"", ""10.1002/9781118557556.ch11"", ""10.1386/slac_00058_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

10.1017/S0307883320000048,THEATRE RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,1303 Drama Film and Television,"South Pacific Brownface: Racial Imposture, Global Markets, and National Theatre inTapu(1903)","New Zealand critics and audiences in 1903 hailed Tapu (by Alfred Hill and Arthur Adams) as the harbinger of a new ‘national drama’. They thought that the comic opera captured the national essence and would broadcast the nation's advantages to a global audience. Yet the production never made it beyond Sydney, and has since disappeared from the historical record. My analysis of the script and critical reception shows that Tapu faltered in its confused adoption of a wide array of techniques of racial mimicry (borrowed from metropolitan theatres) to represent indigenous Māori and white visitors, but not the native-born settler population. The story of Tapu's failure, I argue, reveals something about the transnational conditions for the constitution of a national public sphere, and the indispensability of race as a supplement to that nation. It attunes us to the force of performance genre and repertoire as vehicles of racial information and affect, pointing to the ways in which conformity, rather than invention, was the ticket to success in the emergent global culture industries. If popular performance, and specifically racial mimicry, operated as a public experiment with the racial properties of citizenship – as a generation of scholarship on race and performance has argued – to what extent was that experiment controlled by the conventions of the global commodity market? This essay reaches insights that will be of interest to scholars of (trans)national performance history, settler whiteness and global indigeneity, and is germane to disciplinary debates on minstrelsy, ethnological show business, and cultural appropriation.","[{""name"": ""MARGARET WERRY"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5749/minnesota/9780816666058.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

More specifically, the essay advocates for recentring Global South contexts—in this case South Africa—in a ‘food studies’ conversation that has often been dominated by the American academy; it also underscores the vitality of the humanities, qualitative social sciences, and creative arts for transcending reductive ‘food security’ paradigms often applied in the Global South. The essay first examines the short story “Water No Get Enemy” by South African writer Fred Khumalo, introducing how a focus on food and eating can illuminate globalisation, xenophobia, resource conflict, and environmental change. From here, the authors introduce the evolving field of ‘food studies,’ then outline the eight academic, personal, and creative pieces that constitute this special issue, all authored by contributors from the African continent. Issues raised include the gendered and queer politics of food, breastmilk, and soil; the ongoing coloniality of neoliberal approaches to food inequality; the burdening of Black bodies; the role of so-called ‘ethnic restaurants’ in building transnational and multi-ethnic communities; and the heightened stakes of food access during the COVID-19 pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Ben Jamieson Stanley"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Delaware Newark, DE USA""]}, {""name"": ""Desiree Lewis"", ""affiliation"": [""University of the Western Cape Cape Town South Africa""]}, {""name"": ""Lynn Mafofo"", ""affiliation"": [""University of the Western Cape Cape Town South Africa""]}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Cultural Studies', 'Geography, Planning and Development', 'Food Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)]]"

Choreographed in collaboration with a composer and social scientists, Let Down is a duet for two lactating women who dance alongside a digitally transposed and augmented soundscape of sonic aspects of maternal experience, and improvise to the live sounds produced by infants in the audience. The work responds to a ‘quietening’ of maternal corporeality in some Western societies through a feminist dramaturgy of sonic disruption that refigures intermedial relations between sound and movement in performance to make unheard experience sensible. Attending to the complex sociopolitical and affective terrain that informed the work's creation, I discuss how a methodology of ‘quietening’ developed during the choreographic process generated space for a dialogue between private and public spheres of experience. I propose that the methodological concept of quietening offers both an alternative approach to choreographies of affect, and a critical framework for questioning representations of socially ‘quietened’ corporealities.","[{""name"": ""AOIFE MCGRATH"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article discusses how this social experience was presented in radio reportages, for which silence is not only a topic but also an element of the construction of the message. The reports of the Polish Radio, produced in lockdown conditions, document silence in a double perspective: the transformation of the broadcast sphere of large metropolises and the private sound space of the characters. Silence, as a phonic phenomenon, functions as a universal metaphor for fear, threat, “curse of isolation,” but also hope. Experiencing silence goes beyond the individual feeling thanks to a metaphoric line through which the recorded stories gain a universal context. The analysis of audible materials shows the mechanism of the constitution of these meanings, as well as selected media functions of silence as a tool for modelling content and managing the recipients’ attention.","[{""name"": ""Aneta Wójciszyn-Wasil"", ""affiliation"": [""The John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin ( Poland )""]}]","[""10.1080/20551940.2021.1875291"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11sn6t9.4"", ""10.18778/1505-9057.39.06"", ""10.5040/9781501382802"", ""10.1386/rjao.14.1.23_1"", ""10.4324/9781315744049"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195388947.001.0001"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2020.1745666"", ""10.15290/pss.2018.34.12"", ""10.5040/9781501306839"", ""10.5040/9781501335402"", ""10.18290/rkult.2019.10.4-4"", ""10.4467/22996362PZ.19.004.10218"", ""10.26913/avant.2020.03.33"", ""10.5040/9798216955412"", ""10.47191/ijcsrr/V5-i8-12""]",['Social Sciences'],['Communication'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Most of his video installations are based on concepts borrowed from the field of mathematics, physics or information technology. In this paper I will examine Ikeda’s audiovisual installations by presenting these multimedial installations as possible methods of visualizing digital data in the context of contemporary art. Considering their digital and abstract nature, these works can also be analysed as unique audiovisual environments built from different media based on the same data-sets, offering the possibility of immersion. By unfolding the medial relations within Ikeda’s work I will try to demonstrate how the combination of sight and sound creates the inter-sensual experience of getting in touch with digital data.","[{""name"": ""Mihály Lakatos"", ""affiliation"": [""Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania ( Cluj-Napoca , Romania )""]}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv36xvpkc"", ""10.1162/014892600559489"", ""10.5040/9781501308307"", ""10.2307/1771942"", ""10.4324/9780203309049_chapter_12"", ""10.1162/002409401300052523"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9358.001.0001""]","['Computer Science', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Computer Science Applications', 'Information Systems', 'History and Philosophy of Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

With works that celebrate the material world in its myriad forms and scales, from a beloved button to a bottomless sea, Agnès Varda developed a method of empathetic engagement. Her encounters grasped relations extending from a person, family, or group, to a greater world-memory and duration comprising “us” all. As it heeds these foldings of the world, this article considers subjectification processes that take into a self all elements of nature. With sustained awareness of the “hundreds of thousands of people” she doesn't know, through her acts of listening and portraiture, in her later years Varda simultaneously attained a recognizable persona and an imperceptibility that gestured to an inward-outward movement her works so often foretell: that of a self's full dissolution into memory and world. In line with Varda's lifelong commitment to new forms of making visible the invisible, and her embrace of a sea as a groundless source of intersubjective relations, limits transform via her works into reflective, dissolving surfaces. A doubling of the personal and cosmic—that movement that so singularizes Varda—emanates through this weave of her art and life. As a chiasmatic double herself whose encounters brought extremes into contact, Varda demonstrated a concern for the future of the world that persisted alongside an awareness of her own mortality. Beyond the duration of her own life, Varda's works expose us to ourselves while always foregrounding the woman, and women, behind, before, and beyond the lens.","[{""name"": ""Nadine Boljkovac"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

Village Wooing shares several themes with Pygmalion, including a language bet and a contentious relationship between a working-class young woman and a gentleman who corrects her diction. Like Pygmalion, it explores several important language ideas. John Bertolini calls it “a play of reading and writing,” and Peter Gahan describes it as “an encounter between writer and reader.” I have used Walter Ong’s provocative “The Author’s Audience Is Always a Fiction” to examine the complex relationship between an author and a reader in Village Wooing.","[{""name"": ""Jean Reynolds"", ""affiliation"": [""Polk State College""]}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

For seventy years the Gallery has enjoyed the fruits of his enduring success. This is based upon his writings, the multiple performances of his plays, and in particular the success of My Fair Lady. In his will he assigned one-third of his royalties to the Gallery after his death in 1950. The other part is split evenly between RADA and the British Museum in the United Kingdom. This year is, of course, also a year to lament. The period of copyright lapses and no more royalties will come our way. Even sadder, for the first time ever there were no payments this summer, as the pandemic closed theaters across the world.

Fintan O'Toole in his recent book, Judging Shaw, likened the way Shaw conducted his “world-bettering” to a man on a high wire without a net. This article discusses the risky way Shaw conducted himself on this “high wire,” focusing on his promotion of a new science-based religion called “Creative Evolution,” which he adapted from Henri Bergson's version of it to a semireligious approach that presented “Creative Evolution” as an evolution from and “bettering” of Christianity.","[{""name"": ""Richard Farr Dietrich"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

Bozorg Alavi, a founding member of Iran's leading communist party, first introduced Iranian readers to Shaw through his translation of Mrs. Warren's Profession (1928). Since then, Shaw has appeared as a recurring point of reference for intellectuals with leftist sympathies in Iran in their pursuits of a range of reform agendas. This article focuses specifically on the mid-twentieth century, a politically turbulent time in which much of the resistance movements that led to the 1979 revolution emerged. It uses translations, criticisms, and productions of Shaw's work in addition to original analyses of Shaw's plays in dialogue with Iranian literature and politics to analyze Shaw's presence in debates surrounding issues of gender, national identity, and political freedom.","[{""name"": ""Soudabeh Ananisarab"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Once merely denotative, it used to refer to everything Shaw related. Progressively, it came to be used to qualify those works and ideas that were typically Shaw's, that is, the idiosyncratically “Shavian” stuff. The purpose of this article is to situate the meaning of the word “Shavian” and to trace the evolution of its meaning in later years, especially as the arrival of new media made it possible for this word to colonize other domains. In order to do so, a corpus-based analysis of the most common collocates for “Shavian” has been utilized to map the recurring binomials that shape the meaning of the term. Later, this article looks into specific uses of the term that, for different reasons, have come to be used (1) in a sense that is alien to what is usually covered by Shaw studies and/or (2) in new media of the digital age. This part allows us to gain insights into the semantic transformation of “Shavian” after Shaw.","[{""name"": ""José Luis Oncins-Martínez"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Medicine']","['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

10.3138/md-66-1-1251,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Shattering Normalcy: Disability and Queerness in Tennessee Williams's One Arm,"In addition to his extensive body of dramatic work, Tennessee Williams also wrote several screenplays that are inseparable from his oeuvre in terms of both content and form. His plays and screenplays – which Williams himself referred to as “film plays,” indicating their hybridity – are sites where the playwright explores aesthetic possibilities that blur the line between stage and screen. Exploring similar themes, such as the oppression and suffering of women, disabled people, and queer individuals, Williams’s film plays also demonstrate his desire for new aesthetic formulations. This article analyses Tennessee Williams’s unfilmed film play One Arm (published in 1984) as a major but neglected moment in his dramatic exploration of disability and the non-normative body. As in his other writing, Williams shows in One Arm that heteronormative and ableist norms can push individuals to the edges of society by stigmatizing and pathologizing their identities. By depicting their social and cultural transgressions, Williams celebrates allegedly excessive and deviant behaviour as well as “abnormal” bodies. The article further argues that in One Arm, Williams calls attention to the importance of creating a sense of community among disabled and queer subjects for a livable crip/queer future, and he calls for allyship among these communities to overcome oppression.","[{""name"": ""Duygu Beste Başer Özcan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3138/md.34.4.528"", ""10.1215/00382876-88-1-161"", ""10.2307/3208486"", ""10.14325/mississippi/9781604739886.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9781403979148"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139924603"", ""10.1353/lm.2014.0012""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

The aims of the article were to reconstruct the evolution of female representations over time, to detect the persistence of gender displays in women’s portrayals and to ascertain the existence, in the 2000s, of the visual regime of confident appearing. To achieve these aims, a longitudinal quantitative and qualitative content analysis was carried out on 1963 ads and 2568 male and female models. The research found an evolution of women’s images over time, the decline of some traditional genderisms and a resexualization of the female portrayals in the 2000s, interlaced with the confident-appearing visual regime. What emerged was a new gender display – a sexualized confidence – that does not eliminate gender differences or their structure of power but concentrates them in portraits of assertive and narcissistic women.","[{""name"": ""Paola Panarese"", ""affiliation"": [""Sapienza University of Rome""]}]","[""10.1108/02651330710741811"", ""10.1177/002224377601300207"", ""10.1177/147035720200100205"", ""10.1080/14680777.2017.1300830"", ""10.1177/1367549415585555"", ""10.1007/s11747-009-0181-x"", ""10.1080/00913367.1990.10673179"", ""10.1177/1367549407075898"", ""10.1177/0959353507084950"", ""10.1080/14680777.2016.1193293"", ""10.1177/1367549417733003"", ""10.1080/08164649.2016.1148001"", ""10.1080/09589236.2012.681184"", ""10.2501/IJA-30-5-867-888"", ""10.1080/14680770600990002"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-47765-1_2"", ""10.1080/14680777.2011.537037"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2011.08.006"", ""10.1080/00224545.1975.9923340"", ""10.1080/14680777.2011.647963"", ""10.1080/09589236.2014.913977"", ""10.1177/002224298605000202"", ""10.1177/107769909907600102"", ""10.1080/09502386.2013.857361"", ""10.1080/10253866.1998.9670315"", ""10.1017/S1537592709992842"", ""10.1080/00913367.1986.10673018"", ""10.35360/njes.234"", ""10.1108/03090569510100696"", ""10.2501/JAR-43-1-111-130"", ""10.1386/jicms_00178_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Gender Studies', 'Museology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"
10.1386/jptv_00076_1,JOURNAL OF POPULAR TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,Serial communities: The dynamics between individual and collective identity in Orange Is the New Black,"The influence of soap operas on other forms of television narrative has long been remarked upon by television scholars, especially with regards to the increasing tendency towards serialized plotlines that contemporary dramas have exhibited over the last three decades. Nonetheless, the full impact of the soap opera form on the structural principles of ongoing television narratives is yet to be explored. A crucial part of this lineage is the privileged role granted to communities in soaps, a narrative strategy that has been embraced by an array of other types of serialized programming, including ‘premium’ dramas. Drawing on Christine Geraghty’s writing on soap operas’ construction of community, this article will examine how this storytelling strategy is reworked by contemporary ‘premium’ programmes. Using Orange Is the New Black () as a case study, I will explore how the patterns of interplay between the individual and the group can shape both the form and diegesis of a programme. I will analyse how Orange Is the New Black gradually shifts from being structured around a single protagonist to being structured around the community as a whole, demonstrating that the tension between individual and collective identities can be a productive force that proliferates and expands the narrative of a programme.","[{""name"": ""Kristina Graour"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000010177134X Cape Peninsula University of Technology""]}]","[""10.2307/1212060"", ""10.1353/vlt.2006.0033"", ""10.1386/jptv_00076_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Communication', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

A theater-based commons that adopts a planetary and relational approach to selfhood, interaction, and future survival on Planet Earth tends to focus on breaking with social, political, economic, and aesthetic hierarchies. I will first introduce how notions of relationality have been integrated in theorizations of solidarity, humanitarian action, and a commons. Then, I will discuss these theorizations within the contexts of theater as communication and action that involves both theater-makers and audience members as actants. Finally, I intend to show how these conceptualizations can be meaningfully applied to unraveling the artistic strategies of a broad array of plays associated with the biannual theater festival Climate Change Theatre Action, which has been taking place before and after the United Nations Conference of the Parties climate conferences since 2015. The examples from the corpus of 250 five-minute plays are to illustrate the intervention of climate-change theater in potentially insurgent commons-based engagement and thinking which tries to avoid virtue signaling and other self-promoting forms of supposed solidarity.","[{""name"": ""Nassim Winnie Balestrini"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Graz , Graz , Austria""]}]","[""10.4324/9780203067352"", ""10.1632/pmla.2012.127.3.558"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5930.003.0016"", ""10.1515/9783110579253-012"", ""10.1080/10584600590933160"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1220nq6"", ""10.2307/j.ctv3znz1s"", ""10.1177/1461444809341444"", ""10.1126/science.162.3859.1243"", ""10.1080/13569783.2016.1264264"", ""10.1525/9780520932708"", ""10.1215/-53-4-283"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316423936"", ""10.5334/ijc.987""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In this conceptual article, the author explores the ways in which online drama therapy utilizes aesthetic distance and dramatic reality. The author theorizes how these concepts translate into an online space without breaking the relationship between therapist and client/group that is already being hindered by the literal distance, the lack of body involvement and the mediation of technology and the screen. Through discussion of the existing literature on aesthetic distance and fantastic/dramatic reality, the author examines these concepts through the lens of the online setting, providing some thoughts that might be of use when planning an online session.","[{""name"": ""Maria Schubert"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121550800 National and Kapodistrian University of Athens""]}]","[""10.1386/dtr_00013_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00042_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00043_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00055_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00044_1"", ""10.1016/0197-4556(91)90068-L"", ""10.1386/dtr_00040_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00036_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00037_1"", ""10.1016/0197-4556(83)90006-0"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2006.03.001"", ""10.1386/dtr.4.2.183_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00046_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00016_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00012_2"", ""10.1037/h0085960"", ""10.1386/dtr_00051_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00025_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00108_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Conservation', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Applied Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7573), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7417)]]"
10.1353/tj.2023.a922220,THEATRE JOURNAL,1303 Drama Film and Television,Seeking Critical Frameworks for Global Majority Theatre,"Abstract: The essay advocates for expanding theater studies publications to more effectively engage with global majority epistemologies as core methodologies for analyzing theatrical phenomena. Academic theatre classes often incorporate performance studies paradigms, but most theater programs remain centered around practice-based exercises for acting, directing, designing, and producing Eurocentric theater. Global majority ways of telling stories are either not taught to students or are integrated into curricula in carefully measured doses as alternative approaches to art-making. This essay encourages twenty-first century scholars to more astutely respond to cultural productions based upon vernacular and indigenous ways of theatrical storytelling, arguing that a significant step would be to incorporate more indigenous languages, and perhaps have the journal publish in multiple languages (with translation) to expand the readership. However, even foregrounding text-based performance may be limiting. Many of the aesthetics that underly arts production in global majority cultures are constituted outside of text-based paradigms; they use symbol, myth, sound, gesture, dance language, and music as poetic containers for delivering their messages. They also build from local epistemologies connected to spirituality, religion, or alternative beliefs about the rationale and intention of performance. This essay calls for more time and space devoted to critical analysis of theatre created and performed outside of standard theatre venues, as well as a more nuanced discussion of complex ecosystems that support artistic innovation.","[{""name"": ""Anita Gonzalez"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

This disruption of the narrative is explored as a strategy that urges the viewer to consider cyclical processes by which displaced social anxieties are mapped onto different marginalized groups to form a shifting locus of backlash following moments of progressive social change in Cuban history. The article tracks the ways in which the film evokes Abakuá mythology to create historical parallels for the viewer to discover. Utilizing doubled characters and parallel journeys as its analogical grammar, tensions between the film’s archetypal figures signal larger conflicts around the policing of acceptable expressions of gender and sexuality, and the social and political processes by which particular expressions of masculinity that are perceived as ‘dangerous’ or threatening are regulated in Cuban society at different historical moments. Even though Santa y Andrés is set in 1983, the film’s contentious reception in 2016 makes it what I am calling a historically ambivalent film about repression both in the past and in the present.","[{""name"": ""Ruth Goldberg"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000094089050 SUNY Empire State College""]}]","[""10.1146/annurev.an.19.100190.001003"", ""10.2979/AFT.1999.46.2.116"", ""10.1386/slac_00029_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.3366/jobs.2023.0391,JOURNAL OF BECKETT STUDIES,0502 Foreign Language and Literature; 1303 Drama Film and Television,Seeing Barbara Bray: Marek Kcdzierski on Barbara Bray-Barbara Bray on Samuel Beckett,"Seeing Barbara Bray was written as a sketch for a portrait of Barbara Bray, who met Samuel Beckett shortly after he sent the text of All That Fall to BBC's Third Programme. As script editor and producer, she consulted with the author on his first radio drama and collaborated on subsequent works broadcast by the BBC. From the early 1960s, Bray, based in Paris, worked mainly as a literary translator. Over time a strong bond between them developed and an intimate relationship ensued. Erudite and with a gift for rendering complex issues in the least complicated way, Bray provided Beckett with much more than translating advice, encouraging him in his writing, editing his texts, and acting as his “sounding board”. Very modest and discrete, she kept a low profile until her death in 2010. It was only with the publication of the two last volumes of The Letters of Samuel Beckett (2014, 2016 respectively), that her role in his life and writing became apparent to the general readership. In his personal account, Marek Kedzierski focuses principally on Beckett's letters to Bray, her comments on them, and on her unfinished memoir from which he quotes several passages. Drawing from conversations with her recorded by him in 2003-2009, his essay ends with Bray's personal confession revealing to us her deep pain and her refusal to be “the invisible woman” in Samuel Beckett's life.","[{""name"": ""Marek Kędzierski"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/18757405-03101012""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

In the wake of globalization and Generation X, the novel 101 Reykjavík () suggested a sex-obsessed slacker identity that most Icelanders rejected or ignored. A later film adaptation (Kormákur, 2000) cut the sharpest edges off the story’s postmodern critique, lessened the protagonist’s immorality, made the narrative more conventional and offered an ending with communal reunification. The film’s success led Icelanders to revaluate not only the novel’s message but their own identity. 101 Reykjavík became the new truth about young Icelanders in the 1990s. This combination of a disputatious novel and a more conciliatory film adaptation is not uncommon with Nordic fiction. For socially ambitious filmmakers, retelling contentious stories in a form more fit for mass consumption can help them bring audiences and nations from old truths to new.","[{""name"": ""Mads Larsen"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000096326718 University of California, Los Angeles""]}]","[""10.1080/03468750903134699"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apn016"", ""10.1057/9780230251175_10"", ""10.1386/jsca_00012_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

ChatGPT is not autonomous and cannot produce creative work like humans can.

10.1386/josc_00143_1,JOURNAL OF SCREENWRITING,1303 Drama Film and Television,Scripted resonance or lost in translation? Storytelling and Chinese reception of Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This study delves into the intricate art of screenwriting by critically examining the reception of the 2023 award-winning film, Everything Everywhere All at Once, among Chinese audiences. Notwithstanding its international laurels, Everything has sparked a divided sentiment in Mainland China. While its audacious blend of genres and the poignant depiction of Chinese–American experiences have been recognized, Everything was absent from Chinese theatres, owing to its explicit content. However, its digital footprint on Chinese streaming platforms has painted a picture of ambivalence. Many Chinese viewers expressed reservations about the screenwriters’ frequent use of pop culture references, perceived narrative clichés and the incorporation of elements that seem discordant with conventional Chinese storytelling. Yet, interspersed among these critiques is admiration for its visual brilliance and inclusivity. Grounded in resonance theory, this study scrutinizes Everything, particularly the screenplay’s reliance on the oft-touted ‘universal’ blueprint of the Hero’s Journey. Aligning with critiques suggesting such frameworks might be culturally myopic, this study connects these screenwriting choices to the lukewarm reception among Chinese audiences. Through this lens, the study offers invaluable insights for screenwriters keen on crafting narratives that resonate deeply with Chinese viewers. Moreover, it adds to the larger conversation about the need for diversifying screenwriting templates on the global stage, challenging the dominance of western-centric paradigms such as the Hero’s Journey.

10.1093/adaptation/apaa031,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Screening Social Justice: Performing Reparative Shakespeare against Vocal Disability,"Abstract Many screen and stage adaptations of the classics are informed by a philosophical investment in literature’s reparative merit, a preconceived notion that performing the canon can make one a better person. Inspirational narratives, in particular, have instrumentalized the canon to serve socially reparative purposes. Social recuperation of disabled figures loom large in adaptation, and many reparative adaptations tap into a curative quality of Shakespearean texts. When Shakespeare’s phrases or texts are quoted, even in fragments, they serve as an index of intelligence of the speaker. Governing the disability narrative is the trope about Shakespeare’s therapeutic value. There are two strands of recuperative adaptations. The first is informed by the assumption that the dramatic situations exemplify moral universals. The second strand consists of adaptations that problematize heteronormativity and psychological universals in liberal humanist visions of the canon. This approach is self-conscious of deeply contextual meanings of the canon. As a result, it lends itself to the genres of parody, metatheatre, and metacinema. Through case studies of Tom Hooper’s King’s Speech, Cheah Chee Kong’s Chicken Rice War, and other adaptations that thematize vocal disorders, this article identifies a common trope in reparative performances of disability in order to highlight some questions the trope raises.","[{""name"": ""Alexa Alice Joubin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, George Washington University""]}]","[""10.1017/9781108785716"", ""10.2307/j.ctt17kk9p8"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139629201"", ""10.1177/030802260707000303"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199283262.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9781137356000_14"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474455589.003.0001"", ""10.1075/ssol.4.1.04koo"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674061200"", ""10.1057/9781403973665"", ""10.1080/10510974.2013.832691"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1bj4s55""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Anthropology', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

In the context of screen production research, the short film serves as a result of the research; therefore, it must perform the research findings. The article will centre on one of the author’s doctoral work, which the co-author is currently supervising, a new and critically acclaimed queer short film entitled Expulsion. Through an examination of Gaffney’s short film, which centres on a fictional queer state, the authors will reveal a selection of short filmmaking techniques, such as the use of historical retellings, environmental thematic connections, as well as other textual methods, which can be used to challenge the current popular formula for LGBTQ+ characters and narratives, which unfortunately tend towards the neo-liberal and homonormative.","[{""name"": ""Victoria McCollum"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000105519715 Ulster University""]}, {""name"": ""Kevin Gaffney"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000105519715 Ulster University""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-62837-0_4"", ""10.1177/1329878X0611800113"", ""10.1080/10894160.2014.849162"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-62837-0_2"", ""10.1080/14790726.2016.1142571"", ""10.5406/jfilmvideo.68.1.0019"", ""10.1386/sfs_00059_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

In order to quantify these, it proposes a working definition of ‘Scottishness’ based on representational content. This generates a body of 21 Scottish Plays for Today, which the article further breaks down into two sub-sets: seven plays produced outside Scotland and fourteen within. Noting that the externally produced plays are far better remembered and much more easily accessible than their locally produced peers, the article asks: do the external plays alone offer a reliable synecdoche for the terms of Scotland's contribution to Play for Today and the images and understandings of Scotland that Play for Today created and/or confirmed? Through extended comparative textual analysis of two externally produced plays – Just Another Saturday and The Elephants’ Graveyard – and two locally produced ones – Degree of Uncertainty and The Good Time Girls – the article demonstrates that the answer to this question is in the negative. The analyses presented here highlight the extent to which the 1970s work of writer Peter McDougall is far more formally and tonally complex than its contemporary popular and critical reputations might suggest. They also highlight the existence of an extended engagement with feminist gender politics and identities within Scottish screen fiction from an earlier date than conventionally identified within the established scholarly consensus. In these ways, the article addresses multiple aspects of Scottish screen and cultural studies’ long-term neglect of television's position and significance within modern Scottish culture and cultural history.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan Murray"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9780748631827-008"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2013.0132"", ""10.1515/9780748633937"", ""10.3726/978-3-0353-0183-0"", ""10.5040/9780755697281"", ""10.3366/scot.2018.0246"", ""10.1515/9780748631827-013""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It implied the making of a series of cultural films about the peoples and cultures of the USSR and, therefore, involved the search for scientific grounds for advancing cinematic art. In the second half of the 1920s, some Soviet filmmakers even worked out specific methods, based on real scientific research, which could be applied in the field of documentary. For example, one of the key trends in the theory and methodology of Soviet cinema in the 1920s–1930s was the study of the audience’s perception through decoding—with the help of psychology (reflexology)—of the recorded mimic reactions of viewers. We have analyzed the method of “parallel filming” of the audience, which was introduced by the Soviet film director and ethnographer Anatoly Terskoy within the scientific, cinematic, and ideological contexts. We believe that this overlooked concept is a valuable material for today’s documentary filmmakers. On the one hand, Terskoy’s works highlight the creative paradigms in which cinematographers were making their ethnographic and anti-religious films in the Soviet Union of the 1920s and 1930s. On the other hand, it was such scientific and creative searches that later became the theoretical basis for large-scale projects on the cinematic representation of different parts of the USSR on screen.","[{""name"": ""ELENA V.

A more nuanced understanding of the impact of theatre practice in marginal contexts is constructed from narrative analysis of the theatre workshop experiences of adolescents in a rights reparation program and men serving long prison sentences. In these contexts of double exclusion (poverty combined with the condition of being prisoners and homeless or violated adolescents), the participants’ long-term remembrances make constant reference to the theatre experience having signified a transit from one space or place to another. The theatre space was identified as a place of discovery, a place of validation and a place of relocation. Their theatre experience drew meaning from its implicit contrast to their everyday reality. It was a place they decided to make their own, because within it they truly experienced feelings of wellbeing not present in the marginal spaces they were inhabiting.","[{""name"": ""Iria Retuerto"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121540610 Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano, Santiago, Chile""]}, {""name"": ""Penelope Glass"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121540610 Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano, Santiago, Chile""]}, {""name"": ""Estefanía Guzmán"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121540610 Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano, Santiago, Chile""]}, {""name"": ""Teresita Dumas"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121540610 Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano, Santiago, Chile""]}, {""name"": ""Andrea Formantel"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121540610 Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano, Santiago, Chile""]}, {""name"": ""Fernanda Pozo"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121540610 Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano, Santiago, Chile""]}]","[""10.1080/13569783.2017.1293510"", ""10.1080/13569780903072125"", ""10.3102/0013189X019005002"", ""10.1080/13569783.2016.1263556"", ""10.1080/13569780408540600"", ""10.1111/j.0435-3684.2000.00076.x"", ""10.1162/1054204041667659"", ""10.1353/jae.2005.0047"", ""10.1080/13632752.2017.1287348"", ""10.1386/atr_00038_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Conservation', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Initially, the Nigerian government was reluctant to put measures in place or lock its borders until a returnee was diagnosed after he had infected some people. This necessitated several measures including total lockdown, social distancing and improved personal hygiene to forestall its spread. Moreover, Nigerians believe that the state of the nation is even worse than this pandemic and, thus, have developed mastery, especially via satire in weathering any kind of storm. It is therefore, not surprising that the Facebook has become a veritable platform where Nigerians evoke humour while exposing human foibles in their linguistic disposition, with the intention to improve the society. This study, therefore, examined the satirical devices in the Facebook posts of Nigerians with the aim of teasing out the ideologies portrayed in relation to the existing social, economic and political attitude of the people towards the pandemic. Consequently, 22 Facebook posts were purposively selected for analysis, drawing input from Horatian’s approach to satire and sociocultural approach to Critical Discourse Analysis. The analysis reveals various satirical elements deployed as a subtle and effective alternative to contest power abuse, social injustice and propagate change. The study also reveals the wittiness and absurdity of satire that makes it a ready tool to unbridle people’s feelings; laden with different ideologies with the aim of relaxing tension and catalysing transformation in the society. Moreover, the import of weathering the storm becomes bare as an essential make-up of Nigerians; the tinge of humour intended in the posts relieves perceived tension and reminds the readers to take life easy, thus, making the study quite engaging.","[{""name"": ""Chioma Deborah Onwubiko"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000095184324 Federal University of Technology""]}]","[""10.1163/2031356X-02701004"", ""10.2979/RAL.2001.32.1.1"", ""10.1386/jams_00077_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Language and Linguistics', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"
10.1093/adaptation/apad037,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Sarah Polley's take on the Me Too moment: adapting Women talking to the big screen,"Abstract This article discusses Sarah Polley’s 2022 film adaptation of Miriam Toews’ novel Women Talking (2018), inspired by a case of mass rapes in a Mennonite colony in Bolivia, as part of the Me Too moment; a new zeitgeist that has modified the conditions of reception for survivor testimony. We examine it as an audiovisual product that amplifies the resonance of the original text and contributes to the current wave of feminist testimonial practices about sexual violence, constituting an instance of narrative activism that promotes social change. Through our analysis of the dynamics of storytelling in the film, we prove that Polley’s cinematic strategies place emphasis on the women’s lived experiences and points of view, distilling the words of the book to capture the key elements of their discussion (forgiveness, justice, obedience, trauma, and structural violence) and, rarely but significantly, deviating from the original text to achieve her goal of female-centred focalisation. While scholars and survivors have described the battle over the narrative in rape cases, Polley does not leave room for it. In line with #MeToo, the movie takes an ethical listening stand, presenting female testimony as valid evidence. The question at stake is not whether the protagonists have been raped by the men of the colony, but what they are going to do about it; and, by extension, what the viewers are going to make of their story as told by themselves.","[{""name"": ""Marta Fernández-Morales"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oviedo , Spain""]}, {""name"": ""María Isabel Menéndez-Ménendez"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Burgos , Spain""]}]","[""10.1386/ejpc_00029_1"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apab020"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-28243-1"", ""10.1080/17400300802098313"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apz022"", ""10.1215/10407391-14-3-89"", ""10.1386/ejac_00061_1"", ""10.1007/s10892-021-09383-1"", ""10.7312/gilm19420"", ""10.7312/gilm17714"", ""10.1080/07351690.2022.2121150"", ""10.1353/frm.2012.0009"", ""10.1093/litthe/fraa020"", ""10.1177/2056305120984447"", ""10.7764/cdi.47.1908"", ""10.1093/screen/16.3.6"", ""10.1080/17400309.2017.1377937"", ""10.59136/lv.2023.1.1.101"", ""10.1515/9781772840117"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-97322-7_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98669-2"", ""10.1080/17400309.2022.2132072""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Identifying elements of subversion and subjectivity allows scholarship on the LWT series to be reassessed, recognising occasions where it challenges rather than supports the social structures of the depicted Edwardian past. The BBC series also incorporates the post-heritage element of self-consciousness, acknowledging the parallel between its narrative and the production's attempts to recreate the success of its 1970s predecessor. The article's first section assesses the critical history of the LWT series, identifying areas that are open to further study or revised readings. The second section analyses the serialised war narrative of the fourth series of LWT's Upstairs, Downstairs, revealing its exploration of female identity across multiple episodes and challenging the notion that the series became more male and upstairs dominated as it progressed. The third section considers the BBC series' revised concept, identifying the shifts in its main characters' positions in society that allow the series' narrative to question the past it evokes.

The article concludes by suggesting that the barriers to recreating the past established in the BBC series' narrative also contributed to its failure to match the success of its earlier iteration.","[{""name"": ""Will Stanford Abbiss"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9781137467898"", ""10.1057/9781137265920"", ""10.2307/1354140"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748633890.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781474290661"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198182931.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781628928327.ch-003"", ""10.1215/02705346-11-1_31-26"", ""10.1057/9781137283948""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The article looks into the activist ways in which the explorers interacted with Russian, Swedish, and Finnish archives in order to both reveal and make accessible cross-border materials and knowledge pertaining to Robenne. To explore the relationship between the Robenne materials, the archival institutions, and the group of collaborating historians, the authors draw on Caswell and Cifor’s notion of “radical empathy”. The article thus brings new archival theory into the performing arts domain and makes a dance contribution to the broader field of critical archival and heritage studies. To cross borders to account for Robenne’s Russian legacy counters previous historiography’s disinterest in following the careers of non-canonized migrating artists in the Nordic-Baltic region.","[{""name"": ""Astrid Von Rosen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eugenia Klimova"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olga Nikolaeva"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Music']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

My argument involves close readings of portions of the texts associated with the physical set and the emotional connections among the characters through the lens of queer theory. I first trace the lineage of the families and set designs that define this subcategory of drama, highlighting the relationship between physical form and cultural content. I contend that the household sets that accompany the canonical works of family drama have created a parallel between the structures we see on stage in these plays and the kinds of (normative) families we expect to encounter inside. Citing these predecessors in both the visual and emotional landscape of her plays, Ruhl in her works then tears both the physical houses and normative boundaries of families asunder.

Characters in the series read and recite Blake, Clare, Keats, Shelley, and Wordsworth; comment on the nature of poetry; and make emotional connections through poetic affinities. Simultaneously, the structure of the series is gradually revealed to the audience as a pattern of doublings and couplings, of mirrors and parallels—all of which can be associated with the poetic device of rhyme. Rhyming shapes the sensory and cognitive experiences of the audience of the series; it also reflects the order of the diegetic universe, be it a freakish correspondence of incongruous things or God’s plan. Since these aesthetic choices seem to be part of the creator’s highly self-conscious design, the series becomes an adaptation of Romantic poetry, not only directly using the historical Romantic texts, but re-enacting in its organization the epistemological practice that rhyme is for English poetry.","[{""name"": ""Nina Farizova"", ""affiliation"": [""East Asian Languages and Literatures, Yale University""]}]","[""10.1093/adaptation/apt019"", ""10.3366/rom.2017.0318"", ""10.4324/9780203356623_chapter_1"", ""10.1515/9781400866908"", ""10.1177/1749602018796698"", ""10.7227/CST.8.1.3"", ""10.1017/S1060150318000992"", ""10.13110/framework.59.1.0032"", ""10.1386/seci.6.2-3.165/1"", ""10.4324/9780203847640"", ""10.1080/10350330408629682"", ""10.3366/rom.2017.0319"", ""10.3366/vic.2016.0211"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64559-9"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199337026.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9780691196671"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apu022""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

10.1386/slac_00031_1,STUDIES IN SPANISH & LATIN AMERICAN CINEMAS,1303 Drama Film and Television,Revolutionary ruralities: Spaces of surveillance and exclusion in Carlos Lechuga's Santa y Andres (2016),"The abundance of rural and provincial settings as spaces belonging to or determined by revolutionary time are recurrent elements in Cuban cinema prior to 1989. Many documentaries and films from the late 1960–80s focused on ‘scaping’revolutionary accomplishments and struggles in the construction of a socialist society. At that time, the depiction of provincial and rural towns of Cuba were aligned with and echoed the Revolution’s political and social agenda of collective work, struggle and revolutionary virtue. This article explores rural space, surveillance and exclusions through Carlos Lechuga’s film Santa y Andrés (). The film portrays the punishment and surveillance of a blacklisted homosexual writer in a small town in the eastern part of the island during 1983. This article, first, examines how Santa y Andrés questions the premise that Cuba’s rural and provincial space is a homogeneous revolutionary one, and, second, proposes that the film’s choice of location refashions the rural-provincial space in Cuban cinema as a space of dissidence, exclusionary practices and pervasive surveillance.","[{""name"": ""Lauren Peña"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000104627212 University of Texas at Austin""]}]","[""10.1353/cj.2014.0016"", ""10.1386/slac_00031_1""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

West's Before It Hits Home,"This article recuperates Cheryl L. West’s domestic drama Before It Hits Home (1991) as a milestone in HIV/AIDS drama. Home is the first full-length play to examine the destructive impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the African American community and one of the first HIV/AIDS plays written by an African American woman. Before It Hits Home has not received the scholarly recognition it deserves; this article aims to rectify that neglect with the help of Black studies and queer theory. In particular, the article undertakes an in-depth examination of the play’s overlooked spatio-temporal possibilities, demonstrating that West’s use of juxtapositions and overlaps offers an alternative to white and heteronormative spatio-temporalities. I argue that West’s liberating reconstruction of time and space not only queers white spectatorship but also resists a predominantly white HIV/AIDS canon. Building on Frantz Fanon’s notion of disalienation, I further conclude that West’s theatre destigmatizes the seropositive diagnosis, allowing for emancipatory possibilities.","[{""name"": ""Çağdaş Duman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/9780822373711-013"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226190518.001.0001"", ""10.1215/10642684-3-4-437"", ""10.1215/9780822373711-017"", ""10.1023/A:1025031330977"", ""10.7312/zama18740""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

Obioma’s adaptation of parable revises this narrative form as radically relational. This revision of parable is tied to an equally relational understanding of adaptive processes. Using parable as the frame for its complex mixture of Igbo and Yoruba mythology, Biblical stories, and Greek and Roman myth, among others, enables the novel to reinterpret all these sources in the context of postcolonial Nigeria. This process thereby challenges the belief that we can dispel colonial power structures by simply rejecting canonical stories and their discursive frameworks and it suggests, instead, a notion of identity as relational and transient. Ultimately, the novel proposes an ethics of relationality that can help to re-assess processes of revision and their political and cultural impact.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Heinz"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English and American Studies, University of Vienna""]}]","[""10.1353/sdn.2018.0013"", ""10.2304/pfie.2010.8.3.408"", ""10.1353/esc.2007.0074"", ""10.1080/13688799890174"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-05743-5"", ""10.3998/mpub.10257"", ""10.2307/j.ctt211qwk5"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.1353/utq.2011.0152"", ""10.1353/crt.2004.0001"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apm005"", ""10.1515/9783110272239.1"", ""10.1080/09528829008576262"", ""10.2307/j.ctvndv9xr"", ""10.1515/9783110272239.230""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The history of research into soap opera fans (the genre from which teen drama series derive) tells us that this is unsurprising, as women’s popular pleasures have long been denigrated. Gaining global popularity in the mid-2000s, teen drama fandoms have almost exclusively played out on social media, and this article asks how fans’ experiences of their ‘guilty pleasures’ might have changed in a social media age. The article argues that two things remain unchanged: (1) the stubbornness of gendered and classed assumptions about ‘acceptable’ forms of culture and (2) the policing of behaviour within fandoms. But a noteworthy change lies in the norms themselves; that is, laborious and emotional fan practices are now more valuable than ‘likes’ and other social media metrics, a shift that undoes decades-old understandings of acceptable attachments to popular cultures.","[{""name"": ""Ysabel Gerrard"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369262 University of Sheffield""]}]","[""10.1177/1527476407307241"", ""10.1177/1461444812472322"", ""10.1080/14680770802217311"", ""10.1177/0196859916666041"", ""10.1177/0270467610385893"", ""10.1093/screen/hjw019"", ""10.1177/1527476413487607"", ""10.1177/1367549407084961"", ""10.1080/15295036.2012.755053"", ""10.1177/016344392014001002"", ""10.7227/CST.8.1.4"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9227-5"", ""10.1386/jptv_00078_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Taking a theoretical perspective provided by the field of intellectual inquiry known as cultural techniques ( Kulturtechniken), the door in these films is studied with respect to its procedural and functional operations. Specifically, the article focuses on the ways in which the employment of doors in each of the films relates to these films' configurations of inside and outside as conceptual realms. The analysis presented shows that Lubitsch and Chaplin engage doors in uniquely different ways. It further reveals that, while the operation of the door in When I Was Dead reinforces an exclusive binary of inside and outside, which itself can be traced back to the film's concern with sexual difference, the operation of the door in The Adventurer essentially deconstructs the inside/outside binary, an act that can be linked to a critique of contemporary notions of industrial management and the treatment of humans as machines.","[{""name"": ""Ido Lewit"", ""affiliation"": [""Tel Aviv University""]}]","[""10.1057/9781137010841"", ""10.1080/10509208.2016.1192908"", ""10.1111/j.0020-2754.1999.00175.x"", ""10.1177/0263276413488962"", ""10.1080/17460654.2010.498161"", ""10.2307/1428938"", ""10.1080/10509208.2015.1094335"", ""10.3167/9781845450748"", ""10.2307/j.ctt14jxrmf.16"", ""10.1177/0263276413500828""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cultural Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1093/adaptation/apz010,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Resurrecting 'Lucifer': The Transmedia Mythology of Harry Lime,"AbstractThis essay examines the transmedia mythology of the popular but also ‘evil’ character, Harry Lime, who, in The Third Man (1949) written by Graham Greene and directed by Carol Reed, is shot dead in the sewers of postwar Vienna. The romance of Lime begins with a famous ‘Wellesian’ performance, with Orson Welles drawing on a tradition of Shakespearean ‘heroic-acting’, and Reed’s alteration of Greene’s ‘happy’ closure that effectively underscores Hannah Schmidt’s hero-worshipping of a cult criminal figure. Both creative interventions established the platform for Lime’s ‘resurrection’ in the radio series, The Lives of Harry Lime (1951–52), the television series, The Third Man (1959–65), and Orson Welles’ film, Mr. Arkadin (1955). I argue that the moral rehabilitation of Greene’s fallen figure is indicative of postwar conformist entertainment industry and folk nostalgia for the wartime black marketeer as well as the differing ‘moral codes’ operating across transmedia platforms. But, whereas the radio and TV serializations conscript Lime into the detective-agent genre by burying the evil results of his penicillin racket, Mr. Arkadin de-romanticizes Lime and in turn exposes the cultural amnesia of the 1950s by returning to the 1949 film’s morality and Faustian image of a sadistic racketeer. Written in the spirit of Hans Blumenberg’s theory of myth-adaptation as ongoing ‘points of departure’, this essay debates the ethical issues at stake in this character-oriented misappropriation whereby the protagonist’s moral status is transformed across media platforms.","[{""name"": ""Scott Freer"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Leicester""]}]","[""10.1017/S0307883300019349"", ""10.1080/02666286.1997.10434295"", ""10.1386/rjao.8.2.105_1"", ""10.1353/book.3302"", ""10.4324/9780203642139"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748635276.001.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520940710"", ""10.5040/9780755604401"", ""10.1057/9780230250871""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

My initial research into the twenty-first century biopics has uncovered problematic representations of women who are child-free, including the dehumanizing portrayal of actor Marilyn Monroe in the 2022 feature Blonde or the love-fixated writer Jane Austen in the 2007 biopic Becoming Jane or the pronatalist depiction of intrepid foreign correspondent Marie Colvin in . While theorists are aware of the negative representations of child-free women in film and television, there is very little research on depictions of these women in the twenty-first century biopic, presenting an opportunity for a concentrated study that can bring theory to screenwriting practice. Where the extant literature points to problematic representations of child-free women, it does not go further to suggest possible solutions, in this case, in more nuanced film and television representations.

10.1017/S0266464X20000640,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,Representing the Unrepresentable in South Korean Activist Performances,"On 16 April 2014, the Sewol Ferry capsized in the southern region of South Korea: 304 passengers died, including 250 high school students. Despite an international outcry, there has not yet been a comprehensive investigation into what caused the Sewol to sink and why the passengers were not rescued promptly. This article discusses how performance can represent something that defies explanation because we do not know how or why it happened. Yellow Ribbon’s Talent Show, Namsan Arts Centre’s From Pluto, and Camino de Ansan performed the role of the students who died. Taking these three case studies, this article analyzes the ways in which they strive to represent the unrepresentable as they attempt to document the sinking and achieve justice, while memorializing the victims and arguing for the necessity of a more safety-conscious society. Areum Jeong is Assistant Professor in Humanities at Sichuan University-Pittsburgh Institute. Jeong’s research takes a transnational approach to Korean and Korean-American film, literature, theatre, and performance. Her current book project explores how performance documents death, loss, and memory in South Korean and diasporic communities.","[{""name"": ""Areum Jeong"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Cultural Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

The work is of an overview nature, it notes the methods of giving photographs the features of originality, which emerged at different stages during the century-long history of artistic photography. Earlier studies never focused on the fact that photographers were constantly artificially limiting the technical reproducibility of their works. Addressing this issue defines the novelty of this work. Such a limitation was demanded by an approach in which photographic images had been evaluated from the perspective of traditional art, which affected not only determination of their aesthetic value, but also the legal aspect. And yet, at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the presence of machine nature in photography became a stumbling block in the development of legislative norms on the copyright for pictorialists. The entry of photography into the art market environment gave it the obligation to limit the number of copies based on commercial considerations. The relevance of the study lies in the issues of replicability in digital art, its acquisition and sale. I attempt to interpret the phenomenon of the blockchain system as a concept influencing new ways of understanding and evaluating digital photography in light of its history. The emergence of the NFT format is considered as a moment of overcoming the attitude towards the replicability of artistic photography as a problem rather than its natural property. A suggestion is made that the emergence of a virtual artistic environment has the potential to harmonize this long-standing conflict, and also raises the question of the need for new legal norms in this area.","[{""name"": ""ALEXANDRA L.

The first event, In Loving Memory, staged a mock memorial service for lost lands and culture and took place as part of the National Day of Action against Muskrat Falls in June 2018. The second event occurred at the closing ceremonies of the Muskrat Falls Symposium, held in September 2018 at Memorial University of Newfoundland. At these events, the collective experience of melancholia for that which has been lost as a result of Western energy culture foregrounded and enacted the intimacy needed for decolonial love. Taken together, the events shed light on the way relations between settlers and multiple Indigenous groups in Make Muskrat Right resist the settler fantasy of reconciliation, focusing instead on recognition, healing, and renewal through attunement and responsiveness to difference.","[{""name"": ""Olivia Heaney"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctt1hfr0s3.6"", ""10.5749/j.ctt1pwt77c""]","['Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Health', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'General Health Professions']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Complicating the issue, Swedish television ties in with radio as a domestic medium, making the conceptual links between television and cinema seem less obvious. If we write a history of media characterized by replacement, we tend to overlook how new and old media exist simultaneously in everyday life. Our article investigates how television features in memory narratives of cinema in the context of quotidian life in the late 1950s and 1960s in Sweden. The study draws on memories collected through 60 oral history interviews in two large-scale projects. With a focus on cultural practices and Lisa Gitelman’s concept of ‘associated protocols’ in media use, we ask how cinema and television are conceived in relation to each other in hindsight when remembering television as new.","[{""name"": ""Jono Van Belle"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107388966 Örebro University""]}, {""name"": ""Åsa Jernudd"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107388966 Örebro University""]}]","[""10.1177/1367549415609327"", ""10.2979/his.2003.15.2.5"", ""10.1023/A:1021620224085""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

Both the journal and society are now defunct. The history, as recounted by longtime Vice President Sally Peters, is followed by three articles using her writing as examples of published pieces, presented chronologically as they appeared in the last six years of the journal. The first was an immediate response to Peter Tompkins and his claim concerning his mother, Molly Tompkins, and Shaw. The second was drawn from Eric Bentley’s personal correspondence with Thornton Wilder, concerning both Brecht and Shaw, the latter negatively viewed by Wilder. The third piece—literally the final piece ever to be published in The Independent Shavian—circles back as Shaw mourns William Archer, learns the tango, and describes his experience of the dance to Molly Tompkins.","[{""name"": ""Sally Peters"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Medicine']","['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

10.1093/adaptation/apad018,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Reimagining the Past to Construct the Future: Nostalgia and Netflix's She-Ra,"Abstract Netflix’s She-Ra (2018) is an example of how nostalgia-based children’s culture uses speculative fiction to reimagine the past while commenting on the present. The new She-Ra papers over shortcomings in the original show, rewriting adults’ memories of the character. She-Ra, and shows like it, allow adults to experience nostalgia for childhood media and toys by rewriting potentially unpleasant aspects of these thirty-year-old narratives. Though She-Ra uses characters and imagery familiar to parents, the show changes fundamental elements of the original to reflect contemporary social justice concerns, using its science-fiction elements to access political commentary including environmental degradation and coalition building. I will read the television show alongside recently released merchandise which depicts both the new and the 1985 versions of the character. Accessing the new and original versions of the character allows parents to both connect to contemporary children’s programming and reimagine their own childhoods through a contemporary social justice lens. As major producers of children’s culture such as Disney and Netflix embrace the nostalgia trend, scholars should pay careful attention to how these remakes as well as their marketing campaigns treat the source material. Even if the updated films and television shows are more self-aware, nostalgia-based marketing may allow adults to uncritically embrace and endorse the original content of works created in the 1980s that treat issues of race, gender, and sexuality in ways that are inconsistent with current cultural norms. She-Ra and the Princesses of Power argues against this embrace of nostalgic forms, even while using nostalgia to draw in a millennial audience.","[{""name"": ""Sara Austin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, Kentucky Wesleyan College , Owensboro, KY , USA""]}]","[""10.5406/amerjpsyc.126.3.0355"", ""10.1386/jfs.7.2.93_1"", ""10.1386/jptv_00058_1"", ""10.1386/qsmpc.2.2.161_2"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2k4fwq8.4"", ""10.1080/01956051.2022.2051419"", ""10.1353/uni.2021.0024"", ""10.5040/9780755697786"", ""10.1037/a0027236""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Gender Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

RI is a compound methodology that considers four levels of interpretation. First, it asks researchers to consider how they handle empirical material. Second, it encourages researchers to analyse how they make their acts of interpretation conscious to themselves and their reader(s). Third, it calls for reflection on how sociopolitical and ideological contexts shape the research endeavour.

The first surge of interest in Soviet film comedy came in the first half of the 1990s and was largely associated with the fall of the Iron Curtain. The major subject of research during those years were Soviet avant-garde cinema of the 1920s, musical comedies of the 1930s, and films of the Perestroika period. The second wave came in the 2010s with the emigration of a large number of Russian scholars who had personally witnessed the Soviet Union. Thanks to them, the range of the studied material has significantly expanded through the analysis of film comedies of the 1960s and 1970s. The main thematic directions and topics in the study of the comedy genre are structured in accordance with the history of film timeline. Soviet comedies of the 1920s–1930s are of specific interest to foreign researchers in terms of the ideological regulation of art, as well as in terms of how the mythology of the new socialist society was formed, and how Soviet filmmakers adapted or rejected Western standards. In the comedies of the 1960s and 1970s, scholars analyze the discordance between declared and unspoken humor and study the Aesopian language of famous comedy film directors (Ryazanov and Gaidai above all). Finally, in late-Soviet films, researchers note the growth of absurdist motifs as a sign of a complete and no longer hidden disillusionment with communist ideals.","[{""name"": ""DARIA A.

Orlov at the height of the Great Reforms,"Prince Nikolay Alexeyevich Orlov (1827–1885) was an aristocrat, a war hero and a prominent diplomat of the Russian Empire who enjoyed a prestigious position from a very young age. In his correspondence with Grand Duke Nicholas Alexandrovich in the early 1860s, Prince Orlov expounded his views on Russian politics, putting forward his liberal outlook of what the empire ought to be. His most crucial proposals were (i) revising Russian foreign policy and redefining imperial borders (which included solving the ‘Polish Question’); (ii) adopting federalism with local representative institutions based on a notion of ‘legitimate power’; (iii) introducing bottom-up reforms; (iv) abolishing ‘backwards practices’ (in particular, corporal punishment) and (v) guaranteeing civil rights and equality before the law. Based on letters and other writings that remain vastly under-researched in Russia and practically unknown to English-speaking audiences, I analyse Prince Orlov’s correspondence as illustrative of a broader ideological turn to liberal imperialism and contextualise it from Russian and European perspectives. By positing that Russian liberalism was strongly impacted by the successes and shortcomings of the liberal imperialism of the 1860s, I invite the reader to rethink some ideological and chronological boundaries that are routinely taken for granted in discussions regarding liberalism, imperialism and their interconnectedness.","[{""name"": ""Sara de Athouguia Filipe"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut Forum Suisse des Migrations, University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland""]}]","[""10.7591/9781501747762"", ""10.1080/07075332.2017.1350873"", ""10.1057/9780230118928"", ""10.1515/9781400834709"", ""10.1093/jcs/csp066"", ""10.2307/j.ctt2272686"", ""10.1080/01916599.2020.1746083"", ""10.4159/9780674969346"", ""10.1177/0090591705279609"", ""10.1515/9781400884919"", ""10.1057/9781137366924"", ""10.2307/j.ctv10kmg72"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-22272-8"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511618734.013"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226519180.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230512238"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.051508.214538"", ""10.1353/kri.2015.0003"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2012.00548.x"", ""10.1057/9781137019974_4"", ""10.1017/S0034670506000246""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The nature of the show’s interaction with Soviet culture is traced through five parameters: the geography of the participants, the repertoire, the figure of one of the mentors, voice timbres, and specifics of interpretation. The Voice, like the all Union song festivals of the Soviet era, strives for geographical pervasiveness and maximum ethnic diversity within the project. This diversity, however, turns out to be very conditional. It does not imply musical immersion into different cultures, but is limited to a linguistic, and, at most, arranging reworking of the titular nation’s culture. Among the Soviet pop music themes, in the highest demand in the show are dramatic love ballads, songs about nature, and compositions about the artist’s fate. Alexander Gradsky, being one of the mentors, gave newly found relevance to the half-forgotten hits of the Soviet time, creating a new image of the Soviet music stage, far from sterile piety and emotional restraint. The analysis of participants’ timbres and the peculiarities of their vocal technique shows that The Voice brings back the fashion for trained, powerful and velvety voices of the Soviet estrada. Another trait noticed was the two vectors of the performing interpretation of Soviet pop songs. Most of the contestants tend to become completely identical, indistinguishable from the original (canonical) version of the song, while only few dare to radically rethink the Soviet-time songs, striving to show their originality and uniqueness by significantly changing the well-known music.","[{""name"": ""DARIA A.

That is, products of cinema and cinematic practices shaped the process of colonialism in the specific case of Africa. Predicated largely on archival documents, this study explores how cinema was regulated in the major towns and cities in the Gold Coast during the colonial era. Ghanaian cinema has a considerably long historical narrative, however, much of what is known about the history of cinema in Ghana, particularly, on film screening, censorship and exhibition practices, is rather little. Thus, it is with this gap that this study attempts to fill and make a useful contribution to Ghanaian film history. The colonial experience set the basis for cinematic houses, film production, censorship, distribution and ideological concerns in African cinema. This study is framed within the relationship between cinema and history, with a specific focus on Ghana. This article concludes that while film exhibition, censorship and licensing stimulated the growth of art, particularly cinema, they further inflated the colonial imperial agenda in the Gold Coast.","[{""name"": ""Augustine Danso"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123228567 University of Cape Coast Ghana""]}]","[""10.3366/E135499010900046X"", ""10.1017/S0021853700017400""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The novella contemplates collective memory, generational trauma, and identity issues. This article compares the song and novella, discusses how both song and novella express historical issues of slavery and contemporary issues of environmental destruction, traces diverse inspirational source materials, and examines the novella’s depictions of negotiation and reconciliation between individual versus communal identities within a context of generational trauma. This article argues that, with wajinru representing a bridging of humanity and nature, and with complex thematic interplay between forgetting, remembrance, and healing, the novella constitutes an Afrofuturist, magical realist, counternarrative challenge to dominant historical narratives, and illuminates the importance of reconnecting communal memory to individual identity-construction for recovering from generational trauma, and of building a more utopian world through cultivating love that transcends species and gender. In addition, this article analyzes how Solomon’s novella and its diverse source materials highlight the palimpsestic and intertextual nature of artistic adaptations and encourage audiences to engage in egalitarian, boundary-defying cultural production, and innovative blurring of genres, media, and authorship.","[{""name"": ""Longyan Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, School of Foreign Studies, Nanjing Forestry University , Nanjing , China""]}]","[""10.1093/adaptation/apn015"", ""10.5040/9798216024910"", ""10.1521/psyc.64.3.256.18464"", ""10.1111/hith.10817"", ""10.1353/crt.2004.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-39835-4_3"", ""10.5406/illinois/9780252040559.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195107968.003.0004"", ""10.2307/j.ctv260719g"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66041-7""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

This article utilises genre studies, conflict studies and trauma theory in analysing how the representations of film villains interact with the construction of cultural trauma and national identity. Considering the American action thriller to be an important site for processes of commemoration and memorialisation, the discursive construction and formal articulation of national trauma are theorised within the genre. Additionally, a thematic and textual analysis was conducted of a sample of forty American action thriller films. The analysis illustrates how the genre operates through a structure of violent traumatisation and heroic vindication, offering a logic built on the necessity and legitimacy of revenge against a series of enemy-others.","[{""name"": ""Lennart Soberon"", ""affiliation"": [""Ghent University""]}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Philosophy', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

Throughout the research, I take a critical stance that seeks to uplift voices of an audience attending a radio listening club (RLC) and therefore utilize participatory methods to co-create the body of knowledge with study participants. In this article, I query RLC audience’s thoughts of the project’s relevance and influence in their daily lives. Oriented by Hall’s concepts of encoding and decoding, I analyse my data focusing on the dynamics between the objectives of the producers and the lived reality of the participants. Findings reveal that audience’s motivation for continued attendance of the RLC is different to that intended in the encoding process; rather audiences negotiate the relevance of messages to their own needs, those of their children and utilize the space to extend their social capital.","[{""name"": ""Mtisunge Isabel Kamlongera"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000091514445 Oslo Metropolitan University""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-14625-2_15"", ""10.1086/268844"", ""10.1080/01463370500270355"", ""10.1207/s15327027hc2003_2"", ""10.1080/13569783.2020.1791695"", ""10.1386/jams.11.2.143_1"", ""10.17159/2221-4070/2017/v6i1a3"", ""10.1177/160940691101000201"", ""10.1111/jcom.12332"", ""10.1177/097325861000400304"", ""10.1080/01292980500467657"", ""10.1177/1043986202018002005"", ""10.1177/002205748716900303"", ""10.1177/097325860500100101"", ""10.1177/0957926517725979"", ""10.2979/globalsouth.8.1.7"", ""10.1386/jams_00080_1""]",['Social Sciences'],['Communication'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1515/jcde-2020-0010,JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY DRAMA IN ENGLISH,1303 Drama Film and Television,Radical Gesture and the Politics of Postdramatic Tragedy: Reza Abdoh's The Law of Remains,"AbstractDuring his short lifetime, Reza Abdoh (1963–1995) was hailed as a trailblazing theater artist in the avant-garde art scenes of both Los Angeles and New York, where he created a series of massive performance spectacles that sought to intervene critically in the American political status quo. His 1992 piece The Law of Remains stages a furious response to the US American AIDS crisis, depicting it through the allegorical lens of a film being made by Andy Warhol based on the life of queer serial killer and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer. Performed in the ruins of an abandoned hotel ballroom, the piece drew attention in The New York Times for being “one of the angriest theater pieces ever hurled at a New York audience.” This article analyzes the political dimension of Abdoh’s theater by focusing on specific gestural elements that occur at key moments in The Law of Remains. Doing so, it brings together theories of gesture from Hans-Thies Lehmann, Giorgio Agamben, Judith Butler, and Walter Benjamin, and configures these viewpoints into a constellation through which the politics of gesture in Abdoh can be illuminated. What emerges in Abdoh is a politics of “hopeless hope,” one uniquely meaningful for our planetary present tense.","[{""name"": ""Joseph Cermatori"", ""affiliation"": [""Skidmore College, New YorkUnited States of America""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Bernstein had been a fixture in Rodman’s life since the 1950s, when Rodman’s father served as a “front” for Bernstein’s television work. Bernstein would later use that experience as inspiration for The Front (dir. Martin Ritt, 1977), his trenchant and mordantly funny account of life on the blacklist. Rodman surveys Bernstein’s long career, from his years as a journalist for the US Army publication Yank and The New Yorker, to his post-blacklist work of the 1960s and 1970s, to his work at the Sundance Screenwriting Lab, where he and Rodman both served as advisors, closing the circle.","[{""name"": ""Howard A.

The authors reflect on the historical and contemporary implications of music, including music in alternative and experimental spaces, and how traditional spaces are often inaccessible to racialized and/or marginalized musicians. Within this landscape, the authors examine how RADAR works to disrupt Eurocentric conventions of music and performance while responding to Canada’s role in the perpetuation of violence against Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit peoples. In addition, Dénommé-Welch and Magowan share their collaborative process and articulate their rationales for RADAR’s structure and unconventional soundscape. Finally, the authors reflect on the rehearsal process leading up to the premiere of RADAR and how intercultural, decolonizing approaches are important strategies for engaging with musicians and making space for more inclusive artistic practices.","[{""name"": ""Spy Dénommé-Welch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Catherine Magowan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9780889776579-004""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Music'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

However, where Miller writes through an optimistic lens, Williams does the opposite. The two plays address the difficulties of relationships—both platonic and romantic—regarding hope and despair. However, the perspectives of each of their protagonists, who are both named Quentin, process their lives and futures in contrasting ideologies. As Miller's Quentin seeks a new beginning, he must first process his past, which revolves around the women in his life. Williams's Quentin grapples with the reality of being gay in a homophobic society. The importance of each playwright choosing the name Quentin and the meaning of the name, “the fifth,” includes the religious connotations of the number five. Miller and Williams use their plays to explore their futures, with each breaking the fourth wall, like a confessional.","[{""name"": ""Elle Shannon"", ""affiliation"": [""Rhode Island College""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1386/ac_00065_1,ASIAN CINEMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Queer voice(over): Reassembling female desire in Chinese cinema,"This article discusses Chinese director Ning Ying’s 2006 film wuqiongdong (Perpetual Motion) with an emphasis on the development of queer voice(over) – a queer feminist aesthetic achievement that subverts and perverts the heteropatriarchal suppression of women’s desire. Specifically, I analyse the ways queer figure’s voice-over interacts with haptic visuality, contemporaneous image and the intertextual references between film-texts and exterior texts about the film. I argue, through queer voice(over), Perpetual Motion expands its theme beyond the issue of infidelity in a heterosexual marriage, develops a cinematic critique to the twentieth-century Chinese feminist movements and articulates female desires from multiple registers of senses, psychology and historical subjectivity. In Chinese cinema where queer voices are usually marginalized, Ning’s queer voice(over) establishes a mutually referent relation between queer and heteronormative storylines, thus circumventing the state censorship and adding queerness into Chinese-language feminist debates and cinematic expression.","[{""name"": ""Xuefei Ma"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123151184 University of Tennessee, Knoxville""]}]","[""10.1386/jcca.6.1.77_1"", ""10.3898/newf.68.05.2009"", ""10.1086/679610"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1360.2010.01070.x"", ""10.1386/jcc.5.3.253_1"", ""10.1386/ac_00065_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1386/jac_00118_1,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN CINEMAS,1303 Drama Film and Television,Queer cultures and African cinema: Deliberations on patronage and vulnerabilities,"This article analyses selected documentaries about queer experiences in Uganda and Nigeria. It focuses on counter-discourses on Africa’s heterosexual normativity, advancing three perspectives. The first concerns globalization and rapid cultural exchanges enabled by various forms of mobility, which bring cultures into contact, promoting interferences. The documentaries analysed here reveal that queer African cinema and the identities it brings to light reflect the continent’s long history of interaction with the rest of the world and the exchanges therein. The second focuses on the evangelical efforts towards the politics of queerness, which also align with the legislation of sexuality in Uganda. Thirdly, the article demonstrates how the media sometimes perpetrates the vulnerability of queer identities, as represented in cinema. The debates around queer sexualities that these documentaries raise interrogate religious patronage and public antipathies towards queer identities in Africa. The article concludes that the pro-queer documentary films discussed play advocacy roles, opening new fronts for resistance against oppressive experiences.","[{""name"": ""Wesley Paul Macheso"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121132211 University of Malawi and ISNI: 000000012214904X Stellenbosch University""]}]","[""10.1080/17450100500489189"", ""10.1080/14680777.2015.1008535"", ""10.1177/2050303214552571"", ""10.1353/mwr.2015.0005"", ""10.1080/23277408.2021.1894056"", ""10.1007/s11133-016-9342-7"", ""10.1080/713674315"", ""10.1080/10130950.2015.1024917"", ""10.1017/asr.2013.40"", ""10.1080/00918369.2012.638549""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

During that interim, Shaw and his French translator Augustin Hamon exchanged countless cross-Channel letters and debated how to translate the play and adapt it to a foreign sociocultural milieu. “Pygmalion has never failed,” Shaw boasted to him in 1919. Yet despite their combined efforts at fine-tuning the play to suit the French temperament, it did. While Hamon blamed the Théâtre des Arts manager and what he called a “cabal” of French critics, Shaw blamed Pauline Pax (Eliza), the “tomfoolery and vulgarity” of the production (photos of which he found “appalling”), and “the cretinous imbecile who produced the play.” “If theatrical people persist in regarding the play as a love affair between Higgins and Eliza,” he told Hamon, “they deserve all they get in the way of failure.”","[{""name"": ""Michel Pharand"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Scholar""]}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

Early theories of phonetics and elocution used the speech of educated Londoners as a standard reference point. Then, two technologies—new phonetic writing (from Melville Bell and Henry Sweet) and Edison’s phonograph—enabled the recording of the full variety of spoken English. Shaw exhibits the intersection of these technologies in Pygmalion, displaying their contrary powers. On the one hand, they allowed a new precision in understanding the nuances of global English. On the other, they created new ways of linking colonial and imperial power to standardized speech. In his later career, Shaw worked with the BBC to create a new sense of a “narrow band” of standard speakers, expanding beyond London but still conveying a standard model for global imitation. The article considers Eliza’s and then postcolonial resistance to that standardization.","[{""name"": ""Carolyn Jacobson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erik Simpson"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"
10.3138/ctr.190.003,CANADIAN THEATRE REVIEW,1303 Drama Film and Television,Pursuing Universal Accessibility for Everyone: The Linguistic Experience at Partition/Ensemble Conference,"Universal accessibility (or design) is a trend that promotes accessibility for everyone in various ways. One of its attributes is to ensure that everyone has equal learning opportunities, especially with the ‘access to information’ format. This applies to arranging a conference that includes conference organizers, plenary speakers, performers, conference presenters, and audio describers preparing to provide information and sensorial accessibility to the conference participants. Unfortunately for contemporary conferences, individuals with different needs are likely to experience language barriers due to their linguistic differences, hearing loss, and/or challenges in understanding and/or accessing visual information. A performing arts conference, Partition/Ensemble 2020, hosted by the Canadian Association of Theatre Research, serves as a case study for examining the process of arranging and providing language interpreters and text transcriptions, including audiovisual descriptions. During the COVID pandemic in the summer of 2020, the conference organizers decided to have a relaxed virtual conference. This designation had an impact on the preparation with four languages in different modalities: English (spoken and written), French (spoken and written), American Sign Language (signed), and Langue des signes québécoise (signed). From this linguistic learning experience, individuals who participated in this conference (e.g. conference organizers, plenary speakers, and audio describers) share their thoughts and insights for the implementation of an accessible conference (whether hosted in-person or online) with the goal of reducing language barriers. The authors of this article consider what it means to incorporate a diversity of languages simultaneously with different modalities and the challenges of accessibility with this endeavour.","[{""name"": ""Jody H.

Either adapted from folk literature/theatre and historical texts or based on original ideas by the screenwriters/directors, purba films are set in the pre-colonial era, invariably in a kampong and glorify the Malay world prior to the arrival of the imperialists. I argue that the genre, which encompasses diverse variants and subdivisions, has undergone several phases of transformation and evolution, in particular, while drawing out the genre’s codes, conventions and ideologies. Additionally, I demonstrate that they are, on the one hand, culturally and cinematically specific, and, on the other, are borrowed from, and shaped by, other cinematic genres, forms and practices.

10.1386/josc_00161_1,JOURNAL OF SCREENWRITING,1303 Drama Film and Television,Procession: The role of screenwriting and filmmaking in the healing process of survivors,"This article discusses the therapeutic potential of scriptwriting in healing trauma behind and in front of the screen. It focuses on the documentary Procession (Greene 2021) that gives voice to six middle-aged male survivors of child abuse by Catholic priests. The documentary shows film director, Robert Greene, and the dramatherapist, Monica Phinney, leading a journey of continually supporting and encouraging survivors to re-tell their stories. Rather than focusing on direct interviews, Procession invites survivors to re-enact their memories, creating an opportunity for them to not only revisit but also to recover from their personal traumas. As they share their stories, they engage in a collective act of screenwriting, taking turns acting in each other’s scenes. The documentary shows the complex process of screenwriting to overcome child abuse and trauma, as each survivor creates and shoots a key scene from their personal history of abuse. Throughout the documentary, survivors play the roles of screenwriters, film directors and actors, leading their scenes, bringing traumatic dialogues back to life, recalling nightmares and revisiting physical sites of abuse. This article draws upon Bill Nichols’s and Jill Godmilow’s analytical framework of performance-based documentary to analyse how Procession uses scriptwriting and filmmaking as tools for participants to unpack their feelings, generating space for a cathartic reconciliation with their past.","[{""name"": ""Aline Frey"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000449020432 University of New South Wales""]}]","[""10.1386/josc.8.1.55_1"", ""10.1080/14790726.2017.1373825"", ""10.1080/10714421.2010.505145"", ""10.1093/applin/amaa002"", ""10.1177/0040563921995848"", ""10.1386/fict_00049_1"", ""10.1093/screen/42.2.188"", ""10.1177/1748895818781199"", ""10.1177/0022167807301787"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-57310-2_10""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Conservation', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

The sample consisted of seventeen preservice primary school teachers (thirteen women and four men) from the Department of Classroom Education of the Faculty of Education of a public university in Türkiye. Data were collected using drama lesson plans, practice lesson diaries, semi-structured interview questions and metaphors. The data were analysed using inductive content analysis. The results showed that participants held misconceptions regarding drama lesson methods and techniques in their lesson plans. Participants had difficulty managing their classrooms while implementing their plans and they did not fully understand dramatization. Moreover, their classrooms were too crowded for drama activities. Participants stated that drama made the lessons more fun. They noted that drama helped them develop creativity and interact with their classmates. They also added that drama made them feel free. They regarded drama as a method or technique that could be used in any course. Researchers should conduct further qualitative and quantitative studies to examine drama’s ‘discipline’ dimension and to form a basis for needs analysis for its use in education.","[{""name"": ""Ayça Kartal"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000403697341 Muş Alparslan University, Türkiye""]}, {""name"": ""Ayten Arslan"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000403697341 Muş Alparslan University, Türkiye""]}]","[""10.5539/ies.v9n10p163"", ""10.1080/14452294.2007.11649506"", ""10.29329/ijpe.2020.277.15"", ""10.1080/01626620.2018.1424657"", ""10.1080/00219266.2018.1490799"", ""10.1080/14452294.2018.1537134"", ""10.1080/1547688X.2020.1814466"", ""10.1080/13569783.2020.1816818"", ""10.1080/19415257.2018.1557240"", ""10.1080/1359866X.2019.1631254"", ""10.33206/mjss.515271"", ""10.1080/135697800114186"", ""10.1080/13569783.2021.1901567"", ""10.1080/1359866X.2018.1504279"", ""10.1080/02619768.2020.1807513"", ""10.1080/00313831.2018.1502681"", ""10.1080/03004430.2016.1207635"", ""10.19171/uefad.505629"", ""10.1080/03004430.2017.1336165"", ""10.1080/03075079.2019.1586331"", ""10.1080/1356978960010214"", ""10.4314/afrrev.v9i3.10"", ""10.1080/13569783.2012.694038"", ""10.1080/02619768.2019.1628215"", ""10.1080/02635143.2019.1605347"", ""10.29333/iji.2019.12150a"", ""10.1080/13569783.2020.1796615"", ""10.1080/13569783.2011.617099"", ""10.1080/10486800008568581"", ""10.1080/13569780902868911"", ""10.5897/ERR2018.3661"", ""10.1080/13569783.2019.1643710""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Posthumanism entails rethinking of traditional principles of performing arts; it deconstructs humanistic values and challenges rational, self-sufficient subject and linear narration. Based on Karen Barad’s concept of intra-actions and the philosophical theory of New Materialism, the article analyzes such strategies in contemporary theatrical practice as the creation of stage assemblage bodies, the return of the “thing-power,” and the procedurality of actions and relationships. The directors stage non-linear, continuously unfolding and evolving events occurring between the various materials within the stage space, objects, actors, dancers, musicians, light, sound, text, etc., all masterfully equalized. The examples of the performances of Heiner Goebbels, Tadeusz Kantor, Kris Verdonck, and Kristina Zvykova help to study the spaces of distributed forces making the emphasis on the exploration of the potential, in which the human will is dispersed, relevant; however, the human presence and their ability to interact remain quite essential factors for the development and renewal of the artwork’s forms. Postdramatic theater and expanded scenography open up new possibilities for expressing the non-linearity, the dynamism of the world around, for comprehending and experiencing the involvement of human beings and non-human objects in the processes of co-construction of environments, spaces, and events.","[{""name"": ""ANTON A.

This article primarily examines the image construction of Ghana in video-films. Over the past few years, videofilms in Post-colonial Ghana have often been critiqued by film scholars and critics for reinforcing superstitious beliefs and instigating backward tendencies that derail national development. Normative scholarships have critically explored the visuality of Ghanaian video-films and their themes. Nonetheless, these normative scholarships have often overlooked the nexus between the Ghanaian society and video texts. It is against this scholarly gap that this study engages the meta-question of how video-films project Ghana in their texts. This article will engage a critical textual reading of a few popular films from the Pentecostal and Occult genres to contextualize the ideological sub-texts and the image construction of Ghana in these selected video-films.

Through a detailed case study, the analysis delves into Zhang Hong’s early childhood trauma and his sensitivity to social perceptions of disability, highlighting the importance of respecting the subject’s dignity. The article integrates insights from disability studies and trauma theory, advocating for a nuanced portrayal that transcends the ‘inspiration porn’ trope. The findings emphasize the necessity for documentary filmmakers to engage deeply with their subjects, ensuring narratives are grounded in empathy and reality. This approach enriches the documentary’s narrative and challenges traditional media representations of disability, promoting more inclusive and respectful portrayals. The study concludes that authentic representation in documentary screenwriting requires a commitment to ethical storytelling, respecting the complexities of the subject’s experiences and fostering a deeper understanding of disability and trauma among audiences.","[{""name"": ""Ruohan Tang"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369297 University of Southampton""]}]","[""10.1080/02674648766780021"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-59894-3_2"", ""10.1037/pst0000241"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-59894-3_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90332-3_15"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-59894-3_1"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-51018-1_24"", ""10.1080/09687599.2019.1566889"", ""10.1080/09687599.2016.1205473"", ""10.15441/ceem.23.009"", ""10.1177/0308022616640802"", ""10.1177/0920203X231220191"", ""10.1177/106082659700500302"", ""10.1080/08900523.2010.497025"", ""10.3138/cjfs.17.1.2"", ""10.1080/17400309.2012.693765"", ""10.1037/rep0000391"", ""10.1080/10304310903461270"", ""10.1080/09687599.2021.1994369""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Language and Linguistics', 'Safety Research', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Theoretically, our article relies on the concept of media system. Methodologically, we use text analysis to map the choices of the UPC. The period of analysis ranges from 1948 when the UPC was created to 1956 when the party was banned by the colonial authorities. The results show that the political communication strategy of the UPC mainly gave preference to letter writing to mobilize the masses. In addition, the UPC owned several newspapers to cover its activities and criticize the French colonial administration in Cameroon.","[{""name"": ""Christian Tatchou Nounkeu"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000115300805 Mid Sweden University""]}]","[""10.1353/at.2000.0027"", ""10.1080/03468755.2018.1500394"", ""10.1515/9786155211898-003"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a096513"", ""10.5958/2278-4853.2019.00153.8"", ""10.1515/9783110623628-006"", ""10.1177/135406880391002"", ""10.1057/s41269-018-0079-z"", ""10.1017/S0021853710000253"", ""10.2307/1953070"", ""10.1386/jams_00015_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S0266464X22000021,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Political Control, Administrative Simplicity, or Economies of Scale? Four Cases of the Reunification of Nationalized Theatres in Russia, Germany, Austria, and France (1918-45)","In 1917–18, the new republican governments of Russia, Germany, and Austria nationalized their former court property. A monarchic-turned-national heritage of prestigious opera and dramatic theatres weighed heavily on national and regional budgets, prompting first attempts to create centralized forms of theatre governance. In a second wave of theatre reorganization in the mid-1930s, the Soviet government created ‘union theatres’ under a Committee for Arts Affairs; the German and Austrian theatres underwent the Nazi Gleichschaltung (1933–35 and 1938); and France, a ‘democratic outlier’, opted for nationalizing the Opéra and Opéra-Comique under the Réunion des théâtres lyriques nationaux. These conglomerates have so far been little studied as historically specific forms of theatre management, particularly from a comparative, trans-regime perspective. What balance can be struck between economic, political, and ‘artistic’ costs and benefits? How does ‘Baumol’s law’ of decreasing theatre profitability apply to these very different politico-economic systems, as well as to war economies? Dictatorships reveal an economic seduction power, while this essay argues for confirming a long-term ‘great European convergence’ of state-centred theatre management, internal structure, and accountability, both in peace and war.

In contrast to current policy environments, where music educators are seen as the target of policy, we situate music educators as teacher-as-policy-maker as a guiding image for teacher preparation that need not and should not mean a distancing from practice. In this conception, music teachers are the generators of policies with others. In this chapter, we address how research in teacher-education core practices can be aligned with and facilitate learning about policy enactment in preservice music education. We demonstrate how core practices, as a pedagogical approach, identify learning how to teach as a “high leverage” practice to be developed. We end the chapter by articulating some core practices in intercultural teaching and policy that music teacher educators might implement to help preservice teachers develop, practice, and enact their own practices.","[{""name"": ""Patrick Schmidt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joseph Abramo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0022487109348479"", ""10.1177/0013161X02381002"", ""10.1177/0895904809354495"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2016.05.001"", ""10.1093/019924264X.001.0001"", ""10.3102/0002831207312906"", ""10.1080/13540600902875340"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001442"", ""10.1080/10632911003626903"", ""10.1017/S0265051715000224"", ""10.1177/0022487112473837"", ""10.4324/9780203118252"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190246143.003.0002"", ""10.1080/10632913.2011.546702"", ""10.1177/1321103X15590698"", ""10.1177/00224871093372"", ""10.1108/09578231311291422"", ""10.1177/0022487112445789""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Education', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Jerome, Alfred Hennequin, Agnes Platt, and Moses Malevinsky","Since the 1990s, there has been a large number of ‘how-to’ manuals published in English for aspiring playwrights. By and large, these texts treat the pedagogy of playwriting as a recent phenomenon. However, a series of relatively unknown books from the mid-nineteenth century were written with the purpose of teaching the craft of dramatic writing, emphasizing the importance of a hands-on understanding of the theatre and the individual roles within it. This article argues that, while these books are representative of the historical context in which they were written, they also contain advice which is still useful for playwrights, along with fascinating individual characteristics. Texts featured include one of the earliest manuals discovered, written by the anonymous ‘A Dramatist’; a text by the first (known) woman to write a how-to manual in English; and a book which uses a mathematical formula as a foundation for writing a script.

Each play illuminates the pervasive presence of petroleum infrastructures in its own way: while Spill focuses on the specific and sensational crisis of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, Oil presents a series of scenes which focus on two women (mother and daughter) who struggle to carve out their existence in various time periods and in the context of different fossil-energy regimes. Both plays succeed in unveiling not only the toxicity of extractive regimes necessary to fuel the Petrocene, but also the toxicity of the narratives that uphold extractive regimes and their attendant injustices. Moreover, both plays convey the intoxicating effects of oil, which appears as a near-magical substance that promises unfettered progress and access to the good life. Examining these plays in conjunction not only highlights the increasing presence of ecological concerns in dramatic pieces, but also illustrates the ways in which dramatic performance can distill enormous oil infrastructures into apprehensible worlds and thus create vital spaces for pondering the Petrocene.","[{""name"": ""Linda M.

It was welcomed by both the lower class, who enjoyed its focus on the daily lives of the average folks and less convention-bound performance routines, and the literati, who did not share their northern counterpart's class-based bias toward the form as lower-class entertainment. Using concepts from celebrity studies while challenging the field's Eurocentric tendencies, this essay analyzes the popular xiaobao (tabloid) media's role in making the star actress Bai Yushuang a celebrity. It then focuses on two areas of pingju 's evolution that sustained its popularity through two star actresses: Bai Yushuang's antifeudal plays with transgressive heroines created in cooperation with leftist intellectuals and Zhu Baoxia's adaptions of jingju (Beijing opera) plays that formally elevated pingju toward the supposedly more advanced genre.","[{""name"": ""Siyuan Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Focusing particularly on its engagement of Lakota performers, it argues that the Circus acted as an active negotiator of national concerns within and beyond Germany’s borders, and presented the group as ‘familiar natives’ in order to appeal to local and national ideas of Germanness. At the same time, it shows that the performers pursued their own interests in becoming international and cosmopolitan performers, thereby challenging the assimilation forced upon their traditions and culture by institutions in the United States. Finally, it demonstrates how foreign propaganda built on the Circus’s national image in Latin America to restore Germany’s international relations after the First World War. Sabine Hanke is a lecturer in Modern History at the University of Duisberg-Essen. Her research examines the German and British interwar circus.

The same years comprised the beginning of the so-called ‘golden age’ of Burmese cinema. Amidst films of various genres, historical fiction war films glorifying Burmese soldiers and peasants as heroes, and constructing archetypes of enemies to the country’s independence marked an important shift from earlier colonial-era nationalist films which had sought to reclaim Burmese sovereignty by harking back to the grandeur of prior Burmese dynasties. Instead, while war experiences are homogenized and enemies are stereotyped, national heroes were now created as part of a post-independence political milieu.","[{""name"": ""Jane M.

The resulting process, in which the museum adapts new methodologies to its toolkit, entails the introduction of participatory video. In this article, the author examines how participatory video can be used as a museum pedagogical and/or method of mediation. Through selected examples, she presents the methodology of participatory filmmaking and its adaptations in museums, analysing the project The Living Cultures: Decolonising Cultural Spaces (2020). She also presents two participatory filmmaking museum sessions in Hungary: the Participatory Filmmaking Camp of the Hungarian Jewish Museum (2015) and the MyStory pilot project of the Sopron Museum (2018).1","[{""name"": ""Krisztina Varga"", ""affiliation"": [""Eötvös Loránd University ( Budapest , Hungary )""]}]","[""10.1111/1467-8322.12003"", ""10.3138/cjfs.16.2.49"", ""10.32564/124.5""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Museology'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

The pandemic has affected international diplomatic relations as well by amplifying existing geopolitical tensions. By situating discourses of Africa and Africans within global ferments of pandemic politics, this study interrogates how Africa and its peoples were invoked in global media. Drawing from postcolonial theory and conceptual propositions of Afrophobia, the study uses multimodal discourse analysis to critically examine news stories that engaged with two phenomena: controversies regarding the African director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) and xenophobic treatment of Africans in China. Findings indicate elements of Afrophobia were evident in the Trump Administration’s and US conservative media outlets’ engagement with WHO. Additionally, the study showed the mainstreaming of non-western Afrophobia through the example of the xenophobic treatment of Africans in China. It concludes by proposing a contextual, intersectional and critical geopolitical analytical optics for a more robust understanding of the global Black experience.","[{""name"": ""Téwodros W.

Drawing upon the ideas of Oscar Wilde, along with artists such as Frida Kahlo, Francis Bacon, Gilbert and George and Jake and Dinos Chapman, it looks beyond the current attempts to reduce the question of freedom to quintessential liberal tropes. In doing so, the paper both offers a critique of the moral absolutism that’s taken over certain sectors of the so-called ‘radical left’, while demanding more political appreciation for creatives and those with the abilities to reimagine the human subject. Such a critique not only suggests the need to rethink the meaning for freedom beyond the play of libertarians, but it also calls forth a new political subjectivity who appears timely and yet timeless – the much maligned and theoretically ignored figure of the infidel, who allows us to break free from moral entrapments.","[{""name"": ""Brad Evans"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bath, Bath, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Julian Reid"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Lapland, Rovaniemi, Finland""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The case study employed to test the theoretical framework is based on Ukraine’s regional integration processes with respect to Eurasian and European regional organizations in the early 2010s. The principal research question posed is: what factors contributed to Ukraine’s decision to opt out of deeper integration with Eurasia in the early 2010s and pursue integration with the European Union insead, and how can this case study move the postfunctionalist theory forward? Three assumptions proposed by postfunctionalism, enriched with insights from social constructivism, were applied to the (dis)integration processes: salience, politicization, and collective identity.

I propose that the geopolitical notion of ‘territory’ can focus our attention on the critical situatedness of a certain type of cinema while also facilitating formal and industrial types of film analysis. The notion of territory, intended as a geographical space shaped by humans and a geographical expression of power, can be mobilized to analyse films that reveal and critique the social actualization of the material potentialities of specific places.

Through a theoretical framework constructed by the concepts of Gilles Deleuze, Gérard Genette and André Bazin, my article interrogates the Oedipal model of imitation and rebellion used to understand an act of cinematic adaptation. Analysing the links between Bernardo Bertolucci's and Stendhal's The Charterhouse of Parma (1838), I propose that cinematic adaptation may be understood as an engagement with a differential singularity; as the assemblage of a point of view in relation with another point of view. Adaptation is the creation and production of difference in concert with another difference, rather than the repetition of the same. Bertolucci's encounter with Stendhal expresses a type of historical consciousness; an expression that takes place on the planes of aesthetics and politics.","[{""name"": ""Raji Vallury"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121888502 University of New Mexico""]}]","[""10.2307/1211162"", ""10.1080/07351690701484360"", ""10.1386/jicms_00015_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

The reason for addressing the topic was the appearance of films devoted to the images of an odious personality and viewed in a new (as opposed to old films about tyrants, such as Caligula by T. Brass; Great Britain, USA, Italy, 1979) humane perspective. Such are the films about Nero (Nero, directed by P. Markus; Italy, Germany, Great Britain, France, Tunisia, 2004), Hitler (Downfall, Germany, France, Italy; directed by O. Hirschbiegel, 2004), which have already outlined a perspective in development, crowned by a film about the family of a death camp commandant (The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, directed by M. Herman; Great Britain, USA, 2008). The focus here is on the reinterpretation of the main images in the context of revealing some hidden personal features of the protagonists. For this purpose, the evil they have caused is left behind the scenes, and the viewer’s attention is focused on simple “human” emotions: Nero tearfully regrets his crimes, Hitler suffers before committing a suicide, the concentration camp commandant and his wife are horrified by the disappearance of their eight-year-old son in the death camp. By disguising the true nature of the personalities, film creators shift attention from their criminal activities to their “virtuous” everyday life not concerning the war and the military affairs. As a result, the works of art in question reinterpret the established characteristics of recognizable large-scale villains and transform them into ordinary people requiring sympathy. But, contrary to such a free interpretation of humanity, the authors of the article present a different perspective on it, where the studied phenomenon acts as a versatile-heroic one. Therefore, the aim of the article is to specify the phenomenon on the basis of two opposing matrices: 1) the development of humanistic traditions — “exceeding humanity in man” (G.-H. Gadamer), 2) distorting historical facts for the sake of artificial transformation of the representative of evil into a humane one.","[{""name"": ""GRIGORIY R.

What catches his attention concerning the renewal of Sade in France after the Second World War, I argue, is a form of literature animated by the impossible – that is, weakness, dispossession, and inoperativity –, which undermines the logic of representation at the basis of anthropocentric and humanist subjectivity. I proceed to elucidate Beckett’s translations of excerpts from Maurice Blanchot and Georges Bataille on Sade, with an emphasis on the question of sovereignty on its aesthetic, ethical, political, ontological, and literary registers. Their readings critically reassess the modern biopolitical configuration of sovereign power and violence that reduces human life to nothing, all the while tracing a certain excess of being that traverses the language of Sade’s body of work. This notably sovereign excess, when displaced in the space of literature, dismantles the self-sufficient and autonomous subject on the one hand and taps into an insurgent potential of revolt on the other. My contention is that Beckett’s hitherto unpublished translations convey what he shares in common, albeit from a distance, with Blanchot and Bataille after Sade, alongside a wider counter-current of late modernist literature attuned to writing, thinking, and living from the standpoint of the impossible.","[{""name"": ""Michael Krimper"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3366/jobs.2022.0357"", ""10.3366/jobs.2022.0356"", ""10.3366/jobs.2022.0354"", ""10.1353/nlh.2020.0003"", ""10.3366/jobs.2016.0169"", ""10.3917/cite.047.0333"", ""10.1515/9780748675692-010"", ""10.1017/9781108771085"", ""10.3366/jobs.2022.0359""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Historicizing Indigenous theatre scholarship and production alongside Peter Morin and Jimmie Kilpatrick’s participatory karaoke performance, “Love Songs to End Colonization,” models disciplinary inclusion and how Indigenous performance challenges it. This essay turns to Glen Coulthard’s call for Indigenous resurgence and Dylan Robinson’s demonstration of disciplinary redress to explicate why Indigenous performance can be aesthetically and politically powerful. In singing these disparate ideas together, this essay considers the benefits and pitfalls of inclusion for Indigenous theatre into North American theatre production, scholarship, and higher education as well as issue a warning against complacent inclusion and mere celebrations of diversity. Indigenous performance asks more than theatre and performance studies often acknowledges; to engage with it robustly and productively, the field must be open to singing a song it is just beginning to learn.","[{""name"": ""Bethany Hughes"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Health', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Yet, it would be a challenge for an average European or American moviegoer to name a film actor from the Indian subcontinent. Naming the films may be easier. For instance, millennials may be able to name Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Generation X crowd may mention Gandhi (1982) and the older audiences may recall The Party (1968) and Ganga Din (1939) as movies about the Indians and India. It was not until the movie Gandhi that Indian actors were allowed to play as Indians. Sam Jaffe and Abner Biberman played as Indians in Ganga Din; Peter Sellers was the Indian actor in The Party, and Shirley MacLaine was the Princess Aouda in Around the World in 80 Days (1956).

They continue to raise the alarm about the status of women, and emphasize the determination of cunning women, even though films are still often made by men. However, the scenario of courageous figures with emblematic performances is increasingly replaced by a reminder of the relationships of domination and of violence against women, leading to the necessary legal changes.

NDP was developed over a number of years by pioneering UK drama therapist Sue Jennings. It is a culmination of attachment-based play, drama, movement and storytelling, and arts-based approaches that are used within drama therapy and other play and creative-based work with children. The author will consider from a personal and reflective perspective how NDP approaches can be adapted by drama therapists to work with older people with memory loss based on almost 30-years history of being involved in the field of drama therapy as a student and practioner, and his work with older people, at both the beginning of his career and his current reflections many years later.","[{""name"": ""Clive Holmwood"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122324004 University of Derby""]}]","[""10.1016/0197-4556(92)90002-6"", ""10.1080/02630672.1995.9689399"", ""10.1080/15548627.2019.1630222"", ""10.1080/13607863.2016.1199012"", ""10.1002/gps.3895"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2010.05.004"", ""10.1177/0263067220915419"", ""10.1177/153331750201700411"", ""10.1177/0263067219847912"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2020.101660"", ""10.1016/j.cnre.2016.06.011"", ""10.1016/S0197-4556(97)00102-0"", ""10.1386/dtr_00061_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Conservation', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"
10.1386/jicms_00019_1,JOURNAL OF ITALIAN CINEMA AND MEDIA STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Of shame and humiliation in Ladri di biciclette: 'Ciccio formaggio' and 'Tammurriata nera',"Abstract In what follows I analyse how two Neapolitan songs enhance viewer perspective of the personalities of the protagonists of the classic film of Italian neorealism, Ladri di biciclette (Bicycle Thieves) by , Antonio Ricci and his son Bruno. The first, 'Ciccio formaggio', casts into relief Antonio's masculine self-image, particularly his reaction to the impact of unemployment on his traditional role of pater familias and to the possibility of public humiliation, should he fail to retrieve his bicycle. While 'Ciccio' sheds light on the tension in the marital relationship, 'Tammurriata' allows the viewer to consider Bruno's marginalization within a self-perpetuating cycle of poverty, thus shifting focus, at least partially, from the father to the long-term effects on the son (for which Antonio feels shame born of inadequacy).","[{""name"": ""Joseph Francese"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000008800898X Michigan State University""]}]","[""10.1177/001458580704100209"", ""10.3138/9781442678484-006"", ""10.1179/026143409X12488561926540"", ""10.1037/1524-9220.1.1.21"", ""10.1386/jicms_00019_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'General Arts and Humanities', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7038), ('1301 艺术学', 0.7023)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

10.1386/smt_00134_1,STUDIES IN MUSICAL THEATRE,1303 Drama Film and Television,Now you know': On Sondheim and middle age,"This article examines how Stephen Sondheim persistently and profoundly probed the second act of life, especially the years of middle age. I didn’t know it when I began discovering Sondheim’s works as an adolescent, but his lyrical insights prepared me for ageing. He proffered a map and showed the risks of ‘the road you didn’t take’, while also evincing the profound ambivalence that accompanies the examined life. Time registers itself anew – through its disappearing act – in one’s sinew and memory alike. Ageing variously enables some things and disables others; it forces one to grapple with various kinds of deaths – material and metaphoric – from small to shattering. Sondheim’s musicals stage these forays into ageing, and in what follows I explore how his works offer a prismatic view of middle age and beyond. Sondheim evinces how part of ageing deals with consequences – it is less about the road you didn’t take than the one that you did. And while a character inFollies(1971) implores us to ‘never look back’, much of Sondheim’s canon is about the wisdom gleaned from looking back, usually from the gimlet-eyed perspective of age and experience.","[{""name"": ""Ryan Donovan"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419367961 Duke University""]}]","[""10.18574/nyu/9781479845637.003.0012""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In this article, I argue that Rosi’s filmmaking technique privileges patience and stasis and that it consequently allows manifestations of the air, including wind, breath, bubbles and smoke, to attain prominence in his shots. I draw on the work of Gernot Böhme, Tonino Griffero and Robert Spadoni to suggest that the emphasis Rosi places on the air grants the film a pervasive formal unity that literalizes the notion of cinematic atmosphere. I also argue that the film’s ‘atmospheric aesthetic’ offers up the air’s spatial and corporeal complexity as a formal cipher for the film’s themes of separation and connection, and that it offers a way of thinking through Notturno’s intertextual relationship to Rosi’s previous film, Fuocoammare (Fire at Sea) (2016).","[{""name"": ""Damien Pollard"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121885934 University of Cambridge""]}]","[""10.1177/072551369303600107"", ""10.1080/10509208.2019.1606558"", ""10.33178/alpha.18.02"", ""10.1386/jicms_00142_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

The works of María Lugones, Elaine Salo, Azille Coetzee and Louise Du Toit, and Pumla Dineo Gqola allow us to interpret and apply Laura Mulvey’s male gaze within the raced and gendered South African context shaped by colonialism. We show that even though Dumisa displays an awareness of the power relations in looking, and even though she problematizes male looking, the way she uses the camera to frame the look continues to centre the gaze of the men in the film.","[{""name"": ""Tina-Louise Smith"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419371151 University of Cape Town""]}, {""name"": ""Alexia Smit"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419371151 University of Cape Town""]}]","[""10.1177/1350506817732589"", ""10.1353/trn.2012.0008"", ""10.2307/1225639"", ""10.1080/02560046.2015.1039198"", ""10.1177/13675494030063005"", ""10.1386/jac.3.1.3_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Madrid, which began its time as capital of Franco’s Spain as a city that had to be purged of its sins, became crucial to the hierarchical, centralized control of the nation, and thus was prioritized over the countryside and provincial capitals. As a result, the segmented, ordered space of Madrid’s urban planning was quickly overwhelmed by the number of arriving migrants who moved from the periphery of the nation to the periphery of the capital. Two films from opposite ends of the decade and of the political spectrum, José Antonio Nieves Conde’s Surcos/Furrows (Nieves Conde 1951) and Carlos Saura’s Los golfos/The Delinquents (), highlight the plight of both recent and more-established migrants to Madrid. The methods that the characters in these films use to gain access to the centre of Spanish social imaginary (i.e., crime and spectacle) are doomed to failure because they are inherently marginal activities. The films frame their protagonists’ movement through urban space to show that the economic modernization of the Franco regime in the 1950s failed to live up to expectations for improving the social well-being of the city’s inhabitants.","[{""name"": ""Adam L.

The Cartesian occasionalist advanced that self-inspection culminates with the revelation of human beings’ fundamental ignorance and impotence. I suggest that the short text borrows Geulingian themes and imagery to offer a dazzling vision – from the point of view of eternity – of the radical atomization and opacity of the human condition. Furthermore, I explore how Beckett generates a specifically Geulingian commentary on a debate that obsessed him throughout his life: the problem of the subject-object relation and the self-to-self relation in artistic representation. Finally, I propose to read the paradoxical imperative ‘imagination dead imagine’ as a Geulingian axiom in its own right, that is, as an inescapable obligation whose fulfilment is quasi-impossible.","[{""name"": ""François-Nicolas Vozel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/mod.2011.0110"", ""10.3366/jobs.2011.0004"", ""10.1017/9781108399852"", ""10.3998/mpub.15933"", ""10.3366/jobs.2012.0047"", ""10.2307/606812"", ""10.1163/18757405-024001020"", ""10.1515/9781474414418"", ""10.1515/9780691196787"", ""10.1017/9781108559331.003""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The kind of freedom that Fern's narrative evokes stands in deliberate contrast to the masculinized, heroic style of freedom that American films have done so much to promulgate. In contrast to this conventional representation of freedom, new materialist criticism has examined the many ways that human agency emerges from within a dense web of interconnections that bind together human beings with one another, with other life forms, with inanimate matter, and with the cosmic expanses of time and space. Nomadland can be understood as a film that picks up the iconography of conventional American cinematic freedom in order to redirect this iconography into a new materialist worldview.","[{""name"": ""Randy Laist"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bridgeport""]}]","[""10.1215/9781478022404"", ""10.1215/9780822391623"", ""10.1215/9780822373780"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195335637.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctt16gzq85.11"", ""10.2307/j.ctt16gzq85.22"", ""10.2307/j.ctt16gzq85.6""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The play depicts the deportation of an Estonian family to Siberia in the fall of 1946. The Finnish National Theatre invited Estonian Mati Unt to act as the director. The actors were Finnish, as were the audience, apart from a few individual spectators and during a short visit when Departure was performed in Estonia. The aim is to analyze how a theatre performance connected with an aspect of Estonian traumatic history and national memory was understood and felt by a country with a different historical and contemporary background. The performances of Departure show the ways in which repetition, memory, and re-appearance work and function in the theatre. Departure as theatre had power over history in its ability to reshape the image of the past through physical presence and affection. It increased in Finland the knowledge of and empathy toward Estonia and the presence of Estonian culture before the great political upheavals. However, the Finnish audience constructed the meanings of the play without the interaction between the collective memory, that is, the Finnish “memory” was historical and theatrical. Concerning national collective memory, it was not possible to cross the border.","[{""name"": ""Pirkko Koski"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

H. Auden’s ‘Mountains’ (1954) describes climbers as ‘those unsmiling parties, / Clumping off at dawn in the gear of their mystery / For points up’. By this time, such gear was likely to include an oxygen rig. Attitudes to support of the human breath ‘on the hill’ in the early twentieth century were fractured and controversial. Oxygen-less attempts were associated with fairness and a sense of the sporting, as pushing the body to un-assisted limits on the highest peaks became entangled with notions of masculinity, in a post-Great War era when younger generations sought challenges that their elders had found through conflict. Auden’s gear might be one of ‘mystery’, but it also brought a jarring modernity into atavistic struggles between body and rock. Mountain literature pre-1953 registers the imperfect incorporation of oxygen supply ‘gear’ in a poetic context, and a breathed line, where it has not been present. The deployment of oxygen brought issues now associated with modernist culture onto the mountainside, while debates raged about who got to breathe the air of the Himalayas, and who—having deployed air-in-a-bottle—might not be said to have climbed them at all.","[{""name"": ""Abbie Garrington"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4159/harvard.9780674074521"", ""10.1017/S0007087412000775"", ""10.2307/1781919"", ""10.1515/9780691211770""]",['Psychology'],['Social Psychology'],"[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

Transcribed interviews with six elite voice teachers in the Broadway community are analysed and placed into a conceptual framework of the ‘omnivorous voice’ (based on sociologist Richard Peterson’s writings on cultural omnivorousness and sociologist Antoine Hennion’s writings on tastes); the article also engages with Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis. Four central themes are generated and discussed: (1) understanding omnivorous code-switching and shape-shifting as a fundamental potential of the voice, (2) manoeuvring vocal omnivorousness by carefully attending to sonic information, (3) searching for authenticity in an omnivorous vocal world and (4) expanding and diversifying vocal aesthetics beyond musical styles and genres. This article contributes to the fields of performing arts pedagogy and voice training in musical theatre, and aims to provide insights into how vocal technique and vocal aesthetics are influenced by, taught in, and created in dialogue with the communities and societies in which our voices exist. The last is especially explored in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Guro von Germeten"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107206712 Norwegian Academy of Music""]}]","[""10.1386/smt_00047_7"", ""10.1080/2159676X.2019.1628806"", ""10.1080/14780887.2020.1769238"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2019.03.004"", ""10.1386/smt_00094_1"", ""10.1016/j.jvoice.2013.10.007"", ""10.1177/1749975507073923"", ""10.3390/arts9020058"", ""10.1525/jpms.2019.31.4.32"", ""10.1016/0304-422X(92)90008-Q"", ""10.2307/2096460"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2015.05.004"", ""10.1353/sof.2001.0017"", ""10.1177/1321103X221081787"", ""10.1177/1749975507078185"", ""10.1080/14797585.2011.613222"", ""10.1386/smt_00112_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Focusing specifically on Fincher’s music video work, the article investigates how Propaganda’s talent management strategies helped to develop Fincher’s career and construct him as an auteur. To do so, the article adopts a cultural production approach conceptualizing the auteur as a branded identity and discourse mobilized in promotional and critical materials. In doing so, the article shows how Propaganda helped to single out Fincher’s videos as artistic works showcasing the exceptional talent of an aspiring feature-filmmaker. At the same time, however, the article considers how Propaganda’s talent management strategies contributed to sustaining problematic cultural notions surrounding music video and short-form work in general. As a result, the article advocates adopting new and more diverse approaches when examining short-form work and interrelated industry practice.","[{""name"": ""Andrew Stubbs"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000106863366 Staffordshire University""]}]","[""10.1017/S0261143000002932"", ""10.1386/sfs_00054_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Urban Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

It considers the soundtrack to have equal value as the visual track. This is even more appalling when sound is viewed as an aesthetic constituent of a film or as acoustic signs with equal communicative value as visual signs. Two films are used to show the role music and sound play in facilitating comprehension in a documentary film. Focusing particularly on testimonies, narrative commentary, filmic silence and music, the study shows how documentary films provide a unique medium to engage an audience in a story of facts and provides a unique vehicle for information transmission. The success of these two films among mainstream audiences indicates the power of a thoughtful and intentional soundtrack which accentuates the subject without dictating it and provides examples of a utilisation of music to build an emotional connection between the audience and the film’s subject matter.","[{""name"": ""Paul Animbom Ngong"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science']","['Communication', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Tati suggested that his films allow more visual freedom to audiences and that audiences discover new material upon multiple viewings of his films. We review the scholarship on Tati, especially in relation to critic André Bazin’s theories of realism, and then propose another model for understanding Tati’s films: the psychological concept of inattentional blindness. The article then discusses our experiment using eye tracking technology to study how subjects watch Tati’s films versus other types of cinema and also how they re-watch films. Finally, we applied several statistical and mathematical tests to the eye tracking data to understand key differences between Tati’s films and other filmmaking practices.","[{""name"": ""Eric Faden"", ""affiliation"": [""Bucknell University, USA efaden@bucknell.edu""]}, {""name"": ""Aaron Mitchel"", ""affiliation"": [""Bucknell University, USA adm018@bucknell.edu""]}, {""name"": ""Alexander Murph"", ""affiliation"": [""PhD Student, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA acm026@bucknell.edu""]}, {""name"": ""Taylor Myers"", ""affiliation"": [""Upper Elementary Teacher, TMS School, Philadelphia, USA tmyers@themontessorischool.us""]}, {""name"": ""Nathan C.

The correspondence and (in)congruence between dance movements and music's kinetic energy become the means to examine a politics of the body and sound, of music on movement. Additionally, in this ‘auditory architecture’ the quanta of time, its relations and (lack of) unity are exposed. This article then examines the intersubjective interplay of movement and music, body and sonicity; it considers the resonance of the performing body as intermaterial vibration and how this invites a sonic politics of relational possibility.

Shaw spoke so little of her, revealing so little of his feelings for her, that we might wonder how important Agnes was to him and how her death affected him. Searching for what is known of Agnes led to a number of clues suggesting a close bond existed between Shaw and his sister. Shaw’s silence regarding the dates of the deaths of his sisters Lucy and Agnes speaks of unresolved mourning and complicated grief. What led Shaw to so protect himself from the emotional pain it appears he experienced from death and loss? Importantly, it appears that Shaw’s memories of Agnes and his wishes for her contributed to the creation of his iconic young heroines.","[{""name"": ""Jesse M.

This study focuses on the challenges posed by the Belarusian-EU border crisis (2021) and the proposed travel restrictions towards Russian citizens (2022) in the context of the Nordic-Baltic EU member states. The study addresses their impact through the double prisms of regionality and level of governance. The study looks at how national elite narratives on borders and the movement of people travel to the supranational context, in this case the European Parliament. While the Parliament is often overlooked in favour of the Council or the Commission, this study regards it as an effective analytical bridge between domestic and supranational decision-making levels. To achieve its empirical goals the study relies on governments’ official communiques, while the parliamentary analysis is based on pre-vote debates and Parliament’s roll-call votes. The article finds that, while the national narratives highlight a growing convergence of governmental narratives in adopting or justifying restrictive bordering measures, the EP debates and votes highlight the relevance of ideology and partisanship when it comes to the issue and the growing significance of the gap between mainstream and non-mainstream forces.","[{""name"": ""Stefano Braghiroli"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tartu, Estonia""]}, {""name"": ""Sandra Hagelin"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tartu, Estonia""]}]","[""10.1177/030437540503000103"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1990.tb00248.x"", ""10.1111/jcms.13398"", ""10.1080/13572334.2014.939559"", ""10.1080/14782804.2014.978747"", ""10.1080/14782804.2021.1934421"", ""10.5937/jrs18-41766"", ""10.1080/07036337.2019.1599371"", ""10.1080/13501763.2021.1984546"", ""10.1080/07036337.2016.1256397"", ""10.1080/14650045.2018.1508015"", ""10.1177/1354068814563972"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-21844-7"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00106"", ""10.1080/01402380701238741"", ""10.1215/9781478021476-001"", ""10.1177/1465116518755954"", ""10.1080/14782804.2017.1348340"", ""10.13110/narrcult.6.1.0001"", ""10.1080/08865655.2023.2276475"", ""10.1177/0010836721989363"", ""10.1080/01402382.2023.2202981"", ""10.1080/02684527.2014.988446"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12252"", ""10.1080/14782804.2022.2086108"", ""10.1080/09662839.2020.1842362"", ""10.1080/14650045.2016.1195132"", ""10.1163/15718069-12341353"", ""10.1007/978-94-6265-011-4_9"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2020.1851469"", ""10.1080/08865655.2022.2104340"", ""10.1093/pa/gsn038"", ""10.1080/08865655.2016.1247652"", ""10.1080/14608944.2016.1256982"", ""10.1111/lsq.12165"", ""10.15166/2499-8249/353"", ""10.1080/14650045.2012.706111"", ""10.1080/13600826.2013.790784"", ""10.1177/0888325499013001005"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-8384-6_2"", ""10.1093/fpa/oraa010"", ""10.1177/1465116517716311"", ""10.1080/01629778.2013.846928"", ""10.1080/07036337.2016.1277713"", ""10.1177/0192512106064474"", ""10.1111/jcms.12397"", ""10.1080/07036337.2020.1792460"", ""10.1093/fpa/orab020"", ""10.1177/1465116516687399"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1619803""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

It explores the voice as an object of cinematic representation and as a focal point of affective investments in a transnational context of postcolonial and neo-colonial power struggles. Furthermore, it scrutinizes a selection of voices that speak and sing throughout the series and considers the location of these voices across the soundtrack of Patino’s films. Through its mobile vocal aesthetic, Patino’s film series gestures towards an ethics of representation in which flamenco becomes a wandering signifier that can only be envisioned in the plural, through a myriad set of accented voices and memories.","[{""name"": ""Carlos Van Tongeren"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121662407 University of Manchester""]}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190261122.003.0002"", ""10.3989/arbor.2011.748n2003"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190261122.003.0003"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190261122.003.0005"", ""10.2307/852578"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190261122.003.0001"", ""10.1386/slac_00013_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Both the letter and postscript concern the refusal by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) to license a public showing of a motion picture, The Night Patrol, chiefly because one of its principal subjects, like that of Mrs Warren’s Profession, which the Lord Chamberlain had censored for the stage for the same reason in 1898, was prostitution. Only at the end of his letter, does Shaw identify her name: “Miss Baxter.” While some information about Violet Elizabeth (Betty) Baxter (1901–1972) has surfaced since then, this extended footnote to Shaw’s letter and postscript provides more.","[{""name"": ""Bernard F.

In An Invisible Minority (2018), the artist infiltrated the MAC as a security guard after assessing that this was the only culturally diverse body of employees in the museum. Février then showed an installation at ARTEXTE composed of statistics, comparative charts, and other quantitative data points that highlighted the lack of representation in Montreal galleries and museums. It’s Happening Now (2019) was a guerrilla action organized with other collaborators where performers clad in black skinsuits dragged fifty years of annual reports by the MAC tied to their ankles before shredding them in the museum’s main lobby. In conjunction with these project, MAC-I was created as an alternate, unsanctioned portal to the MAC official website to promote the practices of non-white Québécois and Canadian artists. While Février’s figurative sculptural work has garnered attention, with recent acquisitions by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, his more immaterial, institutionally critical, performative works remain undervalued and framed as ‘activism’ rather than their own aesthetic events.","[{""name"": ""Didier Morelli"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-60261-5_19"", ""10.3917/espri.2013.0014"", ""10.7202/1054381ar"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816679669.001.0001""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['History', 'History and Philosophy of Science', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

While acknowledging the multiple differences between each film, I argue that they also share many common themes and motifs. These include a determination to depict Belfast as a city shaped as much by a down-to-earth working class identified by their sense of community as by its official history of the Troubles. Both celebrate friendships across the religious divide, and both share a utopian sensibility, expressed as much through aesthetics as narrative devices. My argument centres on the imaginative construction of Belfast in both films, while also drawing attention to how devices, such as the inclusion of songs by Van Morrison, open the works up to a wider process of exilic identity construction. I also consider the issue of ‘cultural Protestantism’ as evidenced in Branagh’s film and how cinema’s own history intersects with the personal histories of both film-makers.","[{""name"": ""Ruth Barton"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.24193/ekphrasis.26.3"", ""10.1515/9783110279818-059"", ""10.1080/09670882.2021.1944031"", ""10.1386/seci.4.2.125_1"", ""10.5040/9781838711061"", ""10.1353/nhr.2020.0030"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198791591.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190238247.001.0001"", ""10.1353/frm.0.0007""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

The aim of this study is to explore the symbiosis between nostalgia and adaptation in Hong Kong cinema within the cultural landscape of 1950s Hong Kong, when Cold War politics was operating. With a detailed analysis of the 1953 Hong Kong film adaptation of mainland writer Ba Jin’s novel Family, and a comparative reading with the mainland film version produced in 1956, this study illustrates the cultural and historical significance of nostalgia in the development of Hong Kong cinema. This article further argues that nostalgic sentiment was expressed effectively through adaptations, while simultaneously improving these adaptations artistically and strengthening their political alignment with the mainland.","[{""name"": ""Yi Li"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Auckland""]}]","[""10.4324/9780203222072"", ""10.4324/9780203337820"", ""10.1111/j.1537-4726.2000.2301_27.x"", ""10.1080/01463370109385634"", ""10.1177/0097700404264506"", ""10.1080/00472719.1977.10661834"", ""10.1515/9780691186214"", ""10.3167/9781845455590"", ""10.1515/9780804799737"", ""10.1215/00267929-2007-022"", ""10.1002/9781444355994.ch14"", ""10.1080/01292980903293379""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The article explores the emergence of other, medium-specific occurrences of the effect, prioritizing interactivity as a key factor in its establishment. Two unique areas are particularly prominent in the increasingly photorealistic worlds of video games where uncanny moments associated with the wider, Freudian concept can be found. These are linked to necessary (structuring) and contingent (destructuring) components of the game: namely its heterogeneous ontology and the glitches that may appear in it. The author hypothesizes that these less conceptualized uncanny situations are regular features of the gaming experience and emerge when the immersion in an iconically realistic environment has been broken and eerie absences or ghostly presences pop up either through encounters with the game’s boundaries that result from the technological limitations of the software or the appearance of unintended errors in its processes.","[{""name"": ""Tamás Csönge"", ""affiliation"": [""1 University of Pécs ( Hungary )""]}]","[""10.31176/apertura.2019.14.2.6"", ""10.31176/apertura.2021.16.3.2"", ""10.1177/0894439306289510"", ""10.7557/23.6047"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2016.09.010"", ""10.1145/1822348.1822363"", ""10.1109/MRA.2012.2192811"", ""10.31176/apertura.2021.16.3.4"", ""10.14746/hl.2019.12.7"", ""10.14746/hl.2019.12.11""]","['Social Sciences', 'Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

There are such types of characters as doll, puppet, mechatron, robot, cyborg or artificial person (posthuman). The duality inherent in them is manifested, on the one hand, in the desire of an artificial creature to imitate a human being, and, on the other hand, in the desire of a human being to partly become a machine in order to overcome the biological imperfection. The ambivalent nature of created beings gives rise to conflicting feelings: from amusement and admiration to detachment, confusion and fear. While humans remain the point of reference in the development of such characters, the position of people in relation to artificial creations is changing. Until the 1960s–1970s, the dominant characteristic in the animation of artificial creatures was the desire to make them look more like biological beings. By the end of the twentieth century, the tendency changed to shifting away from human identity or to offering other variations of it. The reason for this is the pedaling of the idea of human imperfection, against which artificial creatures seem to be closer to the ideal. Not only has the position of the artificial towards the human altered: the distance between the two is also reducing, and they even come towards the point of convergence. Artificial beings appear as more perfect creatures, the main function of which is to save and preserve humans as a species.","[{""name"": ""NATALIA G.

10.5195/cinej.2024.646,CINEJ CINEMA JOURNAL,1303 Drama Film and Television,Masochistic Performance of Scheherazade: A Multimodal Analysis of Prince Charming,"This study attempts to highlight the embedded masochist aesthetics supporting the masochistic patterns in a Pakistani short film Prince Charming (2021), directed by Sheheryar Munawar Siddiqui, a Pakistani actor, film producer, director and television host. The focus remains on female protagonist, Scheherazade’s performative masochistic proclivities in an unsatisfactory marital relationship. This research takes Freud’s notion of repetitive compulsion as its referential point that triggers masochism and identifies Scheherazade’s urges and desires. Though masochism is about gaining the pleasure while bearing the pain, in the case of the film the pain is self-inflicted in the form of silence, inexpressibility, self-talks and romantic void between Scheherazade and her husband Akbar. This research offers a stand point to comprehend the subliminal threads of visual masochism which are apparently hidden in the film but are the prospective hooks to elaborate the psychological suffering of the character. The research propagates the idea that masochist aesthetics are nevertheless the stepping stone for pointing out the masochist self of Scheherazade, well exhibited through her performance.","[{""name"": ""Attiya Zafar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nadia Anwar"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Gender Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.3366/jobs.2023.0390,JOURNAL OF BECKETT STUDIES,0502 Foreign Language and Literature; 1303 Drama Film and Television,Maria Irene Fornes and Samuel Beckett: 'Different and the Same',"Maria Irene Fornes is one of the most revered American playwrights. Dramatists she influenced, actors she directed in her plays, students she mentored in her playwriting workshops, as well as academics who taught and published essays and books on her diverse output – over 40 plays in her 40-year career – share Tony Kushner’s assessment that ‘‘America has produced no dramatist of greater importance’. Born in Havana, Cuba in 1930, Fornes came to New York in 1945, and by the early 1960s, she was a central force in the establishment of the Off-Off Broadway avant-garde movement in Greenwich Village. In 1953 she saw the original production of En attendant Godot in Paris and was inspired to become a playwright. Over the years, critics have cited Beckett’s impact on Fornes; however, this is the first essay to provide a detailed study of the specific ways Beckett’s plays influenced Fornes' dramas, particularly Tango Palace, Dr. Kheal, Fefu and her Friends, and Mud. Following Beckett, she jettisoned cohesive plots, traditional themes, outworn theatrical tropes, predictable endings, familiar settings, and identifiable characters declaiming to audiences where a play is heading and why. Most importantly, Beckett illustrated that different theatre forms were possible. This essay illustrates how Fornes, inspired by, but not imitating Beckett, made her own assault on conventional drama, The essay is also the first to delineate the ways in which Fornes' first play, Tango Palace, derives from her three-year love affair with Susan Sontag.","[{""name"": ""Linda Ben-Zvi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/01610775-17-1-51""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The portraits of the affectionate and dialectical relationship, which the brother and the sister shared, remain forever etched in the memory of the cinephiles. Apu’s metamorphosis into an adult over the course of the trilogy has been comprehensively scrutinized by film scholars and aficionados, but Durga has not enjoyed much critical spotlight. This paper examines the germination, evolution, and the trajectory of the adolescent sexuality of the teenage Durga, played by Uma Dasgupta, by dissecting her performative act in the film. The paper explores the construction of the image of Durga in the film and her place in the patriarchal ecosystem, arguing that Durga is in a constant process of negotiation with the patriarchal structure, occasionally entering and exiting the patriarchal domain to assert her sexuality: she defies patriarchal protocols yet sometimes gets subjugated by it. This process continues throughout the film, culminating in her death which could be interpreted as a metaphoric punishment she received for her assertion of her formidable sexuality.","[{""name"": ""Rebanta Gupta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aniket Roy"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

As driver and fixer of a robot, an automobile, and graduate of a polytechnic school, Straker as a kind of “Roboman” represents the science and engineering prowess of humankind that has already thoroughly mechanized the planet and that threatens humankind with an increasing automation in all phases of life, potentially capped off by a world overrun with advanced robots. This possibility raises the question of whether the organic evolution from “man” to “superman” that is central to the philosophy of Man and Superman may find competition from an inorganic, Engineered Evolution that may follow from Homo sapiens inadvertently replacing itself with something superior to the projected “superman” in the form of highly sophisticated android robots that could “pass” as humans.","[{""name"": ""Richard Farr Dietrich"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

In particular, it explores dialogues between Malabou's work on biomedical understandings of bodily plasticity and filmic representations of medical interventions in the body. This article specifically explores Malabou in relation to Katell Quillévéré's film Heal the Living ( Réparer les vivants, 2016), an adaptation of Maylis de Kerangal's novel The Heart ( Réparer les vivants, 2014). The film tells the story of Simon Limbres, who is taken to a hospital following a road accent and pronounced brain dead. The film then explores how Simon undergoes organ donation, following his organs on their journey to other bodies in need. I argue that Heal the Living allows us to challenge and extend Malabou's central thinking of (neuro)plasticity, precisely by emphasising the plasticity of the body beyond and in the wake of the brain. Further, the film's emphasis on transplantation allows for an exploration of interpersonal plasticity, developing an ethics of transplanted plasticity in testing and extending conceptions of otherness and alterity central to Malabou's thinking.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Dalton"", ""affiliation"": [""Lancaster University""]}]","[""10.3366/film.2008.0004"", ""10.5040/9781350077829"", ""10.1080/26438941.2021.2022359"", ""10.7312/crow20402"", ""10.2307/j.ctvs32scr.9"", ""10.3366/nfs.2023.0390"", ""10.1353/book12687"", ""10.3917/puf.malab.2017.03"", ""10.2298/FID1504813M"", ""10.3366/film.2008.0003"", ""10.1353/ncr.2002.0052"", ""10.1353/dia.2013.0003""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

With detailed reference to Mitleid (2016) and La Reprise (2018), this article examines Rau’s self-reflexive strategies in (re)presenting testimony or an event as a means not of depicting the real, but of making the theatrical representation itself real in order to change the world rather than merely to portray it. The article focuses in particular on strategies relating to the actor-character and spectatorship. Rau’s interest in the positions of the actor and spectator illuminates issues that have arisen in the discourse of theatre witnessing and in recent scholarship on dramaturgical approaches and spectatorship in contemporary political performance. Essentially, Rau makes the performer’s habitus transparent, and challenges the spectator’s reflexivity, effectively rebutting the largely unchallenged assumption that characters who perform witnesses necessarily leave little room for the spectator to be a performing witness.

In 1833 Thomas Carlyle referred to the fog as ‘that horrid flood of Spartan black-broth’. Inhalation became digestion, but of food commonly associated with the poor; ‘pea-souper’, the most common name for London fog, referred to cheap, yellow split-pea soup. Even in 1951, Henry Morton recalled a ‘thick pea-souper which tastes like iron filings’. When does breathing become eating or drinking?

Using the popularity of these films and other Nordic titles on the world’s leading subscription video-on-demand (SVoD) platform as a point of departure, this article investigates the changing industrial landscape for film production and distribution in the region in light of the influence that streaming platforms are having therein. The focus is on a detailed case study of the integrated studio SF Studios, which produced two of these three landmark films as well as numerous others that were released as Netflix original movies between 2020 and 2023. In addition to illuminating the business and creative practices of both SF and Netflix, the article argues that deals such as these are fomenting greater artistic diversity in Scandinavia by opening up distribution pathways and production resources for popular genre films from the region.","[{""name"": ""Christopher Meir"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121689183 Universidad Carlos III de Madrid""]}]","[""10.1177/17496020211023318"", ""10.1177/02673231211012174"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-42182-2_12"", ""10.1080/17400309.2011.556944""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1093/adaptation/apaa017,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Localizing Romeo and Juliet: Ram-Leela, Female Agency, and Indian Politics","Abstract This essay explores Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela (dir. Sanjay Leela Bhansali, 2013), a Bollywood adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, from a local/political and female-centred angle. Bhansali’s Romeo and Juliet localizes and provincializes Romeo and Juliet by situating it in Gujarat with recognizable traditional dance numbers, and considerably mythologizes the hypotext1 by the prioritization given to festivals and the parallels between the leading pair and well-known Hindu divinities. But, localization is not exempt from problems in this film, for dance and Hindu myths are both markers of tension in modern-day India. The constant ambiguities they bring up inevitably point to the non-isomorphic flows that characterize the nation-state. This tension also finds its niche in the depiction of women in the film. Bhansali’s adaptation equally shows women that are oppressed—the girl in the item number (musical number inserted in the film) and the widows (neither finding a Shakespearean counterpart)—women that are at one and the same time oppressed and resistant (Dhankor Baa/Lady Capulet and Leela/Juliet), and some women showing signs of female agency at the end of the adaptation. National tensions find their counterpart in tensions that inform Ram-Leela as an adaptation: this is a work that is both a Shakespearean adaptation and a Bollywood film, the two forms interacting with each other in a unique combination. Ram-Leela not only provides new understandings of Romeo and Juliet and, ultimately, Shakespeare, but also of the contingencies and complexities of modern-day India.","[{""name"": ""Rosa García-Periago"", ""affiliation"": [""Marie Curie Research Fellow, School of Arts, English and Languages, Queen’s University Belfast""]}]","[""10.1353/shb.2015.0060"", ""10.4324/9781315670409"", ""10.4324/9781315645018"", ""10.4324/9780203643945"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.1080/14746689.2013.764642"", ""10.2307/1177550"", ""10.5040/9781472567109"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195369908.001.0001"", ""10.1080/07491409.2002.10162440"", ""10.4324/9780429022807-16"", ""10.4324/9781315670409""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Set in a predominantly White Finnish society, the film confronts many representational challenges concerning diversity, whether racial, class or gender. Based on contextual analysis of audio-visual representations, we discuss how such categories contribute to the construction of the film’s ‘authenticity’ – a key notion of hip hop culture – as a localized representation. We argue that in its project of localizing hip hop authenticity in early 2000s Finland, the film retains, rather than challenges or questions, representations of normative Whiteness, oppressive class distinctions and unequal gender norms.","[{""name"": ""Elina Westinen"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000110137965 University of Jyväskylä""]}, {""name"": ""Sanna Karkulehto"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000110137965 University of Jyväskylä""]}, {""name"": ""Mervi Tervo"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Scholar""]}]","[""10.1080/0300776032000144922"", ""10.1080/03007760410001733170"", ""10.1017/S1742058X14000290"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2009.09.005"", ""10.1080/07393180500342878"", ""10.1080/10350330.2020.1766199"", ""10.1080/01419870.2012.664278"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1999.tb02821.x"", ""10.1080/10304312.2020.1757038"", ""10.1080/10350330601019892"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-78990-3_14"", ""10.1080/03007766.2018.1526527"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59244-2_5"", ""10.1386/jsca.7.3.225_1"", ""10.1515/ijsl-2021-0115"", ""10.1353/cj.2003.0004"", ""10.1177/1367549409105366"", ""10.1386/jsca.4.1.61_1"", ""10.1080/03007766.2012.740819"", ""10.1177/095892879900900304"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59244-2_6"", ""10.1016/j.tourman.2006.03.009""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Gender Studies', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Despite the variety of the holdings, the museum has a coherence for researchers, allowing scholars to evidence continuities as well as changes across the history which it charts. We will show how this works in three distinct ways. Firstly we will consider how research on the everyday ephemera of cinema, and the optical media that preceded it, which forms much of the collection, such as programmes, publicity material or merchandise, can illuminate our understanding of film history as it is lived: what Raymond Williams saw as ‘the structures of feeling’ underpinning popular culture. Second, we will draw on examples from the stipend scheme that we operate, whereby awards enable researchers from around the world to explore our holdings in order to discover new paths through this history. How has material found within collections complicated research questions or allowed scholars to make connections between the past and the present? Lastly, we will explore how artefacts gain meanings from the processes of their curation.

Finally, I discuss the implications of this new approach for classical European film industries that consider film a cultural good rather than a strictly commercial product.","[{""name"": ""Jakob Freudendal"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000119562722 Aarhus University""]}]","[""10.18146/2213-0969.2019.jethc179"", ""10.1177/1461444820929316"", ""10.1080/14241277.2017.1298108"", ""10.1177/1329878X16687400"", ""10.1177/1749602017730262"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-97322-7_8"", ""10.1177/17496020211005999"", ""10.1386/josc_00066_2"", ""10.1108/AAM-10-2018-0013""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Urban Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"
10.1386/jams_00088_1,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN MEDIA STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0503 Journalism and Communication; 0303 Sociology,Linguistic and communication exclusion in COVID-19 awareness campaigns in Malawi,"The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has unravelled the significance of having robust communication structures about health and disease to dynamic societies. The need to construct a mutual understanding of health issues has become imperative, and achieving a universal understanding of the disease burden requires robust information-sharing processes which can easily surmount the barriers to communication. What is challenging, however, is to communicate in a way and in a language that the majority of the population understands. In Malawi, where the majority of the population (84 per cent) live in rural areas, and without access to information technologies, it becomes more challenging when devising messages that should reach such hard-to-reach populations. This therefore begs the question: how effective is the COVID-19 communication to the Malawi public domain? This article attempts to answer this question by discussing the language choice vis-à-vis the lingua-cultural needs of the masses in COVID-19 awareness, and the strategies and modes of communication in COVID-19 communication. In view of this, the article argues that the government communication strategies concerning COVID-19 were not entirely effective. The article notes that the use of English in most of the COVID-19 messages has excluded the majority and has perpetuated the attitude of perceiving COVID-19 as a disease for the rich people. The modes being used in communicating COVID-19 do not effectively reach the masses since the media penetration is minimal resulting in most Malawians getting second-hand information and developing myths and conspiracy theories. The article concludes that it is imperative for Malawi to devise a contextually appropriate framework for communicating complex health messages.","[{""name"": ""Peter Mayeso Jiyajiya"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000449019642 Malawi University of Science and Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Atikonda Mtenje-Mkochi"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000449019642 Malawi University of Science and Technology""]}]","[""10.1080/13698570802166431"", ""10.1080/02560049985310111"", ""10.1080/02580136.2019.1665817"", ""10.1016/B978-012373960-5.00584-0"", ""10.1186/1475-2875-13-1"", ""10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123000"", ""10.1080/03033910.1988.10557705"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-45471-9_7"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-091908-164450"", ""10.1386/jams_00088_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Political distinctions at the end of the end of history,"This review essay argues that once a fuller genealogy of populism is presented, Hochuli et al.’s rationale for attempting to corral the left into an embrace of nationalism begins to look suspicious. Despite the authors’ claims, the genealogy of American left populism reveals a political project that is not at all aligned with the virtue-hoarding desires of the left flank of the Professional Managerial Class (PMC). To the contrary, it is a political project synonymous with the material struggles of the global working class. Thus, while we should concede that the contemporary Left has been captured to no small degree by PMC sensibilities, a full understanding of today’s ongoing revival in socialism requires further explanation. To this end, this essay argues that we need a proper discussion about the history of left populism in the United States, its meaningful achievements, and its potential as a strategic partner. Admittedly, the term “populism” has very different valences, depending on whether it is used in an American or European context. But it cannot be gainsaid that the term originated in America, and that American populism has hewed more toward working class struggle over the sort of “woke” ideologies, worried about in The End of the End of History.","[{""name"": ""Nicholas Kiersey"", ""affiliation"": [""The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley - Edinburg Campus, USA""]}]","[""10.3998/mpub.11595814"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1n9dkkw"", ""10.1080/13600820903198644"", ""10.1354/books/unregistered/9781452966458"", ""10.4324/9781003071709-2"", ""10.1080/07393148.2019.1595286""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Education', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

One result has been the employment of clientelistic strategies by political parties across the region. Clientelism in Polish politics has been present for three decades, however, the way it manifests itself today varies significantly from how it appeared in the past in terms of its scale but also because it has “thickened” by incorporating Catholic, national, and patriotic symbols. Furthermore, the number of contracting parties is not limited to the patron (PiS) and their clients (voters); a crucial role seems to be played by the organisations supported financially by the PiS government whose task may be to entice citizens to vote for the party. It can be argued that the financial standing of these organisations was built with support from the state budget and that their operations are highly dependent on these resources. We conclude that PiS has created a clientelistic machine formed by populist, nationalist, and religious ideological discourses.","[{""name"": ""Piotr Sula"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Wrocław, Institute of Political Science, Wrocław, Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Kamil Błaszczyński"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Wrocław, Institute of Political Science, Wrocław, Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Małgorzata Madej"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Wrocław, Institute of Political Science, Wrocław, Poland""]}]","[""10.1353/wp.1997.0008"", ""10.1016/s0967-067x(96)80019-5"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1787160"", ""10.1007/S12116-019-09295-0"", ""10.1177/1354068813519969"", ""10.1177/0888325420950800"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1787161"", ""10.23696/vdemds21"", ""10.1093/0199253099.003.0002"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199599356.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12182"", ""10.1146/ANNUREV.POLISCI.031908.220508"", ""10.1353/JOD.2002.0008"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511840012"", ""10.33896/SPolit.2020.57.6"", ""10.2307/1954886"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1992.tb00316.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00508"", ""10.1177/001041400003300607"", ""10.1177/0888325419826691"", ""10.1177/0001699313506721"", ""10.1515/9781400859498.13"", ""10.5129/001041519X15647434969911"", ""10.1007/s40803-018-0082-5"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139175340.010"", ""10.1353/JOD.1999.0015"", ""10.1093/OXFORDHB/9780199566020.003.0025"", ""10.1080/23745118.2016.1256027"", ""10.1177/0002716218809322"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.01995.x"", ""10.2307/4150132"", ""10.1080/09668136.2020.1784394""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

What does it mean to identify the process of performed seduction as central to much immersive dramaturgy? Through readings of contemporary productions that draw upon (or appropriate) pre-existing erotically charged environments, the inevitable responsibilities for makers working in this context of immersion are considered, as is the importance of considering the consequences for those working in immersive spaces. Stress is laid on the crucial role that this form of performative labour often plays in immersive performance, and a continued recognition of its influence is emphasized.

10.1386/jicms_00018_1,JOURNAL OF ITALIAN CINEMA AND MEDIA STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,LGBTQ+ female protagonists in horror cinema today: The Italian case,"Abstract This article examines representations of LGBTQ+ female protagonists in three recent Italian horror films: La terza madre (The Mother of Tears) by , A Pezzi: Undead Men by and The Antithesis by Mirabelli (2017). As homosexuality traditionally falls within the realm of the abject (that which is expelled) in horror films, the genre serves as a medium through which we may assess national and global sensibilities about LGBTQ+ identities. Filmic textual analysis and a consideration of horror and melodrama conventions reveal how these protagonists expose cultural anxieties about non-normative sexual orientations in Italy today. While these films include minority protagonists and offer some resistance to discrimination, they ultimately represent homosexuality as a threat to mainstream Italian culture.","[{""name"": ""Lauren De Camilla"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000478823007 The Ohio State University""]}]","[""10.1177/0037768618800750"", ""10.1386/jicms.5.2.153_2"", ""10.1093/screen/42.2.201"", ""10.1007/s10508-005-1002-z"", ""10.1007/s10991-010-9072-y"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-19798-9_5"", ""10.1177/1350508418790140"", ""10.1080/13501763.2013.761512"", ""10.2307/1212758"", ""10.1386/jicms_00018_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

While the relevance of such casting to Loach's project has been anecdotally acknowledged in criticism, this article recommends a more systematic historical and aesthetic approach. After summarising the theoretical considerations around acting as a practice and its ‘problem’ within Loach's terms, I consequently look at the broader institutional and political contexts of actor preparation training and casting in British television and film since Loach's emergence as a director in the 1960s, and the relevance of comedian casting within these. Drawing on a sample of Loach's films, I then offer a more systematic analysis of how the comedian's body, voice and action signify, examining how such ‘realist’ performances respond to the cultural conventions of ‘trained’ actor practice, as well as the narrative and broader institutional conventions of comedy performance in mainstream film.","[{""name"": ""Neil Archer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/978-1-137-47022-5"", ""10.1386/sdf.4.3.227_1"", ""10.4324/9780203883549"", ""10.1386/stap.21.3.176"", ""10.4324/9780203740279"", ""10.5040/9780571344086"", ""10.1080/09670882.2011.541653"", ""10.1017/S0266464X00014305"", ""10.4324/9780203022566"", ""10.1057/9780230246973_13"", ""10.1177/1329878X0210400106""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Using theories of Jewish narrative and Jewishness as articulated by (among others) Dara Horn and Daniel Boyarin, and musical theatre theory as conceived by David Savran, the article closely reads musicals including Merrily We Roll Along, Company, Sunday in the Park with George and Gypsy alongside Sondheim’s own memoir, Finishing the Hat. In examining Sondheim’s understanding of his own work, ‘Kaddish for Steve’ discovers a Jewish way of reading and writing within both the musicals and the memoir that closely aligns with Boyarin’s concept of ‘Jewissance’. The article concludes with a remembrance of Sondheim as spiritual and artistic teacher, honouring his continued influence on contemporary musical theatre and comparing his role in the lives of his many students to that of a rabbi.","[{""name"": ""Gabrielle Hoyt"", ""affiliation"": [""David Geffen School of Drama""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

The role of dramaturgs within the socialist mode of children's film development,"The dramaturgs of the Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft (DEFA), the GDR’s state-owned film production company, played a particular role in socialist children’s film culture. Within the production process, they acted as important mediators as well as developed themes and defended them before the state film censors. In this article, I argue that screenwriting for children and the changing role of the dramaturg were remarkable inasmuch as the creative collaboration between authors, dramaturgs and directors became a collective process of navigating between politics, education, film and the young audience that can reasonably be described as ‘collective authorship’. First, I will show how DEFA children’s film production was an example of the ‘state-socialist mode of children’s film production’ and examine Szczepanik’s model in the light of the current question. Following this, I will examine the structural and practical development of children’s film production in view of both official images of the child and the images of children anticipated by the filmmakers. At the same time, I will discuss the role of dramaturgs as participants in a collective authorship process.","[{""name"": ""Steffi Ebert"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000106792801 University of Halle-Wittenberg""]}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198159216.003.0007"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00257.x"", ""10.1057/9781137282187_8"", ""10.1386/josc_00067_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

He was a master of self-invention, a nobody who captured the zeitgeist and one of the first private individuals to understand fully how to generate—and how to use—global fame.

Dealing with the present by looking to the past, the series critiques the architectural reconstruction that changed the face of the country during the post-war years and beyond. This transformation is seen through the jaundiced eye of series protagonist Joe Lampton, a 1950s anti-hero recycled for a more uncertain age. He finds himself caught between the pull of tradition and the push for progress – forces aligned respectively with the industrial North (his native Yorkshire) and the cosmopolitan South (his contemporaneous London-based life). Why, in the broader context of the early 1970s, must Lampton’s North be identified with the past? How does materiality work to frame remembrance? The article responds to these questions by mapping the series, along with television culture more generally, onto its socio-political moment. It arrives at conclusions via a constructionist analysis that draws on ‘New Left’ inflected discourses, on the one hand, and philosophies relating to collective memory and materiality on the other.","[{""name"": ""Philip Kiszely"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368403 University of Leeds""]}]","[""10.1353/sor.2008.0038"", ""10.1386/jptv.4.2.195_7"", ""10.1086/654912"", ""10.1177/1750698016679222"", ""10.1177/0011392106068458"", ""10.1525/rep.1989.26.1.99p0274v"", ""10.1086/448963"", ""10.1080/00420986520080011"", ""10.1386/jptv_00016_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The national and international relevance of Ugo Fantozzi,"Ugo Fantozzi was given life by author and actor Paolo Villaggio in the late 1960s. Inarguably a staple figure within Italian comedy and society, this character remains relevant in modern-day society despite the last film being released in 1999. The Italianità of the Fantozzi series, partially based on people from Villaggio’s life, is unmistakeable. In this article, the Fantozzi films are analysed to show how Fantozzi can be considered so uniquely Italian through many of the themes, dialogue and references to society and culture, yet, at the same time, a universal comedic figure who shares many traits with very well-known and well-regarded British and American television comedy series. Fantozzi, however, never made it to English-speaking shores. While it is likely we will never know the success the franchise could have had, this article shows that it had every possibility of being a success.","[{""name"": ""Rory McKenzie"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122923111 Victoria University of Wellington""]}]","[""10.18352/incontri.9874"", ""10.1177/0022009405051555"", ""10.1386/jicms_00064_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'General Arts and Humanities']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7038), ('1301 艺术学', 0.7023)]]"

Recent studies of CVR concepts and components have laid the ground for a CVR narrative theoretical framework that might assist researchers and practitioners to understand this type of virtual reality (VR) experience. While existing studies have isolated key features of CVR, a range of projects from different fields of work or in different stages of production have utilized a range of different screenwriting processes and strategies to address the affordances of this medium. In this article we seek to systematize the key findings of earlier studies into a narrative framework for CVR and to analyse how this framework is reflected in existent models and templates for writing a screenplay for CVR experiences. Furthermore, and based on this narrative framework, we also aim to contribute an exploratory approach to CVR screenwriting by proposing a variative and original screenwriting template. This template addresses the main limitations of the existent screenwriting templates and formats that we analyse in this study while also summoning the main advantages.","[{""name"": ""Pedro Alves"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000010410653X Universidade Católica Portuguesa""]}, {""name"": ""Jose Luis Rubio-Tamayo"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122065938 Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid""]}, {""name"": ""Estefany DurAn-Fonseca"", ""affiliation"": [""Cuarta Pared VR""]}]","[""10.1080/15358593.2021.1881610"", ""10.1080/17503175.2017.1387357"", ""10.1386/josc.9.2.175_1"", ""10.1177/1555412010364982"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2015.09.006"", ""10.1386/josc.9.1.73_1"", ""10.1007/s10055-003-0114-9"", ""10.1080/14682753.2017.1305838"", ""10.1386/josc.10.1.3_1"", ""10.1386/josc.9.2.191_1"", ""10.7195/ri14.v14i2.965"", ""10.1353/sub.1999.0015"", ""10.1007/s10055-017-0305-4"", ""10.3389/frvir.2021.798306"", ""10.1109/TPC.2022.3228022"", ""10.1177/1329878X211018476""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Control and Systems Engineering', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

These climate and environmental security discourses have been extensively critiqued on both empirical and normative grounds. But is there an ethically defensible and even emancipatory alternative to envisioning the relationship between the environment and security? Matt McDonald in his new book - Ecological Security: Climate Change and the Construction of Security - argues that there is and lays out comprehensive normative framework for doing so. To interrogate McDonald's case for what he calls “Ecological Security”, this forum brings together four leading researchers from Anthropology, Geography, International Relations, and Peace and Sustainability Studies. While all contributors are broadly positive regarding goals of the book, each identifies weaknesses in the approach that move from suggestions on how refine the framework on the one hand to questioning whether the framework risks proving counter-productive on the other.","[{""name"": ""Paul Beaumont"", ""affiliation"": [""Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, Fagerstrand, Akershus, Norway""]}]","[""10.1177/13540661221142179"", ""10.1093/isr/viac055"", ""10.1177/0022343308096158"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198816959.013.15"", ""10.1016/j.esg.2021.100107"", ""10.1057/s41311-020-00247-3"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2013.01.002"", ""10.1017/S0260210522000249"", ""10.1093/ia/iiac229"", ""10.1007/s11625-020-00853-3"", ""10.1093/ia/iiz248"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2019.07.040"", ""10.1080/14650045.2014.913028"", ""10.1177/0022343320984210"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2021.102497"", ""10.1353/arc.2011.0071""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1386/ac_00050_2,ASIAN CINEMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Introduction: Hong Kong independent documentaries and their visibility,"In their general introduction to the present Special Issue the authors trace the origins of and motivation behind much of the independent documentary filmmaking produced in the city during a period of great sociopolitical turbulence, leading up to the tight censorship protocols put in place after the mainland government’s promulgation of the repressive National Security Law in 2020. With reference to the individual essays that comprise this volume, they chart the sudden and unprecedented rise of documentary filmmaking in Hong Kong following many decades of public indifference to the genre. Limited public and underground screenings that took place before absolute censorship measures were implemented in 2021 showed huge box-office demand for these topical films, reflecting images of ordinary Hong Kong people and their struggle for political representation. This opening essay introduces a range of essays and one interview, mostly in relation to specific films, dealing with the now-contentious coupling of documentary films or television broadcasts and democracy. As the essays indicate, some directors and producers of these observational and participatory documentaries are still active overseas and many of the films discussed can now only be screened outside Hong Kong. Nevertheless, they bear witness to a spirit of resilience and resistance as well as a deep-seated desire for a genuine democracy based on universal suffrage constantly reneged on by the city’s various rulers, from the colonial era until now.","[{""name"": ""Mike Ingham"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419370482 The Chinese University of Hong Kong""]}, {""name"": ""Kenny K.

In many ways, adaptation, which generates new versions and new readings of old texts instead of cancelling, erasing, or unpublishing them, offers the possibility of transcending the conflicts in contemporary culture. But the creation and the study of adaptations offer not a retreat from the culture wars but an array of new tools for waging them more productively by reframing them in ways that lead to more open and fruitful dialogue on the subjects proposed by the essays in this issue: theatrical performances cast for the public good, the costs of performing adapted versions of oneself or of encouraging adaptation-induced tourism, the ecological implications of adaptation, and the shifting valence of adaptation when it is practiced by public figures and posthuman agents.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Leitch"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, University of Delaware, USA""]}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Rosi’s cinema can be situated in the context of observational cinema, and like other filmmakers working in this vein, he focuses his camera on human subjects who we come to know across his films’ duration. In Below Sea Level (2009), Rosi focuses on the lives of people living marginal existences, on the edges of society, in a desert in southern California. These people disclose themselves (and are disclosed by Rosi’s shooting and editing) in an elliptical fashion that frustrates the desire for complete knowledge about their lives. In this method of intimate disclosure, in which there is a refusal to coax reassuring certainties from the people encountered in making this film, Rosi demonstrates the possibility of a humanist documentary cinema, insofar as ‘human’ in ‘humanist’ refers to an unpredictable becoming.","[{""name"": ""John David Rhodes"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121885934 University of Cambridge""]}]","[""10.1093/screen/16.2.91"", ""10.1386/jicms_00137_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

While these borderscapes become what Achille Mbembe refers to as death worlds, refugee cityscapes turn into Fanonian zones-of-nonbeing. The play The Jungle (2017) by Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson, the ensuing travelling festival The Walk (2021) featuring the performative journey of the refugee girl Little Amal, and the play Lampedusa (2015) by Anders Lustgarten engage with these necrogeographies and the way in which refugees and migrants are exposed to necropower in these spaces of ontological negation. This article maps how the refugee camp builds on colonial practices of citizenship and racialisation extended to the biopolitical city, delineating the interrelation of cities and borders through necropower. It also discusses the refugee camp as necrocity and necrocitizenship while exploring theatre as a means of transgressing colonial racial capitalist (b)order in the city in the three migration performances.

These pieces, and others like them, depict, and critically reflect upon, a world pervasively mediated by interfaces: the apps, social media platforms, and device operating systems that screen so much of our everyday experience and personal communication and distil them to data, both for our own self-tracking and for the scrutiny of corporations and state surveillance. All three works act as transducers: they create theatrical microcosms of the processes by which human life gets transformed into data, allowing spectators to momentarily assume the perspectives of a surveilling algorithm. We offer the term interface theatre as a means of adding nuance and texture to current discourses about theatre in the digital world, which can encompass so many different forms, practices, and politics that greater specificity is required. Equally importantly, we argue, works of interface theatre make a strong case for the necessity for the theatrical form itself as a medium through which to grapple with the role of interfaces in social and political life writ large.","[{""name"": ""Miriam Felton-Dansky"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jacob Gallagher-Ross"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/01610775-4250942"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479888702.001.0001"", ""10.1215/01610775-3547683"", ""10.22233/20412495.0422.28"", ""10.1215/01610775-3547695"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9919.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1461444810365313"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479833641.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1461444820910505"", ""10.1177/1461444812465139"", ""10.1353/tj.2021.0067""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

10.1093/adaptation/apad021,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Intangibility and Selfhood: Westworld as Allegory for Adaptation in the Digital Age,"Abstract Despite the digital becoming ever more ubiquitous, the physical matters more than ever. We see this in interviews with actors who voice animated characters, actors who voice computer generated imagery (CGI) characters, and actors who voice other non-human characters. Many things present a challenge to the ways in which we understand the physical—the structures of meaning in the world primarily, along with the specific filmic ways we understand star bodies. These combine to create barriers to ‘seeing’ the truth of a character we might think, but this is fixated on an approach that privileges a hierarchy of actors over character. Equally, it is one that privileges body over character. The recent series of Westworld begins to challenge this, thinking about the ways in which while the physical may be required, audiences are able to think beyond it. It functions as a way to consider the digital adaptation of the self, and the return to the needs of the physical to express character. Ultimately, this article argues that although we cannot escape the physical, the hierarchies and boundaries we have in place for understanding the truth of the self remain as unfixed as ever, despite the recourse to adapting through non-physical means.","[{""name"": ""Christina Wilkins"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Birmingham , UK""]}]","[""10.4324/9780203499627"", ""10.4324/9781315690254-37"", ""10.29333/ojcmt/5765"", ""10.1215/10407391-2006-025"", ""10.4324/9781315690254-5"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226321370.001.0001"", ""10.5749/j.cttts6mg"", ""10.1002/9781119437932.ch6"", ""10.1177/1357034X95001003009"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.1353/tj.2014.0125"", ""10.4324/9781315745664-21"", ""10.17646/KOME.2017.16"", ""10.1515/9783110272239.70"", ""10.1177/1357034X95001003012"", ""10.1353/cj.2015.0058""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"
10.7146/nts.v32i2.124357,NORDIC THEATRE STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Inside Frozen Geographie Baltic-Russian Theatre Exchanges after 2014,"After the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by the Russian Federation in 2014, the attitude of Baltic theatre producers and artists towards cultural and institutional partnerships with Russian theatres and their involvement in the mutual artistic exchanges, tours, common projects, and networking changed; not only due to these exchanges becoming a controversial issue in the public eye, but also due to the polarization they caused in the artistic community itself. Some artists, like Latvian stage director Alvis Hermanis, have decisively terminated all their previous creative partnerships, arrangements and tours, calling also other theatre artists “to take sides”. Others, like Russian stage and film director Kirill Serebrennikov who, for years, had been involved with Baltic theatres, would regard taking sides as a disastrous yielding of culture to the logic of war – theatre should be kept as the last link between societies gradually separated by reciprocal propaganda insanity. Building upon these conflicts describing the changes in intercultural theatrical cooperation between Russian and Baltic theatres, the article focuses on the analysis of three productions: Dreams of Rainis by Kirill Serebrennikov at the Latvian National Theatre (2015), Alexander Pushkin’s play Boris Godunov directed by Eimuntas Nekrošius at the Lithuanian National Drama Theatre (2015) and Brodsky/Baryshnikov staged by Alvis Hermanis at the New Riga Theatre in 2016. All of the performances refused to stay inside the frameworks marked for them by the regimes of propaganda wars, public diplomacy, or dispositif of security, but focused instead on the possibilities of intellectual disobedience.","[{""name"": ""Edgaras Klivis"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

These formal structures lack effectiveness and support, with informal, often non-democratic political processes and secret agreements continuing to prevail. The study aims to conclude a theoretical study, conceptualization, and generalization of the problems of the existence of informal institutions, as well as a comprehensive analysis of practical technologies of informal institutionalization in modern Ukraine. The authors used such general scientific methods as analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, abstraction, the ascent from the abstract to the concrete. The authors considered such informal institutions that exist in the political reality of Ukraine, such as lobbying, corruption, populism, non-conventional forms of political participation of citizens, party agreements, clientelism, and political bargaining. The effective technologies for the informal institutionalization of modern Ukraine, including technologies for eliminating authoritarian practices, technologies of party structuring, technologies of political participation and technologies for the formation of democratic political consciousness have been proposed. These technologies are aimed at the political modernization of Ukraine, ensuring the institutional functioning of democracy at the proper level and minimizing the negative effects of informal institutions.","[{""name"": ""Vira Haponenko"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Technologies, Kyiv National Economic University Named After Vadym Hetman, Kyiv, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Volodymyr Rykhlik"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Technologies, Kyiv National Economic University Named After Vadym Hetman, Kyiv, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Marina Shulga"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Public Administration, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Kyiv, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Svitlana Bulbeniuk"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Technologies, Kyiv National Economic University Named After Vadym Hetman, Kyiv, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Olha Naumenko"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Technologies, Kyiv National Economic University Named After Vadym Hetman, Kyiv, Ukraine""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-94012-6"", ""10.1177/0952076720904991"", ""10.59861/ansgk.2353-8392.2021.pp65-74"", ""10.1002/9780470674871.wbespm066.pub2"", ""10.1007/s11115-018-00433-1"", ""10.56021/9780801883514"", ""10.31235/osf.io/q8xbh"", ""10.31558/2519-2949.2018.1.9"", ""10.5129/001041519X15624348215945"", ""10.1353/reg.2018.0017"", ""10.17976/jpps/2018.01.07"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808678"", ""10.31558/2519-2949.2018.1.14"", ""10.1177/09520767211069199"", ""10.31548/law2022.01.010"", ""10.32518/2617-4162-2022-5-4-9-17"", ""10.1017/gov.2018.30"", ""10.1007/s11558-020-09382-1"", ""10.1007/978-981-19-0276-5_1"", ""10.37547/supsci-ojhpl-02-02-31""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'General Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)]]"

Infoautopoiesis makes the external environment meaningful to the organism, so it can mould it in its own image to satisfy its needs, and be moulded in turn. Self-created internalised semantic information results from interpreting environmental sensory signals as “differences which make a difference”. The content of individuated, inaccessible internalised semantic information may be translated into externalised syntactic expressions that comprise outward artificial expressions that lack semantic content. Yet, despite our ability for creation of sophisticated syntactic information, we are unable to make them produce semantic information. In short, infoautopoiesis is fundamental to translation at any level.","[{""name"": ""Jaime F.

10.1215/02705346-9561423,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Incestuous Wanderlust: 35 Shots of Rum's Atmospheres of Circulation,"Abstract Claire Denis's films have long been associated with enveloping moods. This essay focuses on how atmospheres in her film, 35 Shots of Rum (35 Rhums, France/Germany, 2008), possess a unique conceptual valence within her work. As a “rethinking” of Yasujirō Ozu's Late Spring (Banshun, Japan, 1949), the film's narrative premise traces the strong bond between a widower and his adult daughter. Most critical assessments of the film thus interpret 35 Shots of Rum as an homage to Ozu, seeing the daughter's love for her father as a reflection of Denis's devotion to the Japanese director. However, this essay moves beyond a cursory reading of Denis's film as a celebration of paternal legacies, arguing that its atmospheric textures—the phantasmatic movement of its intertexts, the resonance of its rhythmic editing, or the vague force of its enigmatic gestures—express a critique of gendered and neocolonial norms determining recognition and value within world cinema. Atmosphere also thematizes that which resists full disclosure, such as the unrealized but looming possibility of incestuous desire haunting Late Spring and Denis's oeuvre. Incest's equivocal, ambiguous, but potentially felt presence in 35 Shots also extends to multiple extradiegetic allusions the film pursues with a casual commitment—what this article calls the film's loitering cadence—an endless flirtation with various artistic forefathers that undermines patrilinear genealogy as a unified or coherent origin. Through these critical coordinates, 35 Shots of Rum emerges as a cartography for imagining alternative modes of transnational circulation and descent in world cinema.","[{""name"": ""Iggy Cortez"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Cultural Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.2478/ausfm-2022-0004,ACTA UNIVERSITATIS SAPIENTIAE-FILM AND MEDIA STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,In the Captivity of the Present. Approaches to Son of Saul by Laszlo Nemes Jeles,"Abstract Son of Saul, the Hungarian director, László Nemes Jeles’s film about Holocaust was released in 2015 with great international success: Grand Prix of the Cannes Film Festival, the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best foreign-language film. In my essay, I approach the film from a variety of perspectives. First, by analysing the visual and aural level of the film I intend to show how – in a very original way – Son of Saul is capable of depicting the understandably limited perspective and numb state of mind of the protagonist, a member of the Sonderkommando. In the second section, I compare Son of Saul with the Nobel Prize winner novel, Fatelessness (1975) by Imre Kertész. I argue that these two works show strong similarity in their storytelling and staging of the Holocaust. Both works miss a looking back in hindsight and the historical perspective, confining their protagonists to the present. Thirdly, I examine the relation between the absurd mission of Saul saving the dead boy and the problem of remembering and commemorating the Holocaust. Finally, I try to map the traces of popular genres in Son of Saul. I recon the film applies – on the one hand – the audiovisual techniques of the POV-horror genre while – on the other hand – the media and presentation tactics of first-person-shooter video games. The application of well-known media procedures can thus bring the historical event that can be hardly visualized or verbalized closer to the younger generation. With the Holocaust fading away in the past and the number of survivors and witnesses radically decreasing, this is certainly becoming more and more important.","[{""name"": ""Miklós Sághy"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Szeged ( Hungary )""]}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198159216.003.0005"", ""10.1086/710912"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1198x4c"", ""10.1093/screen/40.2.146"", ""10.1515/ausfm-2016-0017""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

This paper takes up this question through an examination of Simon Stone's production of The Wild Duck ‘after Ibsen’, staged at Belvoir Theatre in Sydney in 2011, and the late Mark Fisher's (2009) theorization of a market-dominated present as capitalist realism. In doing so, it refers to three different cultural contexts by making parallels to the German theatre director Thomas Ostermeier's work and pointing to developments in Britain. It argues that performances dependent upon the subject's capacity to know and represent the world are predicated on a subjective response and therefore risk locating systemic issues in the closed fictional cosmos of situational dramatic art as part of its exploration of the paralysis intrinsic to the capitalist realist politics of (theatre) spectatorship.","[{""name"": ""MARGARET HAMILTON"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

As the journal commemorates its achievements over its first seventy-five volumes, this essay reflects on the vital contributions of the performance review section by considering its enduring impact on the field. In addition to tracing the evolution of the section from its earliest days as a single-authored article highlighting productions from the Broadway season to its current iteration, the essay argues that performance reviews have afforded authors crucial opportunities to hone their critical voices and vocabularies. It further contends that, even as performance reviews have been instrumental in introducing the journal’s readers to artists and events that they might not have otherwise known about, the influence of the section has also manifested in more practical ways. For example, it has been key in cultivating a pipeline of editors, thereby shaping how we think, read, and write about drama, theatre, and performance critically. Central to the essay is a consideration of the meaningful ways that the performance review section has advanced and enhanced the journal’s rich legacy of accomplishments.","[{""name"": ""Isaiah Matthew Wooden"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

I first draw on previous criticism on postcolonial neo-Victorianism and turn-of-the-century American passing novels in order to analyze Carnival Row’s contradictory revision of imperial London through its re-imagining in a fictional city named The Burgue. I then explore the conflicting ways in which the series tackles (neo-)imperialism and colonialization, as it simultaneously criticizes and reproduces imperial ideologies and stereotypes of the racial Other. Finally, I argue that Carnival Row seems to offer a new take on American passing novels by allowing Philo, the mixed-race male protagonist, to embrace his biracial nature without meeting a tragic fate at the end of Season 1. Nonetheless, by choosing a White actor (Orlando Bloom) to play the role of the passer, the series culturally appropriates a form of Black oppression for the entertainment of a White audience. Thus, despite the series’ well-intentioned attempts to criticize (neo-)imperial, racist, and xenophobic practices, it ultimately perpetuates—rather than subverts—those very same ideologies.","[{""name"": ""Dina Pedro"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English and German, School of Philology, Translation and Communication, Universitat de Valencia , Office 54, 6th Floor, 32 Blasco Ibáñez Avenue, 46010 Valencia , Spain""]}]","[""10.1017/9781108275439"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521872171"", ""10.1057/9780230317499"", ""10.1093/melus/30.1.19"", ""10.5323/jafriamerhist.99.3.0173"", ""10.1057/9781137316721"", ""10.1111/lic3.12463"", ""10.1163/9789401208963_002"", ""10.2307/202667"", ""10.1111/criq.12035"", ""10.35360/njes.389"", ""10.3366/gothic.2020.0064"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64559-9""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

AoJE employs the powers of social media to create a modernized and fully-fledged storyworld, yet the users’ overall experience is undermined by the very strategies meant to facilitate engaged interactivity. When social media posts become sites where users not only actively seek additional content but also ‘read’ traces of other users’ interactions with the content, those traces function as paratextual commentary, creating dialogic metaphors. In AoJE, the characters’ social media accounts demand that users remain in a near constant state of metalepsis by accepting and even inverting several previously accepted ontological binaries: character/actor, reader/writer, passive/active, immersive/interactive. The effort required by users to interact successfully with the various platforms additionally underscores the difficulty of consuming (and prosuming) a story that unfolds over multiple platforms, especially once the social media components no longer exist in the immediate present.","[{""name"": ""Kate Faber Oestreich"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780197511176.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1367877915605887"", ""10.1353/book.3302"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1d9nkdg.16"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apq010"", ""10.1177/1470412920906253"", ""10.1215/03335372-23-4-581"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198871071.003.0004""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Contrary to deterministic and structural approaches, I argue for the consideration of how specific events and practices articulate film censorship in Singapore in specific ways and how these, in turn, feed back into the process of censorship. Using the case study of Ken Kwek’s Sex.Violence.FamilyValues (2012), this article problematizes idealistic representations of the censorship system as an efficient machine made up of separate components with clearly defined functions. It finds instead that the complex agency based on contingent relations and identities make any form of overall structure in film censorship impossible.

After the cessation of theatre censorship in 1988, cultural influences in repertoire shifted from East to West, allowing for the exploration of once-taboo subjects like gender and sexuality. This fostered modern queer theatre, that embraces LGBTQ+ themes, characters, and aesthetics. Estonian queer theatre quickly evolved from portraying dandy figures and gay heroes to transgender and drag characters. It embraced various styles from psychological realism to documentary, devised, and physical theatre.This paper explores queer elements within Estonian theatre, set against the backdrop of Western queer theatre history. It focuses on the last decades, examining how queer theatre functioned as a litmus test of democracy and challenged post-Soviet norms from a cultural research perspective. Grounded in basic research of stage messages and media reception, it reflects societal attitudes and the trauma of social change. Throughout the history of Estonian theatre, queer themes have appeared in over a hundred productions, resonating in more than five hundred reviews and attracting an estimated one million theatre visits in a country of 1.3 million.

10.3138/md-65-3-1222,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Ibsen Postcards/Postcard Ibsens: Domesticating Modernism,"Playwright Henrik Ibsen was featured on countless postcards during the postcard craze of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Encompassing photographic portraits, snapshots, sculptures, monuments, etchings, paintings, and caricatures, the historical interest of these postcards arises not simply from the range of images of the playwright they featured but from the quantity of cards that were published and circulated, how the cards were used and by whom, and what their uses suggest about Ibsen’s popular reputation, reception, significance, impact, and reach. This essay considers the range of Ibsen postcards and also their uses, taking into account the messages inscribed on the cards, the senders and recipients, and the ways the postcards circulated as much as the Ibsen images themselves. In doing so, it considers how the postcards animate the singular figure of the iconic playwright they represent and collectively constitute a lively archive – print and manuscript, visual and textual – that conjures a variety of different Ibsens.

The hard body movies were characterized by having a reoccurring set of actors (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Van Damme) and themes (facing adversaries in a forceful manner), and some of the factors that influenced this portrayal were the Reagan Revolution and a revaluation of the Vietnam war. However, a change in political ideology, and a reassessment of America’s place in the world, inspired the deconstruction of those movies, and newer movies brought with them a new message, of what could be considered a soft body.","[{""name"": ""Moshe Machlev"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Hussain offered timely explorations of tradition, modernity and gender, and used the period’s generic conventions and stars to shape his unique visions. By positioning Hussain within the broader world of film entertainment, this chapter contributes to a more historically grounded perspective on the role played by film directors during the golden age of Malay cinema.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan Driskell"", ""affiliation"": [""Monash University Malaysia""]}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv7h0tcd"", ""10.1386/ac.13.2.9_1"", ""10.1163/22134379-90003703"", ""10.1355/9789812306517-011"", ""10.5367/000000009787586415"", ""10.1111/j.1754-9469.2012.01151.x"", ""10.59962/9780774853668"", ""10.17576/juum-2020-27-04"", ""10.1017/9789048505128""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In the wake of the destruction that results in the absence of humans, non-human residents begin the process of recuperation, and the ‘no-go zones’ become inadvertent sanctuaries for wild and abandoned domestic animals. Each of the following productions takes a different view of what occurs when both the norms of nature and the practices of human societies and economies are profoundly disrupted. In addition, one play has depicted a community exercising a new restraint to establish an intentional ‘no-go zone’ to ensure its own survival. When confronted with catastrophes that threaten the existence of all life, as well as the surprising possibilities of renewal, dramatists employ heightened poetic diction and resort to mythical precedents in the attempt to capture the immensity of both the event and its aftermath.","[{""name"": ""CATHERINE DIAMOND"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7551/mitpress/11638.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14688417.2016.1192000"", ""10.1111/j.1467-954X.2009.01817.x"", ""10.1353/dtc.2016.0007""]","['Social Sciences', 'Environmental Science', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Geography, Planning and Development', 'Nature and Landscape Conservation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)]]"

In this article we create new insights into the ways in which these screenwriters have developed scripts for films that have made a mark on the world stage. To this end we will investigate how this acclaim has been enabled by their screenwriting decisions which focus on the creation of women-centred films, as well as their use of the family story as a means of exploring contemporary social and political themes, to tell universal stories that highlight the global in the local. In doing so we canvas the personal, industrial and social factors which have impacted Martel, Muylaert and Llosa’s screenwriting careers which have been instrumental in the script development of the films: La Ciénaga (The Swamp) (Martel 2001); Que Horas Ela Volta? (The Second Mother) (); and La Teta Asustada (The Milk of Sorrow) (). The research for this article is based on personal and media interviews with the writers, as well as contemporary information available only in Spanish and Portuguese, as translated from the original Spanish and Portuguese by Clarissa Miranda.","[{""name"": ""Margaret McVeigh"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404375432 Griffith University""]}, {""name"": ""Clarissa Mazon Miranda"", ""affiliation"": [""Antonio Meneghetti Faculdade""]}]","[""10.1386/josc_00037_1""]","['Psychology', 'Computer Science', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Museology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

After briefly examining the theatres’ histories and the historiography of their place in theatre history, we then analyse the details of the Olimpico's and Slottsteater's ‘performances’ in the following characteristics: how their distinctive features employ motion and space, the presence of their silent ghost audiences, their similarities as one-room theatres and in the ‘democratic nature’ of their auditoriums, and their use of trompe l'oeil in their construction. Through these elements, the Teatro Olimpico and Drottningholm Slottsteater perform their pasts, achieving their status as iconic playhouses that still make an impact on audiences and visitors.

Audiences' experiences of meditation, obsession and authenticity when watching swimming moose on Swedish television","This article explores viewers’ experiences of the Swedish Public Service (SVT) ‘slow TV’ broadcast Den stora älgvandringen (The Great Moose Migration), aired as a three-week long, live, multi-platform programme since 2019. Through semi-structured interviews with key informants, the aim is to qualitatively understand the audience attraction to the 24/7 programme, especially when it comes to authenticity, affordances and its apparent slowness of pace. The study showcases a spectrum of audiences’ experiences, ranging from appreciating the programme’s serenity and stillness to its potential for unexpected drama. It is suggested that The Great Moose Migration offers a ‘direct’ link to Swedish nature as it enables a wallowing in Swedish landscapes and fauna, and allows for an unashamed adoration of the majestic Swedish moose, but without it being experienced as something particularly ‘Swedish’. It is found that authenticity is central to the programme’s success with both production team and audiences. However, both personal and sociable experiences of the programme as authentic rest on the collective acceptance of authenticity as something intrinsically produced by people and technologies yet not experienced as constructed. Rather, it is something that hovers in between experienced mediated and unmediated reality.","[{""name"": ""Åsa Kroon"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107388966 Örebro University""]}, {""name"": ""Johan Nilsson"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107388966 Örebro University""]}]","[""10.1080/2159676X.2019.1628806"", ""10.1177/1468796819843531"", ""10.1177/17496020221087111"", ""10.1080/01439685.2021.1907677"", ""10.1080/14443058.2020.1867223"", ""10.1386/jsca_00033_1"", ""10.1386/jmpr.14.2.129_1"", ""10.1002/pan3.10281"", ""10.1177/1461445601003004004"", ""10.18261/issn.0805-9535-2018-02-03"", ""10.1177/1461445601003004005"", ""10.4135/9781446221587.n6"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edk007"", ""10.1080/17405904.2010.511834"", ""10.1177/1461445601003004003""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Communication', 'Gender Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

Regarding Twitter, we downloaded tweets containing ‘climate change AND Africa’ or ‘climate change’ and the name of all 54 African countries, identified who was tweeting and what they were tweeting about. We also identified key African climate change activists and analysed their tweets. While the nature of mainstream media coverage varies across the top five countries, a slight shift towards articles focused on adaptation and mitigation was observed, away from purely disaster narratives.

10.3366/jobs.2022.0361,JOURNAL OF BECKETT STUDIES,0502 Foreign Language and Literature; 1303 Drama Film and Television,How It Was in Silling: Comment c'est and Les 120 journees de Sodome - An Intertextual Case Study,"This paper offers a comparative case study of Samuel Beckett's Comment c'est (1961)/ How It Is (1964) and the Marquis de Sade's 120 journées de Sodome (1799). How It Is contains one of the only two explicit mentions of the notion of ‘sadism’ in Beckett's œuvre, and a close reading of both ‘novels’ provides definitive evidence that this particular occurrence refers not merely to a vulgarised, generic notion of cruelty, but to Sade's text specifically, thus confirming the presence of a direct intertextual borrowing, and showing that Beckett was indeed rereading the 120 jounées (or his notes on Sade) while writing Comment c'est. This paper argues for a Sadean impact on the form, themes and aesthetics of Beckett's text by way of a comparative reading blending empirical and interpretative approaches, paying close attention to the narrative and fictional strategies at work in Beckett's reception of the Sadean universe. Maurice Blanchot's essay ‘La raison de Sade’ (1949), which Beckett knew well, is used as critical framework to interpret the Sadean dimension of Beckett's last ‘novel’. This allows for new insights into the writing of this difficult work and casts a great deal of light on the evolution of Beckett's exploration of violence and alterity.","[{""name"": ""Elsa Baroghel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7228/manchester/9780719071560.001.0001"", ""10.1215/0041462X-2009-2004"", ""10.1017/9781108284011"", ""10.1017/9781108771085""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

10.1215/02705346-8085147,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Horror Cities: Contesting the Ruins of Capitalism in Contemporary Genre Cinema,"In both art and politics, the deindustrialized city would seem to have taken on the qualities of the “unrepresentable,” a traumatic experience that can only be recorded by its attendant silence, or of depoliticized representation in genres such as “ruin porn.” Despite or perhaps because of this, the postindustrial city is ubiquitous within the genres of scifi/speculative, fantasy, and horror cinema, appearing consistently as backdrop, symbol, animus, and even in some cases, character. Given the wide literature on horror film, haunting, and traumatic memory, this article suggests we read the emergence of the “horror city” as a representation of the political unconscious of this historical conjuncture. Many films refer back to older mythologies of imperial and racial conquest, but also by doing so represent the symbol of modernity—the city—as travel back to a traumatic past. Yet within this return to history, there is a contest over allegory. Contrasting neoconservative narratives of films like The Road (dir. John Hillcoat, US, 2009) and the slasher film Hostel (dir. Eli Roth, US/Germany/Czech Republic/Slovakia/Iceland, 2005) suggests that the future has not vanished but rather has been spatially dislocated to the peripheries, as the modern site of production returns to inflict pain only on those unaware of its existence. And perhaps more radical still, two independent films, Vampz (dir. Steve Lustgarten, US, 2004) and Hood of the Living Dead (dir. Eduardo and Jose Quiroz, US, 2005), suggest that the abandoned city is still a site for the basic labor of human reproduction even as the infrastructure of full employment has vanished. As a counternarrative to both “ruin porn” and the “horror city,” these low-budget films offer the deindustrialized city as a site of mutuality and political contestation rather than a mystified object of horror and abjection.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Balthaser"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Cultural Studies', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

Often mistaken as holograms, these projections of images ranging from Tupac to Julian Assange to holographic protests redraw the boundaries between life and death, and enable a re-imagination of ghosts, deadness, aliveness and afterlife. The chapter argues for four different moments in a history of ghosts in the media: resurrection; necrophilia; necromancy; and interactivity. The last facilitates spectral life in the post-screen through considering holographic projections of both dead and living figures. In relation to the dead, the post-screen becomes a space in limbo between deadness and aliveness; in relation to the living, the realness of the holographic body stretches in a tetravalence across dual axes of actual/virtual and here/elsewhere, and enlivened in what I call vivification. In these 3D displays on the post-screen of resurrected and vivified bodies, different kinds of life, afterlife and after-death emerge.","[{""name"": ""Jenna Ng"", ""affiliation"": [""University of York, UK""]}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Looking at the widely shared image of a young woman holding a sign with the phrase at a rally in Texas, I discuss the communal charge of what I call tough girl affect—a politically saturated vibe, touting a notably youthful, right-wing femininity that is deliberately feisty, fun, and provocative, yet compliant with the hetero-patriarchal agenda of Trump’s neoliberal macho politics. I am interested in the way body and choice evoke white femininity as affective strategy, negotiating a public feeling of privileged belonging to the nation. The article works through the tenets of body, border, and nation as central to this investment, suggesting that the tough girl image mobilizes femininity to affectively strengthen conservatism, whiteness, and homeland in the face of the pandemic. Staging a fantasy of impunity, the tough girl intimates the invincible conservative body in opposition to the porous emotionality of feeble liberals. At the same time, the spectacle of white femininity necessarily fuels national fears of permeability and hence charges negative (even fatal) attachments to fantasmatic sovereignty. While mobilizing vulnerability to energize femininity, whiteness, and borders, the image ultimately exposes the compromised bargains of living and dying in (Trump’s) America.","[{""name"": ""Jenny Stümer"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Gender Studies', 'Pharmacy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1007 药学', 0.7325), ('1008 中药学', 0.7122)]]"

10.1093/adaptation/apaa035,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Hamlet Revision: Bhardwaj's Haider as Crossmapping and Contact Zone,"AbstractCompleting his trilogy of adaptations of Shakespearean tragedies, Indian director Vishal Bhardwaj’s film Haider (2014) tackles Hamlet. A generic fusion of realist drama, Bollywood movie, and espionage thriller, the film intersects the Elizabethan source text’s revenge plot with intertextual references to journalist Basharat Peer’s contemporary war memoir Curfewed Nights (2011), detailing the realities in insurgency-torn Kashmir in the 1990s. Taking its cue from the film’s controversial reception, which runs the gamut from censorship, appraisals, and criticism that Indian film does not need the ‘crutch’ of Hamlet to claim attention, this article explores questions about border-crossing, violence, and reconciliation raised on the level of form and content. Haider presents an adaptation of not one but two source texts: one ‘global’ and one ‘local’. The result, this article argues, is astonishingly harmonious and the contested metaphors of adaptation theory and global Shakespeare studies, such as ‘appropriation’ or ‘indigenization’, apply less to it than that of a transcultural ‘contact zone’ (Pratt, Mary Louise. Imperial Eyes. Travel Writing and Transculturation, 2nd. ed. London and New York: Routledge, 2008) and of a ‘crossmapping’ (Bronfen, Elisabeth. Crossmappings. On Visual Culture. London and New York: I.B. Tauris, 2018). By placing greater emphasis on communality and having the ending turn from revenge to forgiveness, Haider interrogates the transcultural appeal of Hamlet, drawing attention to histories of violent conflict. It also reveals a revisionist agenda that captures both hidden political realities and a haunting refiguration of Shakespeare.","[{""name"": ""Julia Hoydis"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English Studies, University of Graz""]}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199599103.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350985971"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511760211"", ""10.1353/shb.2016.0001"", ""10.5040/9781472539069"", ""10.4135/9781446270233"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198122272.001.0001"", ""10.1353/shq.2015.0002"", ""10.1080/23311983.2016.1260824"", ""10.4324/9780203181478-21"", ""10.1353/shb.2016.0041"", ""10.1080/02759527.2016.11933060"", ""10.4324/9781315168968"", ""10.4324/9781315670409""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

10.1386/jptv_00101_1,JOURNAL OF POPULAR TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,HIV prevention and the impact of It's a Sin in Scotland,"HIV prevention services across the United Kingdom received unprecedented requests for home testing kits following the airing of Russell T. Davies’s television series It’s a Sin (IAS) in January and February 2021. Professionals suggested a link between IAS’s retelling of AIDS crisis histories and people’s fears of ongoing HIV transmission, thus leading to increased online searches about HIV/AIDS. Little has been written about this impact of IAS on HIV health promotion practices specifically. Thus, in this article, I analyse a series of interviews with HIV health promoters in Scotland to detail how IAS has influenced HIV intervention techniques and health promotion strategies. I demonstrate how IAS provoked local and national dialogues about the contemporary context of HIV/AIDS in Scotland. I argue that it enabled conversations about the need for new media resources that accurately represent the specific and localized histories of HIV/AIDS. More directly, IAS in small part illuminated differences in intervention strategies between England and Scotland. Hence, it foregrounded the need for re-distributed institutional and material resources to streamline a Scottish agenda for ‘ending HIV’ by 2030.","[{""name"": ""Chase Ledin"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419367988 The University of Edinburgh""]}]","[""10.1016/S2352-3018(21)00047-3"", ""10.1080/13691058.2014.960003"", ""10.1177/001789690206100204"", ""10.4135/9781446282243.n20"", ""10.4135/9781446282243.n17"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033849"", ""10.1386/jptv_00101_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Medicine']","['Infectious Diseases', 'Epidemiology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7618), ('1001 基础医学', 0.732)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.3138/ctr.191.003,CANADIAN THEATRE REVIEW,1303 Drama Film and Television,HGTV's House Hunters and the Right to Coziness,"This article explores the complex appeal of home-buying and renovation shows on the cable channel HGTV. While their popularity is clear, their political implications are murkier. Some media studies scholars accuse the genre of fostering consumerism, conformity, and neo-liberal nationhood. Others admire its inclusion and “non-special treatment” of queer and racially diverse participants. My own feminist reading notes the limits as well as merits of the diversity defense and offers to appreciate the shows’ contribution in somewhat different terms. Focusing specifically on House Hunters (1999-present), I credit this home-buying series with asserting the primacy of domestic life in conjunction with a host of related values conventionally coded and subordinated as ‘feminine.’ In the hegemonic scheme of things, qualities coded as ‘masculine’ (the aggressive, historic, large-scale, public-sphere, self-reliant, and individualist) occupy a superior position. House Hunters challenges this gendered hierarchy by reveling in the modest, everyday, small-scale, private-sphere, interdependent, and relational. It does so, moreover, in a gender-neutral way: no longer written off and relegated to women, the little things that happen in houses are made paramount for male and female viewers alike. Adding a further twist, I close with an episode whose homebuyers have histories of social marginality and economic insecurity. In this context, the desire for domestic ‘coziness’ is less about conformity to bourgeois norms and more about feelings of safety and belonging in relation to place.","[{""name"": ""Susan Fraiman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1470412904044798"", ""10.7312/frai16634"", ""10.1080/10304310802189972"", ""10.5040/9780755695980"", ""10.1002/9781118599594.ch22"", ""10.1093/screen/41.3.299"", ""10.1080/10304310801982930"", ""10.5040/9780755695980.ch-012"", ""10.1177/1367877905052418"", ""10.1177/1527476412457079"", ""10.1002/9781118599594.ch21""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Communication', 'Gender Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

(Helping Essential workers Reclaim roles Online) Unmasking was a virtual drama therapy protocol designed to support frontline healthcare workers (re)connect to part of their humanity overshadowed by the role of the Healthcare Hero during the COVID-19 pandemic. The intervention, grounded in Role Theory, sought to provide immediate relief and meaning making through embodied storytelling. This pilot study utilized a quasi-experimental mixed methods design to measure the effect of the protocol. The Integration of Stressful Life Experiences Scale-Short Form was implemented. A dependent t-test did not yield statistical significance from pre-test (17.26) to post-test (20.47), although a medium effect size (0.64) was found. Post-test scores suggested that participants demonstrated more adaptive meaning making after the workshop. A small sample size (n = 19) likely impacted the ability to find statistical significance. Qualitative results produced prominent themes of transformation, connection and joy. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Amanda Rothman"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Scholar""]}, {""name"": ""Elena Offerman"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Scholar""]}, {""name"": ""Dana George Trottier"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368753 New York University""]}]","[""10.1386/dtr_00039_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00013_1"", ""10.1386/dtr.3.2.285_1"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2014.07.003"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30078-X"", ""10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.11.011"", ""10.1386/dtr_00034_1"", ""10.1037/amp0000693"", ""10.1097/NCM.0000000000000559"", ""10.1177/0033354920965266"", ""10.1097/01.JAA.0000669772.78848.8c"", ""10.1386/dtr_00044_1"", ""10.1037/a0020892"", ""10.1080/07481187.2013.829369"", ""10.1386/jaah.1.1.7/1"", ""10.1186/s12888-021-03261-8"", ""10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.03.024"", ""10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.08.013"", ""10.1037/cou0000370"", ""10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113441"", ""10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.026"", ""10.1037/a0018301"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2006.03.001"", ""10.1386/dtr_00046_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00016_1"", ""10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.04.057"", ""10.1386/dtr_00051_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00035_1"", ""10.1386/dtr.4.2.223_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00025_1"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.056"", ""10.1386/dtr_00107_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Conservation', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally disrupted our ability to share space. Spatial copresence, it turns out, is what the coronavirus requires to spread. The virus, in this sense, is a phenomenon of the live.

With the creation of a new “disquisitory” form, Shaw provides an analogue to Ibsen’s Ghosts. In Getting Married, Shaw dramatizes one long discussion on the status of marriage and the necessity for liberalizing divorce laws. Central in the loose narrative are three distinct “New Women,” repudiating their duty to Victorian idealism and providing a snapshot of the myriad outcomes for women facing the same problem as Ghosts’s Mrs. Alving. In its dramaturgical construction and underlying theme, Getting Married can be seen as response to the Alving’s terrible marriage in Ibsen’s Ghosts. Lesbia Grantham, Mrs. George Collins, and Edith Bridgenorth function as the potential future iterations of Helene Alving. Getting Married responds, reimagines, and redresses through discourse and dramaturgy a potential world and a potential marriage contract for women that Ibsen’s dramatic plotting excises.","[{""name"": ""Justine Zapin"", ""affiliation"": [""University College Dublin—National University of Ireland""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Medicine']","['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Challenging the Anthropocene through Nomadic Performativity,"In this article I will discuss David O’Reilly’s video game Everything (2017), suggesting that its unique dramaturgy portrays an ecology in which the human is seen as forging alliances and interconnections with the non-human. Set in a seemingly infinite open-world environment, the game revolves around the player exploring vast digital landscapes from the vantage point of multiple nonhuman avatars. Wondering about with no defined goal or direction, I played as animals, plants, rocks, continents, and even galaxies, shifting from one state to the next and making unexpected alliances along the way. Employing Audronė Žukauskaitė concept of “nomadic performativity” (2015), I will suggest that the game’s dramaturgy invites the player to imagine the human as deeply embedded in a wide system of interaction with non-human others, as an immanent part of an ecosystem, rather than a transcendental being outside of it. In articulating this idea, Everything puts forward a theatrical critique of thehuman domination and othering of the natural environment that underpins and drives the Anthropocene.","[{""name"": ""Vlad Butucea"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Computer Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1386/ac_00064_1,ASIAN CINEMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Games of love and lust: Performance, masquerade and trauma in Lust, Caution and The Handmaiden","This article analyses Ang Lee’s Lust, Caution (2007) and Park Chan-Wook’s The Handmaiden (2016) as melodramas which foreground trauma as a deadlock of identity. In both films, trauma exposes cultural and social consequences of national betrayal and colonial hierarchies, drawing our attention to politically charged predicament of suspended agency. At the same time, in both Lust, Caution and The Handmaiden, trauma as the ‘affective bearing’ also becomes significant with regard to how the spectator understands the expressed, cinematic world. This affective bearing is not a quality ‘attached’ to the film externally, but it is immanent to its aesthetic-expressive specificity which evokes direct emotional engagement in the spectator. The trauma examined in this article in both Lust, Caution and The Handmaiden bears less resemblance to attempts of representing national traumas than to matters of affective intensities experienced and understood organically from within the cinematic experience. This focus on trauma makes both films universally accessible insofar as it demonstrates not only what cinema can represent, but also what cinema can do: by means of its affective bearing a film can directly engage the spectators’ emotion in a way that alters their cinematic experience.","[{""name"": ""Tarja Laine"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000084992262 University of Amsterdam""]}]","[""10.1177/0305829809103241"", ""10.1386/jcc.3.2.177_1"", ""10.1037/amp0000442"", ""10.1177/0263276410372238"", ""10.2307/1225690"", ""10.1093/screen/16.3.6"", ""10.1080/17564905.2018.1520781"", ""10.1093/screen/hjs007"", ""10.1037/0736-9735.20.1.158"", ""10.3366/vic.2019.0354"", ""10.2307/1212758"", ""10.1007/s10912-020-09622-w"", ""10.1386/ac_00064_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Exterminate All the Brutes is an effort to make visible and audible the forgotten and unspeakable about the West: that its basic, winning practices are white supremacy, colonialism, and genocidal extermination. Peck’s new opus is a critical interrogation of the West and the Western cinematic and image archive. The film functions as both rebuke and “counter testimony,” building out in vision of a global black film archive. Ultimately, Peck’s four-part documentary encourages viewers to think through cinema about the West critically and models the use of documentary filmmaking as a practice of freedom.","[{""name"": ""Walton Muyumba"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Seemingly, he is a now a mellowed national treasure due largely to his approachable, friendly, prolific series of travelogues, Great British Railway Journeys (2010–present). This multi-series documentary has been a remarkable BBC success: delivering upbeat music, dynamic camera work, a repetitive format, rosy-tinted Victoriana and celebratory subject matter, the programme makers ensure that the programme is feel-good, cosy, nostalgic and soothing. But Portillo’s political inclinations are apparent: Portillo, sometimes quite subtly, expresses consistently his passion for free enterprise, for the supposed benefits of historical colonialism, for the monarchy, for the military and for social liberalism. A believer in an enterprise-encouraging small state and in personal liberty and social mobility, Portillo’s politics chime in directly with the current thinking of the Conservative Party leadership. In short, the apparently benign travelogue series promotes Portillo’s mainstream post-Thatcherite British Conservatism: an analysis of the ubiquitous programme’s understated but clear Conservatism counters right-wing accusations about the BBC’s alleged leftist bias.","[{""name"": ""Kevin De Ornellas"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000105519715 Ulster University""]}]","[""10.1007/BF00160017"", ""10.1386/jptv_00053_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1386/smt_00070_1,STUDIES IN MUSICAL THEATRE,1303 Drama Film and Television,From Heathers to Six: Stealth musicals and the TikTok Broadway archive,"This article explores two popular TikTok trends that use sound bites from the original cast recordings of Heathers: The Musical and Six. The ‘Martha Dumptruck in the Flesh’ challenge from Heathers: The Musical and the ‘Yeah That Didn’t Work Out’ challenge from Six were, by and large, completely detached from the musicals. TikTokers who engaged with these trends, therefore, likely did not even know that the sound bites came from musicals. These musicals became what I term ‘stealth musicals’, or undercover musicals that proliferate on TikTok in ways that are completely removed from the show’s dramaturgy. As stealth musicals, Heathers: The Musical and Six did not just go viral but stayed viral on TikTok. I argue, therefore, that these two musicals became canonical pieces of Gen Z culture. With viral canonization, Heathers: The Musical and Six demonstrate how cultural capital accrues in digital spaces and, as a result, sound bites such as ‘Martha Dumptruck in the flesh’ enter into a public life that extends beyond the musicals themselves. Indeed, as I propose, quoting ‘Martha Dumptruck in the flesh’ is as synonymous with Gen Z culture as it is with the musical Heathers.","[{""name"": ""Trevor Boffone"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000415699707 University of Houston""]}]","[""10.1386/smt_00028_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64876-7_1"", ""10.1177/1367549420945341"", ""10.1386/smt_00070_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Gender Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"
10.30628/1994-9529-2021-17.4-11-30,NAUKA TELEVIDENIYA-THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,From Gilles Deleuze's Analysis of Dynamic Images to the Exploration of the Visuality of Serious Computer Games,"Computer games involve a rich visual environment, which is usually associated with a fascinating pastime. But what about the visuality of games aimed at solving deep social, scientific, civil problems, where gaming pleasure should be realized along with the achievement of non-game goals? According to the concept of procedural rhetoric (Ian Bogost), any game convinces a person, through simulated situations, to make decisions and take subsequent actions. In the authors’ opinion, images in games work in the same way for proceduralism and support of player’s actions. To illustrate the scientific discussions about the engaging visuality of computer games, the article reviews publications on the topic (Graeme Kirkpatrick, Paul Atkinson and Farzad Parsayi, Asaf Friedman). Further, the authors offer an image classification for the visual content analysis, which takes into account the stimulating role of images in overcoming game challenges and gaining control over the game world. According to this classification, the visual component of a computer game may contain the following images: image-action; image-perception; imageemotion; image-development. Like many researchers of dynamic images, the authors refer to G. Deleuze’s concept of image-motion. However, they rethink his ideas in relation to the nature of computer games, the visual expression plane of which is not so much a spectacle for aesthetic experience, but rather an environment where the observed is a stimulus for the player’s physical response. The stimulating role of images is considered in the article on the example of “serious” games designed to help people socially and psychologically. Four game cases (Gris, 2018; Auti-Sim, 2013; SnowWorld, 2003; Dreams, 2020) are analyzed, each embodying a dominant image variant—action, perception, emotion, or development—spurring players to different reactions. The classification discussed and the analysis performed contribute to a better understanding of the nature of computer games.","[{""name"": ""Olga V.

This article departs from persisting auteurist approaches to consider the post-New Wave oeuvres and careers of these directors collectively, in terms which foreground the importance of collaborations and networks rather than individual authorship and seek to decentre, denaturalise and potentially dislodge their pre-eminent association with specifically Northern, British, social realism and its presumed legacies. I argue for the importance of a cluster of less-analysed areas of intersection and development which emerge across the eclectic film-making careers of Tony Richardson and John Schlesinger (and, to a lesser extent, Karel Reisz) in the immediate post-New Wave decade from the 1963 success of Richardson's Tom Jones to the early 1970s. My discussion pivots on two commonalities: during this time, all three directors contributed significantly and plurally to innovations and advances in genre and representation across two areas distinct from British Northern working-class realism: historical/costume film genres, and queer representation. An approach which centres the (broadly defined) queer elements in these directors’ post-New Wave oeuvres – intersecting at times with their equally undervalued contribution to ‘pre-heritage’ period cinema – reveals the ‘Long’ New Wave as substantially a cinema of adaptation, collaboration and queerness which encompassed important, near-forgotten, international projects as well as modernist influences and, in Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday, a significant advance in realist queer representation.","[{""name"": ""Claire Monk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctvn96fj7"", ""10.1093/screen/19.3.9"", ""10.1002/9781118482889.ch8"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-53943-4"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719083389.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9798765105559"", ""10.1515/9781474452052-008"", ""10.1093/screen/15.2.7"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2021.0555"", ""10.4324/9780203392652"", ""10.7765/9781526133137.00010"", ""10.1515/9781474427869"", ""10.1080/01439685.2014.879000"", ""10.1093/screen/26.1.50""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Gender Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Even major film festivals seemed “not friendly” to Nollywood films. Today, the quality of Nollywood films has remarkably improved even though much is still to be done. However, it remains important to examine if such improvement in quality has affected international film critics’ reception of Nollywood films.

I also demonstrate the series’ commitment to breaking the illusion of inhumanity that the royal family tries to maintain, by showing that the royals are not out-of-reach ideals, but humans who struggle to transcend their exceptionally binding facticity. As portrayed in The Crown, Queen Elizabeth's lucidity on her situation leads to honest introspection, which dispels any attempt at self-deception, and therefore prevents her from slipping into bad faith.","[{""name"": ""Gabrielle Pozzo di Borgo"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Scholar""]}]","[""10.1353/tsw.2010.a461387"", ""10.3167/9780857457295"", ""10.1093/mind/LXXIII.291.374"", ""10.1080/01916599.2021.1914934"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719099564.003.0016"", ""10.3366/film.2020.0135""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The paper shows that despite its ostensibly progressive stance of giving space to Afghan women’s voice, the film, serves to validate the new form the colonial self has taken in the globalized world - the humanitarian identity - and reaffirms the American imperial agenda.

10.1215/02705346-8359506,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Framing Black Performance: Selma and the Poetics of Representation,"Recent African American film scholarship has called for an attention to the structures of black representation on screen. This work echoes the calls made in the 1990s by black feminist film and cultural scholars to resist the allure of reading for racial realism and to develop more appropriate critical tools and terms to acknowledge black artistic innovations. This essay takes up and reiterates that call, drawing attention to the problems of film interpretation that attend to a version of historical analysis without an understanding of form and medium. Foregrounding film as a terrain of struggle, the essay mobilizes an analysis of the 2014 film Selma to illuminate the multiple resonances of the concept representation. Focusing on the film’s representation of women and girl characters, the essay argues that cinematic play with the terms and conditions of representation comment powerfully on the limitations of cinematic and historical discourses to speak about the black femme as a political subject. Analysis of Selma exposes the key problems of reception and criticism facing contemporary African American film.

10.2979/blc.00009,BLACK CAMERA,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Finally Got the News, on Another Continent","Abstract: For many of its initial viewers, Finally Got the News gave food for thought to those who had paid little or no attention to the tens of millions of unwaged and waged workers of non-European origins who have toiled for capitalism in the modern era worldwide. The distinctive feature of Finally Got the News is that it shows Black Detroit, in the aftermath of the 1967 Rebellion, taking freedom of speech seriously and speaking for itself without any deference to condescending powers. The film made a particular impact on young working class and student activists who gathered for two days of political debate on an isolated farm near Florence in August 1970, a meeting organized by the Italian extra-parliamentary group, Potere Operaio (PO). One of the leaders of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers, John Watson, introduced the film with his history of the self-activity of African American laborers in the United States. In the end, many found the translation of Watson's ideas on screen more compelling than Watson's own in-person presentation. The Florence screening of Finally Got the News ended with big applause. I recount the events herein and put the film in dialogue with revolutionary currents throughout postwar Europe.","[{""name"": ""Ferruccio Gambino"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

I focus on Black women playwrights’ portrayals of Black mothers’ anxieties about protecting their sons, and of Black mothers and sisters grieving the loss of sons, brothers, and fathers in incidents where excessive force is deployed by the police. I consider how Black Lives, Black Words connects to the radical aesthetics of the 1960 s Black Arts Movement by promoting the use of theatre for activist purposes. I argue that the politicising potential of the Black Lives, Black Words initiative is accentuated by the use of a short play format as a political Black aesthetics for responding to contemporary crises. By analysing pivotal moments in a sample of the fifteen-minute plays, I demonstrate how the content of the plays combines with their performance styles to maximise the potential for audience empathy despite their short playing times.","[{""name"": ""Lynette Goddard"", ""affiliation"": [""Royal Holloway, University of LondonUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

10.3138/md.64-4-1044,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Femi Osofisan's Evolving Global Consciousness in Four Adaptations,"Femi Osofisan is one of contemporary theatre’s greatest adapters. His dramaturgy frequently intertwines European texts with Yoruba songs, dances, rituals, and other cultural elements to break down ostensible cultural barriers. This article interprets Osofisan’s career as a movement from domestic to international concerns, charting the evolution of his dramaturgical approach from his early to later works to demonstrate his expanding cosmopolitan and postcolonial engagements. I argue that four of his adaptations – Who’s Afraid of Solarin? (1978), Tegonni (1994), Wesoo, Hamlet! (2003), and Women of Owu (2004) – serve as an index of Osofisan’s artistic focus as it shifts from a concentration on Nigeria’s domestic problems to expressing a Nigerian perspective on global issues. The latter three plays rely on complex and dynamic intertextuality, reflecting a postmodern self-consciousness as Osofisan metatheatrically explores the processes of performance, theatre, and art through direct interplay between his own characters and those of his Greek or Shakespearean sources. This argument challenges accounts of Osofisan’s career that emphasize an exclusive interest in Nigeria’s domestic politics, arguing instead that his drama is involved in a longstanding project of intercultural adaptation as a means of addressing international political, economic, and security problems.","[{""name"": ""Phillip Zapkin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/9789401209571"", ""10.1353/cdr.2017.0000""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, US) to show how white women's dancing bodies participate in the “talent relocations” that the movie both thematizes and suppresses. Specifically, it focuses on the relationship between Debbie Reynolds, who was a novice dancer when she was cast in the film, and the two other white women dancers who helped shape Reynolds's filmic body: assistant choreographer Carol Haney and dance-in Jeanne Coyne. Combining feminist and critical race perspectives with production studies, film studies, and dance and performance studies, the essay unites often disconnected gendered and racial analyses of the film by emphasizing the gendered forms of labor and the multiracial genealogies through which dance is reproduced. It also shows how the guise of white credibility enabled Reynolds to conceal her intercorporeal and multiracial debts. Finally, the essay argues that the presence of dancers of color in the film, most notably Rita Moreno, haunts the chains of white corporeal debt that bind Reynolds to Haney and Coyne.","[{""name"": ""Anthea Kraut"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Music']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

In spite of the binary struggle between the (presumed) chauvinist filmmakers and their feminist counterparts, masculinity always (re)emerges in new forms or topoi to dominate femininity. Consequently, there seems to be a paradigm shift on the (mis)representation of women that reinforces Laura Mulvey’s sexual voyeuristic objectification of the feminine gender as reflected in near-nude costumes as well as sexually larded scenes that are common sights in African films, particularly those from Ghana. Employing the historical-analytic and observation methods, this article examines three selected films: The Maid I Hired (2010), Why Did I Get Married? (2007) and To Love a Prince (2014) by Frank Rajah Arase (FRA), an African filmmaker of Benin (Edo) extraction who largely operates in the Diaspora, to foreground and highlight the voyeuristic imprints in Ghanaian films (Ghallywood), which tend to demean the feminine gender in the context of African culture that hegemonizes the male folk.","[{""name"": ""Osakue S.

I then turn to recent ecofeminist theories in order to discuss Dosch's performative criticism of industrial exploitation of non-androcentric ‘others’, as well as the implications behind her dramatization of interspecies sexual intercourse. Finally, I examine how her ‘ventriloquist’ techniques to provide the horse with a voice invite considerations regarding Levinas's concept of ‘the face’ and how that affects animal subjecthood and subjectivity.","[{""name"": ""IGNACIO RAMOS-GAY"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1079/9781786391650.0169"", ""10.1002/9780470776148"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226686400.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

This study seeks to verify that the correlation between Pygmalion and Faust is not simply compositional and confirm that Shaw not only was influenced by various favorite operas (which use Part 1 of Faust as a major plot) but also had Faust in mind (including Part 2) in the overall structure, as evidenced in this study through an analysis of specific scenes.","[{""name"": ""Hyun-Kyu Jung"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"
10.3366/jbctv.2023.0680,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,Feelings and Facts: Agency in Northern Irish Cinema,"Northern Irish cinema has long had an ambivalent relationship to the representation of history, sometimes implicitly rejecting ‘rational’ or ‘objective’ approaches in favour of emphasising the untidy and subjective emotions of its historical narratives. More recently, the films made in and about Northern Ireland have reflected a loss of agency, in particular, the sense of efficacy, locus of control and prospection which creates a belief in our ability to change our environment. Meanwhile, neoliberalism, placing the responsibility for recovery on the individual while removing systems of economic, social and cultural support, creates the conditions under which this loss of agency becomes crisis. The promotion of individual interest obstructs collective political action and progressive change. This article considers the representation of agency in two recent films about the Troubles, Belfast (2022) and I Am Belfast (2015), suggesting that film can – but does not necessarily – offer a space for emotional reflection and restoration of agency.","[{""name"": ""Jennie Carlsten"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/bjso.12438"", ""10.1177/13591045221075525"", ""10.5040/9781350105676"", ""10.1177/0309816818818309"", ""10.53386/nilq.v71i4.896"", ""10.5040/9781838711238"", ""10.59522/ZBLI5033"", ""10.1353/frm.2014.a556145"", ""10.1080/17526272.2021.1873534"", ""10.1080/17439760.2020.1832250"", ""10.1177/1745691612474317""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The study focuses on a number of programmes where one of the most popular Swedish artists of the period, the jazz singer Monica Zetterlund, appears in performance.

I also wrote uncredited revisions of DreamWorks’s Small Soldiers and Castle Rock’s Alaska, both involving prominent child characters. I have to confess that my reputation for writing content for children and adolescents realistically did not stem from any natural ability.

This article presents the case for Faroese cinema as a nation-building practice within a transnational funding, production and distribution context. By expanding the notion of Faroese cinema to include films containing various national and transnational markers, it aims to provide a deeper and broader understanding of the development of a distinct film industry on the Faroe Islands. Extending from previous work in transnationalism and globalization in Nordic cinema, this article argues that Faroese cinema is inherently transnational and that recent institutional establishments and feature film productions are not starting points for Faroese cinema, but rather milestones in its development.","[{""name"": ""Bradley Harmon"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122986657 University of Washington""]}]","[""10.1177/0010836713514150"", ""10.1386/jsca_00019_1""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Noting that the backlash to diversification has coalesced in the form of opposition to a hollowed-out conception of Critical Race Theory, Qureshi suggests an ancillary development within mainstream journalism that he calls Critical Representation Theory: the uplift of the minority critic as a representational course correction. He argues that Critical Representation Theory means that critics of color are pigeonholed by identity in terms of the films they are assigned and likewise restricts their responses through the narrow lens of race. Using the examples of Eternals (Chloé Zhao, 2021) and Dune (Denis Villeneuve, 2021)—two recent blockbusters notable for their diverse casting, or lack thereof—Qureshi argues for a critical practice removed from political and representational imperatives.","[{""name"": ""Bilal Qureshi"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Depending on the degree of government involvement in film industry market regulation, the national models in this area may vary. When it comes to European feature films, the producers ride on five main sources: direct government funding, broadcasting investment, producer investment, pre-sales, and tax incentives. The most important here are the first two, which focus 26% and 21% of support, respectively. Most European countries today provide their film industries by investing in the production process directly—through the pre-acquisition and/or co-production of films and television programs, and indirectly, by contributing to their national film funds. Such forms of investment are constantly evolving, since they have already proven themselves to be very effective. Other market players—exhibitors, distributors of audiovisual content and creators of film content on physical media—support national and European film production through compulsory contributions to cinema funds. The emergence and popularity of video-on-demand platforms has boosted broadcasters’ financial commitments. The article also provides information on the technical details of this multi-step process: the author classifies the existing types of broadcasters’ obligations, and analyzes the mechanisms of financial support for film production by television channels.","[{""name"": ""GALIYA M.

This approach is typically referred to as mixed-methods or multi-method research.

This chapter presents an overview of interpreting research methodologies and explores the meaning of mixed methods. It then discusses a mixed-methods, longitudinal multi-stage project comprising a series of studies conducted by the authors that investigated the feasibility of deaf signers serving as jurors using professional sign language interpreting services. By showcasing our own studies and why these interlinked projects employed mixed methods, we highlight the benefits of exploring various approaches to interpreting research generally.","[{""name"": ""Jemina Napier"", ""affiliation"": [""Heriot-Watt University""]}, {""name"": ""Sandra Hale"", ""affiliation"": [""University of New South Wales""]}]","[""10.4324/9781315707280"", ""10.1177/002383097301600307"", ""10.1075/intp.15.2.03bra"", ""10.4135/9781412984294"", ""10.12807/ti.109201.2017.a01"", ""10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113618"", ""10.4135/9781849209441"", ""10.1177/1558689812437183"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2006.00194.x"", ""10.1075/aral.19.1.04hal"", ""10.1080/13556509.1997.10798987"", ""10.1558/sll.1999.6.1.57"", ""10.1075/btl.52"", ""10.1057/9780230593442"", ""10.1080/1750399X.2018.1541649"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226647821.003.0010"", ""10.1075/tis.19081.hal"", ""10.1075/intp.00077.hal"", ""10.1075/intp.19.1.04hal"", ""10.1075/target.28.3.01hal"", ""10.1558/ijsll.32896"", ""10.1075/intp.00008.han"", ""10.1111/puar.12981"", ""10.1177/1558689806298224"", ""10.1075/btl.99.08liu"", ""10.1080/14781700.2017.1374206"", ""10.1177/1077800410364612"", ""10.1177/0002764211433797"", ""10.1515/ijtr-2017-0001"", ""10.1515/9783110802474.3"", ""10.4324/9780203117743"", ""10.1515/9781614511472.85"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-67140-2"", ""10.12807/ti.110202.2018.a08"", ""10.1177/1037969X1504000106"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2rh2bwn.15"", ""10.12807/ti.109202.2017.a01"", ""10.1558/ijsll.30878"", ""10.1075/btl.87.09nap"", ""10.1353/sls.2018.0034"", ""10.1075/btl.109.23nie"", ""10.4324/9780203504802"", ""10.1075/btl.99.04poch"", ""10.1075/intp.1.1.04roy"", ""10.1057/9781137035035_1"", ""10.1080/1323238X.2017.1392479"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1234633"", ""10.12807/ti.109201.2017.a07"", ""10.1080/1750399X.2014.971486""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.3366/jbctv.2020.0530,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,Exploiting Ambiguity: Murder! and the Meanings of Cross-Dressing in Interwar British Cinema,"The crime film Murder! (1930), directed by Alfred Hitchcock for British International Pictures and based on the novel Enter Sir John (1929) by Clemence Dane and Helen Simpson, has long been cited in debates about the treatment of queer sexuality in Hitchcock's films. Central to these debates is the character of Handel Fane and the depiction of his cross-dressed appearances as a theatre and circus performer, which many critics have understood as a coded reference to homosexuality. This article explores such critical interpretations by situating Murder! more firmly in its historical context. In particular, it examines Fane's cross-dressed performances in relation to other cultural representations of men's cross-dressing in interwar Britain. These include examples from other British and American films, stories in the popular press and the publicity surrounding the aerial performer and female impersonator Barbette (Vander Clyde). The article argues that Murder! reflects and exploits a broader fascination with gender ambiguity in British popular culture, and that it anticipates the more insistent vilification of queer men in the decades after the Second World War.","[{""name"": ""Chris O'Rourke"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5040/9781474291354"", ""10.1002/9781444397321.ch25"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1220htt.14"", ""10.1111/1468-0424.00251"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226788272.001.0001"", ""10.5810/kentucky/9780813160825.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13688804.2014.898895"", ""10.1525/9780520932432"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226500690.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-0424.12467"", ""10.1057/9780230501805_12"", ""10.4324/9780203391303""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

The actors’ interpretive roles in the films, their memories and experiences, and the contradictions of their participation in colonial films and beyond, form part of an unexplored and hidden archive in South African film scholarship. This article focuses on Ken Gampu’s early life in the cinema by reflecting on his participation in two films: a western The Hellions and the drama Dingaka. Gampu was a well-known South African actor and also the first Black actor from that country to succeed in Hollywood. This article proposes an experimental methodology of life-writing called ‘cinematic biography’. It shows that the cinematic lives of the marginalized and colonized actors harbour critical potential in enriching the critical perspectives on the cinema and cinematic cultures in South Africa and beyond.","[{""name"": ""Litheko Modisane"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419371151 University of Cape Town""]}]","[""10.2307/441574"", ""10.1080/19392390903519065""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

A Dog Called Money (2019) is a film with essayistic and documentary features by photographer Seamus Murphy about the creation process of British musician PJ Harvey's latest album, The Hope Six Demolition Project. The film focuses on the artists' journey in Afghanistan, Kosovo, and Washington DC and the album's production process, which takes place in a live museum exhibition. Murphy uses visual narrative, while Harvey takes on the role of the textual and auditory narrator with voice-over, text, and music. Therefore, this study analyses the textual and audio-visual features of the documentary film that reflect the self-representation of both artists. The representation form created by the layered narrators that the film's narrative varies between the essay and the documentary genre is interpreted in the context of image, sound, and text.","[{""name"": ""Özgür Çalışkan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Communication', 'History', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"
10.1386/smt_00041_1,STUDIES IN MUSICAL THEATRE,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Examining the 'histo-remix': Public memory, Burkean identification and feminism in the musical Six","The musical Six has taken the United Kingdom by storm, earning five Olivier nominations in 2019 and crossing the pond, previewing on Broadway in the spring of 2020. Six tells the story of Henry VIII’s six wives in what the musical portrays as their own words, with a twist – the six wives form a girl group performing a concert for their audience. Through a rhetorical analysis of the musical’s script, cast recording, piano/vocal score, and field notes from two performances, I argue that Six creates public memory of Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anna of Cleves, Katherine Howard and Catherine Parr, focusing on their individual personalities and accomplishments, rather than simply on their relationship to Henry VIII, as documented history describes them. I suggest that by doing so, Six minimizes the role of place and time in the creation of public memory. Furthermore, I argue that this creation of public memory is intertwined with Burkean identification, as theatregoers find themselves connecting with one or more of the queens as they are portrayed in Six. By combining twenty-first-century language with the stories of sixteenth-century women, Six builds consubstantiality between its characters and its audiences. This article also explores how the final number, Six, reinvents the women’s stories as they might have been if they had lived in the twenty-first century and the impact that this has on public memory. Finally, I suggest that Six is a feminist text, advocating for solidarity and the individually defined empowerment of all women.","[{""name"": ""Valerie Lynn Schrader"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000120974281 Pennsylvania State University – Schuylkill""]}]","[""10.1080/10510970802623633"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.1997.tb00002.x"", ""10.1386/smt_00028_1"", ""10.1515/9780691186658-007"", ""10.1080/07350198.2011.581942"", ""10.1177/107769900508200403"", ""10.1386/smt.12.3.291_1"", ""10.1386/smt.12.3.377_1"", ""10.1080/10570319309374468"", ""10.1080/00335638309383643"", ""10.1080/10570310600843504"", ""10.1386/smt.10.1.93_1"", ""10.1080/10570319209374422"", ""10.1080/10417949509372968"", ""10.1386/smt.9.2.187_1"", ""10.1080/01463370109385634"", ""10.1177/1367549416682238"", ""10.1386/smt_00017_1"", ""10.1080/10417940600846029"", ""10.1080/03637758909390253"", ""10.2307/2928520"", ""10.1386/smt.12.1.43_1"", ""10.1080/00335630009384308"", ""10.1080/10570311003680600"", ""10.1080/09647775.2012.720188"", ""10.1017/S0266464X19000265"", ""10.1386/smt.11.1.51_1"", ""10.1080/10417940902741514"", ""10.1080/01463379409369921"", ""10.1086/603598"", ""10.2307/1908632"", ""10.14321/rhetpublaffa.18.1.0117"", ""10.3138/md.47.2.309"", ""10.1386/smt.3.2.201/1"", ""10.1080/02773940309391252"", ""10.1386/smt_00041_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

In foregrounding the refusal of configurations substantiated by state concessions and normalisation treaties, the article treats loss as central to the manifold rehearsals of return. In AlSalah’s work, loss is understood not as becoming less, but rather as a proposition for becoming otherwise. Here, the practice of loss is explored through the glitch as both a conceptual framework espousing opacity and a pragmatic tool engaging pixel breaks. Rather than reducing the glitch to a mere erroneous aesthetic, the article underscores the active capacity in encountering a glitch or deliberately engendering it by exploring the tensions between colonial imageries reproduced in digital maps, and, in contrast, montage as AlSalah’s tool for intervention. Finally, the article serves as a theoretical experimentation with what I call “dialectical poethics,” which reads the filmic return through loss as an attempt to go against linearity, intelligibility, and finality, yet insists on a materialist grounding of the glitch as a method that is historically situated rather than always-already emancipatory.","[{""name"": ""Samira Makki"", ""affiliation"": [""Norwegian University of Science and Technology""]}]","[""10.1080/00064246.2014.11413690"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9906.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226245904.001.0001"", ""10.1177/02633957221122366"", ""10.2307/464747"", ""10.1215/9780822376491"", ""10.2307/j.ctvsf1q4v.13""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Since its revival in the 1970s, the work has been performed around the world in multiple languages and has been transformed into a best-selling book by Tony Kushner and Maurice Sendak. Used as a tool for Holocaust education, many modern productions emphasize a narrative of cultural resistance as a way of reading the work, transforming Brundibár’s Brechtian agitprop plot of collective action profoundly. In the Sydney production of 2014, a decision was made to stay faithful to the original motives of the composer and librettist, and the production was shaped by ethnographic testimony of those who had witnessed the original performances.

Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, US, 2011) and memoirs and coming- out guides written by Chaz, and with a particular focus on an exchange concerning an answering machine that lodges Chaz’s changing voice, this article examines how sonic archives are, for Cher and Chaz as for earlier listeners, contested sites of mourning and becoming. Through a reading of Chaz’s voice on Cher’s answering machine, one that considers the projects of phonography and telephony on which it is based, and which draws as well on the concurrent archival concerns of the television show Transparent (Amazon, 2014–19), the article demonstrates how the epistemic and affective stakes of transgender bodies are mediated through specific sonic technologies that give rise to forms of mournful archives. It seeks to show how the answering machine subtends histories that conflate literal death and gender transition; for Chaz, it also affords more radical possibilities than verbal practice alone. Attending to the answering machine complicates the association between voice and agency on which a slogan like “Silence = Death” relies and yields a rethinking of media history and sound studies as they relate to queer lives.","[{""name"": ""Lilia Kilburn"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Music'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Even in the United States, as armed white-supremacist, pro-Trump forces face off against protesters seeking justice for African Americans, the hostility is increasingly palpable, and often frightening. Yet as millions of Black Lives Matter protesters demonstrated after the brutal police killing of George Floyd, the current, intersecting crises – worsened by Trump’s criminalization of anti-racism protesters and his dismissal of science – demand a serious, engaged, response from activists as well as artists. The title of this article is meant to evoke not only the state of the unusually cruel moment through which we are living, but also the very different approaches to performance of both Brecht and Artaud, whose ideas, along with those of others – including Benjamin, Butler, Latour, Mbembe, and Césaire – inform the radical, open-ended, post-pandemic theatre practice proposed in this essay. A critically acclaimed dramatist as well as Professor of English and Playwriting at California State University, Northridge, Mitchell’s published volumes of plays include Disaster Capitalism; or Money Can’t Buy You Love: Three Plays; Brecht in L.A.; and Ventriloquist: Two Plays and Ventriloquial Miscellany.

Understanding the implications of this line requires appreciating the extent it activates the early modern discourse of envy. Because Shakespeare makes his Cassius dispositionally envious — an invention not found in Plutarch — comprehending the full import of the enviousness his ‘lean and hungry look’ entails is vital to grasping the playwright’s characterization. Unpacking the association between leanness and envy in Renaissance literary culture reveals how Shakespeare’s handling of his source had immediate thematic resonance for his audience.,"[{""name"": ""Bradley Irish"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['History', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

The British theatre group Forced Entertainment provides a contemporary example of a (post-)avant-garde vocabulary that actively borrows from and transforms the practices of their precursors. They employ a palimpsest-like layering of visual and verbal elements, which I will here define as performative meta-collages. In this article, I will discuss their practice and take a look at the ways in which Forced Entertainment’s performative meta-collages verbalize and produce “future” in one of their recent performances, End Meeting for All, which imagines a scenario that takes place “a year and a day” after the beginning of the COVID-19-triggered lockdown in the spring of 2020.","[{""name"": ""Luciana Tamas"", ""affiliation"": [""Technische Universität Braunschweig Germany""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-476-03610-0"", ""10.5040/9781408167762"", ""10.3817/0984061186"", ""10.2307/1124757"", ""10.2307/1125090""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Conservation', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Eurimages, the Council of Europe’s film fund, inaugurated the first policies promoting European financial co-productions more than two decades ago by introducing the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production. Many European film funds have followed the same policies on the national level, but the Danish Film Institute has been by far the most innovative. This article explores in more detail the DFI’s internationalization policy actions, particularly its minority co-production scheme, which democratized the practice of European co-production that traditionally had been the sole purview of a narrow circle of high-profile European producers. The shift enabled young Danish producers to engage in minority co-productions, popularizing co-production as a model among Danish producers of all calibres and triggering a dynamic knowledge transfer between co-producers.","[{""name"": ""Petar Mitric"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000041937116X Charles University, Prague""]}]","[""10.1080/0143968032000095569"", ""10.1177/0002764211398078"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-97157-5_4"", ""10.1080/13662710701524072"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-97157-5_9"", ""10.1386/jsca_00020_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Urban Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

In this study, we investigated the role of these factors by presenting Spanish and Finnish participants films produced in Finland, Spain, or the United States. Emotional reactions were assessed online through a response system synchronized with the films and offline through questionnaires. Results indicated that overall emotional reactions of the two audiences were very similar, suggesting a high degree of universality. However, we also found differences in the way the two audiences reacted to some specific sequences within the films. Qualitative analyses suggested that these differences are related to some cultural dimensions (e.g., collectivism). We interpret the data as supporting both universality and cultural mediation where cultural variation might be more evident in films varying in narrative structure, genre, or cultural origin.","[{""name"": ""Jose Cañas-Bajo"", ""affiliation"": [""Project Researcher, Aalto University, Finland jose.canasbajo@aalto.fi""]}, {""name"": ""Johanna Silvennoinen"", ""affiliation"": [""Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Jyväskylä, Finland johanna.silvennoinen@jyu.fi""]}, {""name"": ""Pertti Saariluoma"", ""affiliation"": [""Professor, University of Jyväskylä, Finland pertti.saariluoma@jyu.fi""]}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Gender Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It captures a moment of my attempt to share a hug with my audience—to connect with them in an intimate way amid the borders of physical distance imposed on us and by us. Looking at this visual representation of my performance, however, I feel my distance from the experience of my dancing body and all that it tries to teach me. I desire an embodied connection with the gestures of that performance to guide me forward into our uncertain future.

10.3138/ctr.191.001,CANADIAN THEATRE REVIEW,1303 Drama Film and Television,Editorial: The Politics of Performing House: Transnational Perspectives,"Asking, What is the relationship between housing and performance?, editors Laura Levin and Sunita Nigam insist that the lines between the two begin to blur when we attend to the aesthetic and embodied dimensions of housing, on the one hand, and the homely, spatial, and thematic concerns of certain performances, on the other. Considering contexts of housing crises, shortages, and discrimination, the editors argue that houses of all kinds must be treated as processual, performative practices and as intended and unintended displays that reveal much about the material contexts in which they are embedded. As important zones for the realization, rehearsal, thwarting, or abandonment of private and collective fantasies, all houses are ‘dream houses,’ whether these dreams be good or bad. Levin and Nigam make a case for paying attention to aesthetic references, movement vocabularies, narratives about housing, scripts for housing practices, and the gendering and racializing of certain roles—all aspects of ‘practising house’—that make spaces (real and imagined) meaningful for those who perform them and spectate them. They argue for the importance of reading housing practices both in relation to local conditions and through transnational and hemispheric frameworks, asserting that the performative politics of housing brings into view shared experiences of dwelling, citizenship, and belonging that cross—and, more crucially, contest—geopolitical borders. In doing so, they emphasize how housing practices are haunted by the rupture that colonization created with existing Indigenous modes of dwelling, especially as a consequence of establishing settler-colonial territory and domestic spaces.","[{""name"": ""Laura Levin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sunita Nigam"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9781315225906"", ""10.1017/CCOL9780521874014.006"", ""10.5040/9781474285186"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5842.2006.00797.x"", ""10.1177/1474474014561575"", ""10.1080/10464883.1987.10758422"", ""10.1353/book13205"", ""10.1057/9781137027290"", ""10.1057/9780230597723"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-30521-2"", ""10.4324/9780203852897"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816672875.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01581-7"", ""10.1057/9781137274250"", ""10.1017/S030788330500115X"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-28558-4"", ""10.5040/9781350006102"", ""10.1057/9780230286245"", ""10.1057/9781137317148""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

In this context, the performance also prompts considerations of the relationships between the enduring histories of racial capitalism and the futures of choreographic economies.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Chaleff"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"
10.1017/S0266464X20000779,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,Ecological Adaptation in Montana: Timon of Athens to Timon of Anaconda,"In this article Gretchen E. Minton describes her adaptation of William Shakespeare and Thomas Middleton’s 1606 play Timon of Athens. This adaptation, called Timon of Anaconda, focuses on the environmental legacy of Butte, Montana, a mining city that grew quickly, flourished, fell into recession, and then found itself labelled the largest Superfund clean-up site in the United States. Timon of Anaconda envisions Timon as a wealthy mining mogul whose loss of fortunes and friends echoes the boom-and-bust economy of Butte. The original play’s language about the poisoning of nature and the troubled relationship between the human and more-than-human worlds is amplified and adjusted in Timon of Anaconda in order to reflect upon ongoing environmental concerns in Montana. Minton explains the ecodramaturgical aims, site-specific locations, and directorial decisions of this adaptation’s performances, which took place in September 2019. Gretchen E. Minton is Professor of English at Montana State University, Bozeman. She has edited several early modern plays, including Timon of Athens, Troilus and Cressida, Twelfth Night, and The Revenger’s Tragedy. She is the dramaturg for Montana Shakespeare in the Parks and Bozeman Actors Theatre, and her directorial projects include A Doll’s House (2019), Timon of Anaconda (2019–20), and Shakespeare’s Walking Story (2020).","[{""name"": ""Gretchen E.

In response to the changing media environment, Russian TV companies are compelled to explore new markets worldwide to provide information about the Russian Federation. The authors identify China as a key alternative to the lost markets, given the booming Chinese media industry that offers a variety of news consumption options to the audience. Among these options, short online videos have gained significant popularity, with Douyin emerging as one of the most successful short-video platforms. This article analyzes the evolution of this phenomenon in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and aims to observe the reasons behind the format’s popularity among the Chinese audience. The relevance of this paper lies in the necessity to study effective and legitimate methods of news production on Chinese internet platforms for Russian TV companies. Analyzing a total of 5765 posts, the authors focus on the topics, length, and content creation methods used by three television companies (CCTV, Henan TV, Shanghai Dragon TV) when posting news on the social media platform Douyin. Additionally, a review of the regulations governing the work of Chinese and foreign media in China has been carried out. The study describes the distinctive features and development strategies of the accounts of these TV channels and concludes with recommendations that Russian media can utilize in adapting news content for well-known Chinese online platforms.","[{""name"": ""EVGENIYA L.

An exception to the seeming incommensurability of commercial feature filmmaking and the anti-capitalist and anti-racist traditions of Asian American cinema, the film highlights how the conventions of transpacific genre films condition the intimate public of Asian American audiences. To be legible as an Asian American, the film shows, is to be attuned to the conventions of its dominant, often hegemonic and repressive, representations. By illustrating how genre conventions condition the sense of belonging amongst its Asian American protagonists, the film offers new ways of imagining and relating with Asian America Cinema.","[{""name"": ""Jason Coe"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The study utilized the ensemble machine learning model HistGradientBoostingClassifier and a sequential fully connected three-layer neural network based on the TensorFlow library, along with basic methods of natural language processing. It was found that patriotic films exhibit distribution characteristics lower than the market average and significantly lag behind successful Russian cinema projects at the box office. The study demonstrated the possibility of accurately predicting film box office receipts, distribution characteristics, as well as selecting project parameters and the composition of its creative team to enhance distribution results and increase the reach of target audiences. The study also illustrated the use of language models, specifically through film annotations, to create effective film content. A conclusion was drawn regarding the need for a set of measures to implement state policy in the field of education, information technology, culture, and art, focusing on the creation of unified media franchises and umbrella brands encompassing films, TV series, computer and online games, music, and other products. The implementation of the research results will enhance the effectiveness of public policy and the return on public and private- public investments in the creative industries sector, positioning cinema and the creative industry as self-sustaining and income-generating sectors of the economy. Leveraging rental data from other markets will facilitate the creation of content with higher demand globally, serving as a soft power and cultural influence tool. The results of the study can aid in project selection and film project development by the Russian Cinema Fund, the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation, private Russian investors and film studios, as well as authorities and organizations responsible for distributing Russian film content abroad.","[{""name"": ""ANTON V.

10.3366/jbctv.2021.0555,JOURNAL OF BRITISH CINEMA AND TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,EMI and the 'Pre-heritage' Period Film,"First coined in the UK in the early 1990s as a new label for an ostensibly new, post-1979 kind and cycle of period cinema, the ‘heritage film’ is now firmly established as a widely used term and category in academic film studies. Although the heritage film’s defining features, ideological character and ontological coherence would remain debated, its status as a ‘new’ category hinges, self-evidently, on the presumption that the films of post-1979 culturally English heritage cinema marked a new departure and were clearly distinct from their pre-Thatcher-era precursors. Yet, paradoxically, the British period/costume films of the preceding decade, the 1970s, have attracted almost no scholarly attention, and none which connects them with the post-1979 British heritage film, nor the 1980s cultural and industry conditions said to have fostered these productions with those of the 1970s. This article pursues these questions through the prism of Britain’s largest film production and distribution entity throughout 1970–86, EMI, and EMI’s place as a significant and sustained, but little-acknowledged, force in British period film production throughout that time. In so doing, the article establishes the case for studying ‘pre-heritage’ period cinema. EMI’s period film output included early proto-heritage films but also ventured notably wider. This field of production is examined within the broader terrain of 1970s British and American period cinema and within wider 1970s UK cinema box-office patterns and cultural trends, attending to commercial logics as well as to genre and the films' positioning in relation to the later heritage film debates.","[{""name"": ""Claire Monk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5040/9780755698820"", ""10.5040/9780755697403.ch-006"", ""10.5040/9781474290661.ch-015"", ""10.2307/25006751"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-92282-6_9"", ""10.1515/9780748647040"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94803-4"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521834759.017"", ""10.5040/9781838710835"", ""10.5040/9781838711528"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-92282-6_7"", ""10.3167/9781845455590"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-92282-6_10"", ""10.7765/9781526110855""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Urban Studies', 'History', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Living in the same capital, they shared aesthetic, theatrical, editorial and political allegiances, and were both at some points intrigued by each other’s work and life. Both produced a medially diverse oeuvre including novels, theatre plays, screenplays, both worked as directors, rather often with the same actors or troupes, and they were regularly considered as examples of the same aesthetic tendencies in literature and the theatre. Their writing – themes and styles – tends to diverge importantly on several points, but Beckett was impressed by Duras' first theatre play, and Duras occasionally identified strikingly with Beckett. Nonetheless, hardly any form of contact or of direct influence between the authors is known.","[{""name"": ""Matthijs Engelberts"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/mod.2011.0108""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

The corpus is constituted by the biggest box office hits each year between 2010 and 2017, which are analysed thematically. This study suggests that the characteristics of the narcocultura continue circulating within Mexican cinema, but it does not point to a subgenre’s existence. The genres circumscribing the films analysed promote the narcos’ heroism via archetypes and iconography, which symbolize how narcos overcome their modus vivendi to stand as a legitimate authority against a corrupt government. Alongside this representation of narcos, these films also present objectified women and promote values such as loyalty and family. The aforementioned archetypes and iconography offer a view of life in which violence is normalized, and crime is seen as a legitimate lifestyle.","[{""name"": ""Elba Díaz-Cerveró"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad Panamericana""]}, {""name"": ""Gabriel Domínguez-Partida"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad Panamericana""]}]","[""10.22395/angr.v12n23a1"", ""10.14483/21450706.13534"", ""10.5565/rev/mitologias.401"", ""10.1386/slac_00047_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Computer Science']","['Cultural Studies', 'Computer Networks and Communications', 'Linguistics and Language']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)]]"
10.1386/jsca_00051_1,JOURNAL OF SCANDINAVIAN CINEMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Dream weaving and sonic metalepsis in Jan Troell's Land of Dreams,"Jan Troell’s Sagolandet (Land of Dreams) (1988) presents itself as a documentary about 1980s Swedish society, but is also a film about filmmaking, the imagination, memory and autobiography. The film has multiple narrative levels: interviews, home movie footage, autobiographical anecdotes and imaginative sequences. Commentary and guiding themes are drawn from the theories of psychoanalyst Rollo May. These strata and themes have associated musical motifs and/or sound effects, which, as the film progresses, serve as an ontological bridge between the different strata. Land of Dreams is structured as both a multistrand and multiform narrative with the intercutting of multiple stories with multiple protagonists (multistrand) mixed with dream worlds and internal-subjective perspectives of Troell (multiform). The different narrative strata invite metalepsis, a type of narrative ‘transgression’ that occurs across the boundaries of distinct narrative worlds. In Land of Dreams, voice, music and sound effects act as metaleptic agents, transgressing different strata through four interrelated techniques: (1) metaleptic ‘i-voices’; (2) musical structures made up of ironic and disjunctive musical textures; (3) musical motifs transgressing narrative and ontological boundaries and (4) musical metaleptic warps. Musical metalepsis in Land of Dreams functions in a way that is emblematic of how political decisions and public policy infiltrate the private sphere, human consciousness and even dreams of the future.","[{""name"": ""Alexis Luko"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369465 University of Victoria""]}]","[""10.1080/17400300902816812"", ""10.1093/screen/40.2.146"", ""10.1525/ncm.2011.34.3.302"", ""10.1093/ml/gcq019"", ""10.1386/jsca_00051_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

How did Kubrick transform one of his time’s most pressing causes of psychological distress into a source of humorous pleasure? To answer this question, I offer a cognitive account of how comic distance works on film, building on research indicating humor to be an evolved response to benign violations. I show that Kubrick consistently optimized for psychological distance in Dr. Strangelove, comparing his narrative and stylistic choices to those of Sidney Lumet in Fail Safe, a contemporaneous film that plays the same essential story for drama instead of laughs.","[{""name"": ""Marc Hye-Knudsen"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate, Aarhus University marchyeknudsen@gmail.com""]}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Social Psychology', 'Health Information Management']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7414), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7405)]]"

Instead of addressing this question through examination of the politics of the series’ representations or through examination of the genre of the period drama, I use McGowan’s film theory to consider how the series constructs its viewer through ideological operations. Downton Abbey, this article demonstrates, answers the viewer’s desire with fantasy and thus assures viewers of the omnipotence and rightness of the ideological structures under which we live. A comparative examination of Upstairs, Downstairs () reveals that the earlier series – despite thematic and generic similarities – resists solving the viewer’s desire and thus has the radical potential to construct a viewer who is more likely to question ideology. A final comparison of the last minutes of each series demonstrates Downton Abbey’s investment in the fantasy of tradition as well as a current cultural reluctance to productively confront significant social change.","[{""name"": ""Lori Robison"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368163 University of North Dakota""]}]","[""10.1080/13642529.2013.811811"", ""10.1080/01439689000260191"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-19798-9_3"", ""10.1215/02705346-11-1_31-26"", ""10.1386/jptv_00019_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Insofar as planetary impacts arise from “what we spend our time doing” – foraging, farming, feudal then waged labour, finally unsustainable consumption – such “doing” is understood as precisely ‘performative’ in the sense that its effects only arise from a massive social repetition that is confused with essential nature and thus concealed. Through a graphic model of such ‘plural performativity,’ four consecutive Anthropo(s)cenes are sketched: the Giving World of agriculture and state formation; the New World of colonial pillage and world trade; the Netherworld of wage labour and fossil capital; then ‘All the World’ but not with all of “us” as players. Apart from environmental changes, the paper targets performances of power and inequality: normative histories of ‘common sense’ on the one hand, concealing ‘people’s histories’ of conflict and opposition, on the other – the Anthropocene arising not simply from what the majority of people have been doing, but from what they have always beenforced to do.","[{""name"": ""Teemu Paavolainen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

As the first documentary director to concentrate his career on the White Terror period and transitional justice, Hung’s documentaries provide a case study to explore: (1) the impact of White Terror trauma on Hung’s filmmaking and screenwriting, particularly his narrative; (2) the transmission of personal traumatic experiences across generations and (3) the potential educational functions of these documentaries. Engaging with the concept of ‘postmemory’, this article investigates how trauma documentaries may facilitate intergenerational communication. Through a detailed textual analysis of Blind Night 暗夜哭聲 (2006), and ‘J. C.

Commentators repeatedly highlighted that the show’s emphasis on kindness, compassion and empathy was a key aspect of its success. This article will investigate how this emphasis played out when tackling complex issues such as racism, xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment in the context of English football and its fandom. I argue that the show used special episodes and emphasized individual action with regard to systemic issues, employing post-racial narrative logics, appeals to multiculturalism, tokenism and strategic Whiteness, to deflect from organizational and societal accountability for entrenched discrimination. The same pattern is also seen in the narrative arcs of Sam Obisanya and Nate Shelley. Though the two have contrasting depictions – the latter turning villainous for a time while the former remains virtuous – I maintain that both reflect a larger disinterest in the interiority of characters of colour relative to their White counterparts. I will also examine how the show sidesteps systemic racism in English football fandom to portray fans as largely positive. Finally, through an analysis of Edwin Akufo, I argue that the show’s commentary on issues in world football also reinforces racist stereotypes.","[{""name"": ""Rukmini Pande"", ""affiliation"": [""O.

While theatre scholars have regularly applied posthuman or cyborg theory to make sense of digital spectacle in performance, this article extends a posthuman approach to dramatic form by considering two plays from the early 2000s, a time of substantial technological change within affluent western societies. In both Lucy Prebble’s The Sugar Syndrome (2003) and Sarah Ruhl’s Dead Man’s Cell Phone (2007), the human characters share dramatic agency with the digital devices that surround them, co-initiating and co-escalating the drama. This distributed agency creates a shift in how the humans begin to perceive themselves and each other: from rational, coherent, autonomous selves – a liberal humanist subjectivity – to heterogeneous assemblages reminiscent of a digital computer – a posthuman subjectivity. While much posthuman theatre scholarship has focused on digital or bodily spectacle, dramaturgical analysis can also reveal the neglected technology of dramatic form to construct posthuman subjectivities for the stage.","[{""name"": ""Richard Jordan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/tj.2015.0132"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226093178.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781118104521"", ""10.1353/tj.1997.0103"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226321394.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10486801.2011.561488"", ""10.4135/9781848607958.n22"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004177628.i-259.81"", ""10.5040/9781350043190.ch-006"", ""10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Contexts for a Participatory Media Project,"AbstractThis paper presents a participatory film intervention focused on young people, which was held within the framework of a grant coordinated by the Minor Media/Culture Research Centre and took place in the form of a summer camp in 2021. After revisiting some historical examples and definitions of participatory film, the author focuses on the concept of displacement as used in film theory and psychology, which he attempts to redefine and thereby reverse its negative connotations. The author analyses the catalyst method, one of the various forms of implementing participatory video as a visual research method, which was the one used in the research described here. The participatory film methodology based on the camera-as-catalyst is meant to foster inter-group collaboration through camera use in order to achieve a free performance and interplay of identities and ultimately to strengthen social cohesion. Beyond the emancipatory intent, the diachronic and synchronic case studies are also linked by the fact that most of the projects were also collaborations with young people, as was the case in the Minor Media summer camp. In the final section, the author analyses the films made by the young people in terms of their relation to contemporary popular culture and the performance of adolescent identities defined by liminality.1","[{""name"": ""András Müllner"", ""affiliation"": [""Eötvös Loránd University ( Budapest , Hungary )""]}]","[""10.1515/9780773585263-038"", ""10.1037/e525952010-001"", ""10.1525/9780520928169"", ""10.1002/9781118767771.wbiedcs148"", ""10.1515/9780773585263-040"", ""10.5771/9780759121157-1"", ""10.20520/JEL-KEP.2020.2.129"", ""10.32564/124.3"", ""10.2307/j.ctv32bm1p2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-67608-7_10"", ""10.1111/1469-8676.12041"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-67608-7_7""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Plantinga argues for a link between disgust and ideology that helps to reveal deeper cultural significance in film, which Carroll’s work likewise supports. Plantinga further argues that disgust in art may be strangely attractive as well as repulsive, thereby eliciting reflection. I argue that combining these elements with philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah’s explanation of how moral revolutions happen by means of honor codes helps to clarify not only viewer sympathy and solidarity for this film’s African-American protagonist, but also viewer moral disgust at another important white character’s racism. In particular, the film encourages its more thoughtful white viewers to reconsider as well as potentially change their affective responses, ideological predispositions, and habits of perception and attention regarding race, thereby facilitating fundamental moral change and even the possibility of moral revolution.","[{""name"": ""Dan Flory"", ""affiliation"": [""Montana State University""]}]","[""10.1353/cj.1999.0001"", ""10.1111/hypa.12305"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780199552221.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jaac.12239"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2006.00230.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2010.01432.x"", ""10.3167/proj.2016.100202"", ""10.5840/filmphil2018222"", ""10.4324/9780429422508-7"", ""10.3366/film.2011.0023"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8303.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199756940.001.0001"", ""10.1353/book4715"", ""10.1515/9781438450179-003"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wpqm7"", ""10.1525/9780520943919"", ""10.1093/0199263655.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phc3.12137"", ""10.1002/9781119118527"", ""10.1515/nor-2017-0157"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.2010.00200.x"", ""10.1353/wan.1998.0036"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2006.00231.x""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"
10.1386/slac_00097_1,STUDIES IN SPANISH & LATIN AMERICAN CINEMAS,1303 Drama Film and Television,Disability and post-ETA poetics,"In this article, I explore the use of cultural emotions in state-aligned post-ETA poetics by analysing the role that illness and disability play in post-ceasefire filmic – Fuego/Fire (Marías 2014) – and literary – Patria/Homeland (Aramburu 2016) – representations of the Basque national conflict. Recent critical discussions interpret disability in Spanish film and literature as harbingers of inclusivity and cultural pluralism (Fraser 2013; Marr 2013). However, if placed in the intensely polarized context for media and cultural representations of the Basque conflict in Spain, disability plays a less salutary role. Concretely, I argue that the possibility of post-ETA closure is often envisaged via the spectacularization (and thus the instrumentalization) of disabled and ill bodies, which are used to ‘mobilize affect’ towards a series of state-sanctioned positions with regard to victimhood, forgiveness and post-conflict reconciliation.","[{""name"": ""Helena Miguélez-Carballeira"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000118820937 Bangor University""]}]","[""10.1080/09687599.2016.1257421"", ""10.1353/hir.2007.0031"", ""10.1080/14636204.2018.1456148"", ""10.1080/14636200500312367"", ""10.1080/17449057.2016.1218643"", ""10.1080/17449057.2016.1218644"", ""10.3828/jlcds.2010.13"", ""10.1353/jlc.0.0040"", ""10.3828/jlcds.2010.10"", ""10.3828/jlcds.2015.7""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Safety Research']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

This is a new step in a long-term project devoted to the issues of “mastering” geographical space through art, including the semiotics of spaces created by artists, sculptors, and architects. Among other aspects, the conference examined how art creates geographical images and fantasy worlds, which always have a trace of the real world’s spatial regularities. Since 1994, the project has existed in the form of collections of scientific articles, and since 2009—in the form of conferences as well. The project was conceived by Russian geographer Yury Vedenin, and later Olga Lavrenova, philosopher and culturologist, picked up the initiative. In recent years, the conference has been organized by the Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Arts, GIRT Film and Television School, and the Russian State University for the Humanities. In 2022, the Faculty of Geography and Geoinformation Technology of the HSE University joined the team of organizers. A separate section of the conference was dedicated to media, photo and cinema. There were reports on the historical and cultural aspects of creating virtual spaces, and on the images of the territories created by screen arts. Following the tradition, conferees considered the role of territorial factors in the formation of art schools and individual art works. This year, the discussions focused on digital media. An important place was given to photography as a tool for shaping geographical images and fixing them in time. The combination of a digital replica of the world with new landscape art creates a new augmented reality as a work of art. The geography of fashion and musical culture are also expressed in digital reality. A separate subject is the structures of chaos and order in cinema—the very concepts of space, which are yet another traditional talking point at the conference. These topics are in the mainstream of the discussion of semiotics of space created through art, as well as the geographical aspects of art development, including digital art.","[{""name"": ""OLGA A.

The growing interest in theatre for generating socio-political capacity-building among people gave rise to the Theatre of the Oppressed, conceptualized and developed by Augusto Boal. This article provides a brief outline of the modus operandi of Boal’s practice, and focuses on investigating the theoretical and practical methodology of Jana Sanskriti, the West Bengal group of practitioners of Theatre of the Oppressed. The article investigates the dialogical relationship between actors and audience in the three phases of the group’s theatre-making process: pre-performance; during the performance; and after it.

I problematize the simple calculation of deglamming, thinking more closely about the ways that celebrity structure raises challenges to actors and especially actresses attempting to engage with against-type characters. I turn specifically to three well-known examples of this trend: Charlize Theron in Monster (2003), Nicole Kidman in The Hours (2002), and Jennifer Aniston in Cake (2014). I argue that the process we see is not about deglamming (or getting ugly) for its own sake. Deglamming in these cases is a process of estrangement: from beauty, from the celebrity machine, from audience expectations. I draw on screen shots, film reviews and interviews to explore the relationship between deglamming and estrangement as a kind of acting and character technique, paying particular attention to the stakes for presenting historical characters in biopics. And while the three films I examine here – Monster, The Hours, and Cake – are often thought together as examples of actress Oscar uglification, they are actually quite different, both in terms of the physical transformations the actresses underwent in service of their characters, and the ways in which these transformations were understood and received.","[{""name"": ""Sharrona Pearl"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

The Tunisian feature film Tlamess can be read as queer on two levels. First, its queerness relates to the protagonist, a deserter who undergoes a fundamental metamorphosis: he frees himself from the patterns of military masculinity and, far from the normative world, takes on a maternal role. Second, the dissolution of the traditional gender and family order is staged through cinematic processes that introduce the viewers to a pre-verbal world outside of established symbolic and social patterns. Expressive audio-visual techniques transfer the viewers into this alternative world and create an experience of difference, a kind of mind game. Thus, queer cinema should not only be understood in terms of political activism, as an examination of characters supposedly deviating from gender norms. Rather, and crucially, it emerges in a much broader sense out of the strategies of aesthetic mise en scène.","[{""name"": ""Claudia Gronemann"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000010943599X University of Mannheim""]}]","[""10.1515/9781474463768-004"", ""10.1080/13629380308718494"", ""10.1386/fiin.8.1.18"", ""10.1163/9789004342828_008"", ""10.1163/9789401208789_017"", ""10.1515/9780748630929-013"", ""10.2307/2505169"", ""10.1093/screen/42.1.49""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Death has been considered the muse of philosophy and can also be considered the muse of film-philosophy. But what does it mean to say that to film-philosophise is to learn to die, or a kind of training for dying? Film is an artistic object that reminds us of death’s inevitability; it is a meditation on the transient and finite nature of time. Films as diverse as Mizoguchi’s Tales of Ugetsu, Resnais’s Hiroshima mon Amour, and Guzmán’s Nostalgia for the Light take an uncanny approach to the subject, expressing the paradoxical coexistence of life and death and of different temporal dimensions. This article explores the philosophical concept of the death-image and time through a Deleuzian approach to cinema, meditating on the flashback, the coexistence of the present and the past, and the emergence of a new type of Lazarean character – one who returns from the dead.

10.3366/film.2020.0140,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,Deadly Barks: Acousmaticity and Post-Animality in Lucrecia Martel's La cienaga,"Acousmatic sound is often defined as a sound whose source is unseen, that is, in terms of a separation between the senses of hearing and seeing. Discussions about the acousmatic have generally focused on the ontological relation between the sonic effect and the visually unavailable source that produces it. This article examines the function of acousmatic sound in Argentine auteur Lucrecia Martel's La ciénaga ( The Swamp, 2001), arguing that the film's distinctive employment of acousmatic sound and acousmatic listening constitutes a strategy of disruption, challenging the traditional concept of the “animal” – an ideological and oppressive notion produced by dominant Western philosophical discourse. My reading gives close attention to what seems to be the barking of an unseen dog and its effects on human listeners, contending that, as the semiotic stability of the figure of the dog gradually erodes within Martel's cinematic territory, listening to the canine voice becomes an unsettling sensory-cognitive experience; the sound of the barks presents an irresolvable epistemic problem. I draw on Jacques Derrida's late writings on nonhuman animals, borrowing the term animot, to argue that Martel's film brings into audibility an animality irreducible plural: an alterity exceeding logocentric economies of knowledge. The film's experimental aesthetics and construction of narrative, I suggest, are concerned with perceiving and making perception itself perceptible, while exposing the limits of human perception – impassable limits marked by an animality which gradually withstands conceptual domestication. Through its use of acousmatic listening, La ciénaga expands our perception of ecological ontology.","[{""name"": ""Andrea Avidad"", ""affiliation"": [""New York University""]}]","[""10.1215/9781478002536-010"", ""10.1215/9780822376774"", ""10.1353/hph.1987.0011"", ""10.1515/9780804767309"", ""10.7312/chio18588"", ""10.1215/9781478002536-006"", ""10.5209/rev_ARAB.2014.v14.n3.46427"", ""10.1163/9789401200493_003"", ""10.2307/j.ctv37wprjj"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780192803450.001.0001"", ""10.51644/9781554589067"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199347841.001.0001"", ""10.1093/screen/hjx038"", ""10.1215/9781478002536-007"", ""10.1525/9780520967465""]","['Psychology', 'Computer Science', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"
10.1215/02705346-9052816,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Daughter of Saul, or Saul Leanya: The Gendered Place of Atrocity in Laszlo Nemes's Son of Saul","Abstract László Nemes's 2015 production, Son of Saul (Saul fia), is one of the most critically acclaimed Holocaust movies to date. The film disrupts canonical notions of visual representation of the special squads of Jewish inmates, or Sonderkommando, forced to work in the crematoria. Simultaneously, it radically re-genders an exceptional survival scene recorded as autobiographical truth by witness testimony. A young Hungarian girl's survival of a Zyklon B gassing became exceptional among other incidents of survival in Auschwitz-Birkenau due to the medical assistance offered and the resuscitation administered by the Hungarian medical doctor of the crematoria, Miklos Nyiszli. Son of Saul effectively swaps the body of this teenage girl with the body of a boy in order to re-create a foundational patrilineal story of powerful ideological impact and legitimating force. Pursuing a project of reestablishing a hegemonic male discourse over the Holocaust, the film also portrays a female inmate as one of the four women who made the 7 October 1944 Sonderkommando revolt in Auschwitz-Birkenau possible by smuggling in the explosives for the insurgents. Ella's disconcerting neediness in the film seems uniquely misplaced onto a woman tortured by the Gestapo and hanged without having betrayed her accomplices. While Son of Saul offers its own remarkably successful solutions and modes of cinematic transcendence portraying the ultimate sites of extermination, it does not convey an adequate understanding of gender relations transformed by the historical context of the Final Solution and the vital role of women in the Jewish resistance to the Nazi-orchestrated genocide.","[{""name"": ""Szidonia Haragos"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['History', 'Social Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1386/smt_00107_1,STUDIES IN MUSICAL THEATRE,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Dance, mobility and social change in Billy Elliot: The Musical","Billy Elliot: The Musical addresses the issue of class that, while seldom analysed as a theme in Broadway musicals, has been a key trope of the majority of British musicals since the première of The Shop Girl in 1894. The article examines how the dialectic of dance as an emblem of individual freedom opposed to the rigidity of the British class system is expressed through movement within the mining community of Easington. By utilizing various aspects of Rudolf Laban’s effort theory, including the kinetic personality patterns of his associate, Warren Lamb, the article examines the cultural gendering of movement via the strict regimes of boxing (for boys) and ballet (for girls). With brief references to Bourdieu’s notion of habitus and Brecht’s praxis of Gestus, the article illustrates how Billy’s ability to embrace a supposedly ‘feminine’ kinetic vocabulary constitutes the flexibility to free himself from the rigid and inherently homophobic definition of conventional masculinity. In promoting movement beyond the confines of an outmoded tradition of working-class behaviour, Billy embraces a classless notion of postmodern masculinity represented in the bohemian milieu of the metropolitan artist. By ‘dancing’ his freedom for the Royal Ballet’s audition panel in ‘Electricity’, Billy embodies his own liberation from the repetitive pattern of movement that inevitably sends the miners to early graves while he flies upwards to defy the typical destiny of a miner. The article explicates key moments of movement and dance in order to exemplify the embodiment of the musical’s central tropes in kinetic terms.","[{""name"": ""Robert Gordon"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121916040 Goldsmiths, University of London""]}]","[""10.14361/9783839447734-011"", ""10.1080/19443927.2014.999109"", ""10.1386/smt_00107_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Music']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

IA in children and adolescents is of serious clinical concern for patients, families, and physicians, given the detrimental impact pediatric IA can have on development. Currently, the ability to properly identify, monitor, and treat IA behavior across clinical populations is hindered by two major roadblocks: (1) the lack of an assessment tool designed for and sensitive to the set of behaviors comprising IA, and (2) the absence of a treatment indicated for IA symptomatology. In this review, we discuss the clinical gaps in the approach to monitoring and treating IA behavior, and highlight emerging solutions that may improve clinical outcomes in patients with IA.","[{""name"": ""Adelaide S.

At what point does incorporating indigeneity in actor training become a tokenistic appropriation of marginalized cultures? Drawn from fieldwork as a 2019 Fulbright scholar at Toi Whakaari, New Zealand's National Drama School, I intersect training with culture and society. Using the Acting Program as a case study, I deploy an ethnographic methodology to address the aforementioned questions by investigating Toi Whakaari's bicultural pedagogy while positioning it as a reflection of New Zealand's national identity. I especially explore the school's implementation of Tikanga Māori, the practices and beliefs of the country's indigenous peoples. I argue that while some questions remain, Toi Whakaari integrates Māori forms in a manner that is culturally responsible and pedagogically effective, thereby providing a model from which other drama schools can learn.","[{""name"": ""PETER ZAZZALI"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-89767-7_10""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

The figure of Uuno is also a presidential parody that reflects the changing attitude in Finland towards those in power after the long administration of President Urho Kekkonen. As a historian, I have endeavoured to illustrate the ways comedy relates to the time period in which it was made.","[{""name"": ""Noora Kallioniemi"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000120971371 University of Turku""]}]","[""10.1177/1367549420960477"", ""10.5771/9783845297392-293"", ""10.1386/jsca_00076_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Music', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Se utilizó una metodología basada en la sociosemiótica, valorando tres planos: contextual y de referencia, de expresión y de contenido. Se revela una evolución del discurso desde el ideario franquista hasta valores relacionados con cultura, patrimonio y ocio. Los materiales generan una línea estratégica no planificada, influyendo en el discurso mediático de la promoción turística. Se concluye que los audiovisuales no publicitarios son una alternativa efectiva a la publicidad, adaptándose a nuevos paradigmas promocionales, entre información y persuasión.","[{""name"": ""Onésimo Samuel Hernández Gómez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Antonio Raúl Fernández Rincón"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pedro Antonio Hellín Ortuño"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.24265/turpatrim.2000.n1.11"", ""10.3989/estgeogr.201102"", ""10.1080/09669580208667167"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aar5255"", ""10.1086/225585"", ""10.6018/turismo.35.221641"", ""10.3406/comm.1983.1570""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

Special focus is placed on the challenges and opportunities arising from the digitalization of culture. It is highlighted that the digital creative industries offer significant potential for disseminating Chinese and Japanese narratives, showcasing a significant synergy between the creative sectors of these two countries. Additionally, the article notes that infrastructure invest-ments is an important part of the soft power strategies of both China and Japan, which is particularly significant given the pivotal role data and infor-mation technologies play in the success of content industries today. Draw-ing distinctions in how soft power is perceived in China and the US, it is sug-gested that China’s strategy stems from a unique understanding of culture that prioritizes community and blurs the sharp binary distinctions between private and public, tangible and intangible aspects. The argument is made that this cultural approach, combined with the allure of Chinese education and economic models, positions China’s strategy for success amidst the digital revolution and the advancement of artificial intelligence, especially resonating in Global South countries. With AI advancements potentially threatening to reduce numerous jobs, the narratives of economic empow-erment championed by China become increasingly appealing, especially in the Global South.","[{""name"": ""GEORGII PAKSIUTOV"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Yet there remains an underappreciation of the communicative processes in the social dynamics across different cultural contexts in these first romantic encounters using non-student samples. Of particular importance is the role of how partners balance the information needs of presenting themselves as a suitable partner while simultaneously assessing the suitability of their date as a potential mate. By doing so, a social exchange paradigm is often implemented in the process to find love. Through social penetration theory (SPT) as a predictive lens, I compare how couples on the first seasons of (n = 12) and (n = 10) moved through the stages of intimacy as a result of mutual communication. Textual analysis suggests that cultural variation in the communicative act of self-disclosure was less of a predictor than was the desire to form an intimate bond.","[{""name"": ""Mthobeli Ngcongo"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000010109131X University of Johannesburg""]}]","[""10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60371-8"", ""10.7227/CST.1.1.11"", ""10.1080/15295030802327774"", ""10.1177/1948550610373402"", ""10.1080/01494929.2020.1728003"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.12.019"", ""10.1080/02500167.2021.2001553"", ""10.1080/0363775042331302514"", ""10.1177/0093650207305235"", ""10.1111/j.1756-2589.2010.00052.x"", ""10.5817/DI2020-1-67"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6811.2012.01405.x""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Gender Studies', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

10.1017/S0266464X22000355,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,Critical Disengagement: The Epistemic and White Supremacist Violence of Theatre Criticism in Canada and the USA,"This article examines recent controversies sparked by the critical reception of work by Global Majority theatre artists in Canada and the USA, including Yolanda Bonnell, Yvette Nolan, and Antoinette Nwandu. It argues that, when faced with works that fall outside of their presumed expertise and experience, critics commonly resort to a strategy of critical disengagement, which displaces the focus from the work and refuses to evaluate it on its own terms. Through an analysis of case studies, we elucidate the concept of critical disengagement and its three distinct categories, ‘othering,’ ‘imposing’, and ‘self-staging’. These acts are representative of larger patterns in dominant theatre criticism practices, which are descended from neoclassical and Enlightenment formulations of criticism, and centre around the ideals of fair judgement and critical objectivity. When applied to the work of Global Majority theatre artists by a largely white critical establishment, they enact, consolidate, and reproduce what Gayatri Spivak calls epistemic violence. During this pivotal moment, as theatre communities in the Global North respond to calls for racial justice and decolonization, this article sheds light on the often overlooked role of criticism in sustaining white supremacy within theatre production and reception, and stresses the urgent need to re-imagine critical practices.

Without consistent infrastructures in place to support these artists, creative workarounds and new ways of creating have been developed. Becky Gold has worked with blind artist Alex Bulmer for nearly four years, navigating systems of support and accessibility (or lack thereof) within Bulmer’s various artistic projects. Together, they have come to an understanding about what support means to them and how it can best be nurtured and evolve from one project to the next. Drawing from their experiences of working together in Canada as well as from Bulmer’s previous experiences of support structures in the United Kingdom, this article highlights the need for support roles to be better understood as infrastructurally integral to the evolving culture of disability arts in Canada.","[{""name"": ""Becky Gold"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alex Bulmer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/10714413.2018.1472482"", ""10.1080/10714413.2018.1472482""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['Speech and Hearing', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Alors que l’historiographie s’est penchée sur les œuvres éducatives et sur les incursions dans le domaine du long métrage de la compagnie, cet essai examine ses films commandités portant sur l’extraction des ressources naturelles. Pendant des décennies, Crawley Films a fourni aux réseaux audiovisuels du Canada et d’ailleurs un vaste catalogue qui faisait valoir les priorités nationales et celles des entreprises en matière d’utilisation des terres, de procédés industriels d’extraction et de colonisation. En se penchant sur l’industrie de l’aluminium et sur le film Generator 4 (1956), réalisé par Crawley Films pour Alcan, cet essai montre comment de telles productions, en films 16mm et 35mm, ont été reformatées selon les médias et les usages dans le cadre d’une infrastructure médiatique canadienne qui dépendait de l’infrastructure industrielle et en faisait la promotion.","[{""name"": ""Charles R.

10.3167/proj.2022.160103,PROJECTIONS-THE JOURNAL FOR MOVIES AND MIND,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Cranes, Drones and Eisenstein A Neurohumanistic Approach to Audio/Visual Gestures","In this article, a neurohumanistic, “third culture” approach to “gesture” is delineated. Grounded in an exegesis of Eisenstein’s sensorimotor theory and extending to both contemporary and historical thinkers, a “constellation” of the notion of both visual and musical gestures is triangulated and operationalized into empirical research. An overlap between Eisenstein’s model of audio/visual gestures and the contemporary frameworks of embodied simulation theory and embodied music cognition is revealed. Through artistic collaborations with a filmmaker and a film composer, custom-made, naturalistic video clips (filmed with a drone) and musical tracks were created using the film The Cranes Are Flying (Kalatozov 1957) as an aesthetic model. Empirical results demonstrate an increased sense of movement and involvement in the perception of both visual and musical “ascent.”","[{""name"": ""Anna Kolesnikov"", ""affiliation"": [""Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Parma, Italy""]}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"
10.1017/S0266464X21000014,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,Covid Conversations 2: Anne Bogart,"Maintaining and nurturing an ensemble theatre have been Anne Bogart’s foremost concerns in these past near-thirty years since she and Tadashi Suzuki founded the Saratoga International Theatre Institute (SITI) in 1992. Suzuki had established the Suzuki Company of Toga (SCOT) in 1976, making a secluded mountainous landscape of Japan its home to this day. Bogart’s venture in the United States, although inspired by Suzuki’s model of a production-based troupe of high artistic standards that, at the same time, developed its unique training methods, by no means merely duplicates its predecessor. In this Covid Conversation, Bogart briefly maps a segment of SITI’s history, reflecting on the company’s inter-arts endeavours with differing dance idioms and its engagement with Greek tragedy. She discusses the effects of the Covid pandemic on her troupe, also interrupting its performances of The Bacchae at the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis. Her most recent opera production, Tristan and Isolde, was closed for the same reason at the Croatian National Theatre – a key work in her portfolio of nineteenth-century grand opera as well as contemporary avant-garde opera. An acclaimed theatre director, Anne Bogart runs and teaches the Graduate Directing Programme at Columbia University in New York. At the SITI summer school in Saratoga, she and the company have workshopped the Viewpoints method that she has elaborated from Mary Overlie’s six principles for theatre and dance training. Bogart’s international workshops have further developed her method. She is the author of A Director Prepares (Routledge, 2001) and of many influential books that include (with Tina Landau) The Viewpoints Book (Theatre Communications Group, 2004). The Art of Resonance is forthcoming (2021, Bloomsbury). Maria Shevtsova is the Editor of New Theatre Quarterly whose most recent book is Rediscovering Stanislavsky (Cambridge University Press, 2020). The following conversation took place on 27 August 2020, was transcribed by Kunsang Kelden, and was edited by Maria Shevtsova. It is followed by a short coda announcing the transition of SITI into a resource centre.","[{""name"": ""Anne Bogart"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maria Shevtsova"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

They have received cursory, if not denigratory, treatment from Shaw’s biographers for their perceived role in his last years. This article seeks to rescue their reputations and show how their company, after the death of Charlotte Shaw, filled a role in Shaw’s life. By recounting the couple’s earlier lives, it makes clear how much they had in common with Shaw and why he found them satisfying conversationalists. Shaw’s interactions with the Winsten family revived his interest in art patronage and in Pygmalion-style experiments in the development and education of their children. The text identifies the artworks and books, which were created by the couple as a result of their relationship with Shaw, with the aim of rescuing them from later Shavian intellectual snobbery.

The film comprises archive footage shot by Swedish television crews in Africa between the mid-1960s and 1987. It pairs images with extracts from Fanon’s book, read by singer and activist Lauryn Hill. This assemblage both celebrates African campaigns of liberation and complicates the claim to be ‘here and now’ embedded in archival material by overlaying it with a retrospective (often melancholic) vantage point, that of a postcolonial moment. On occasion, Concerning Violence comes close to reproducing a temporal framing that consigns Black Africans to the symbolic immobility critiqued by Fanon and, more recently, Achille Mbembe. How does the film endeavour to avoid this?

10.1386/jicms_00084_1,JOURNAL OF ITALIAN CINEMA AND MEDIA STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Coming of age in Milano: Ermanno Olmi from sponsored cinema to feature filmmaking,"This article argues that a full understanding of Ermanno Olmi’s feature films will require a deep engagement with the sponsored cinema he made as director of the Sezione Cinema Edisonvolta. It begins by spelling out some of the stakes and challenges of a ‘sponsored turn’ in Italian cinema studies, which during the past decade has inaugurated the long archival and critical process of revaluing the corporate roots of auteurs like Michelangelo Antonioni, Bernardo Bertolucci and, to a certain extent, Ermanno Olmi. It then elaborates on the relation between Olmi’s sponsored cinema (1953–61) and feature filmmaking (1961–2014) by analysing two films that mark the director’s transition from the small to big screen: Michelino 1 a B (1956) and Il posto (1961). The central contention is that these films tell two different versions of the same coming-of-age story: a young boy from the provinces finds work in a downtown office building, where he must come to terms with the fact that he will remain there all his life. The distance between the two films is a measure of Olmi’s own coming-of-age as an intellectual: from a resolved promoter of the guiding role of business in modern life to a sceptical interrogator of white-collar mundanity. After a comparative reading that reveals general similarities of structure and specific scenes of quotation, the article concludes with some remarks about education, a concept through which Olmi’s feature films show themselves to be aware of – even commenting on – sponsored cinema.","[{""name"": ""Jim Carter"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419367558 Boston University""]}]","[""10.1080/02614340.2019.1589273"", ""10.1386/jicms.7.2.199_1"", ""10.1386/jicms_00084_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'General Arts and Humanities']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7038), ('1301 艺术学', 0.7023)]]"

Both films follow Spaniards who emigrate in the wake of the economic crisis. While Perdiendo el norte follows a tradition of comedic españoladas (typically Spanish films), employing the familiar foil of Germany, Perdiendo el este introduces China as an economic challenger. Perdiendo el norte borrows heavily from its predecessor, Vente a Alemania, Pepe/Come to Germany, Pepe (1971), but ultimately flips the script on Vente’s nationalist nostalgia, advocating for greater transnationalism. Perdiendo el este, on the other hand, reinscribes a nationalist agenda by framing the Chinese as incompatible with Spanish national identity.

The COVID-19 crisis has tested EU’s reputation of solidarity and partnership to the Western Balkans, with Balkan political leaders accusing the bloc of selfishness due to its decision in 2020 to restrict exports of medical equipment to candidate states and the perceived neglect of the region during the vaccine distribution in early 2021. Simultaniously, China sent planes containing tonnes of medical supplies, respirators, medical personnel, and later vaccines, that would be received with great pomp and live media coverage, in a powerful public diplomacy and vaccine diplomacy offensive. This paper argues that this helped improve public opinion and reshape narratives on China in the Western Balkans. Still, attitudes vary between states, with Serbians having the most favourable views on China as a foreign partner. On the other hand, while public perceptions on China have seen a positive shift in Macedonia and Albania, this has not translated in a change in their pro-EU stance.","[{""name"": ""Mare Ushkovska"", ""affiliation"": [""International Balkan University, Macedonia""]}]","[""10.1057/s41254-022-00266-2"", ""10.1177/0920203X231155148"", ""10.1057/s41254-021-00224-4"", ""10.3390/healthcare10071276"", ""10.1057/s41254-022-00258-2"", ""10.1163/1871191X-BJA10071"", ""10.1007/s12140-021-09382-x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The study thus demonstrates that the alterations found in the series are both genre-related and explicable in terms of cultural-filtered interpretations, as can be seen in the negotiation of the protagonist as a Christian damsel-in-distress, combining melodramatic tropes, a signifier of westernization and a domesticating rationale of her alleged passivity.","[{""name"": ""Maria Chiara Oltolini"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000109413192 Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore""]}]","[""10.1111/cccr.12122"", ""10.1080/02690055.2020.1721124"", ""10.1353/uni.1998.0025"", ""10.3390/arts7040059"", ""10.1023/A:1022419120433"", ""10.1353/chl.0.0131"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01485-8_9"", ""10.1386/josc_00068_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Yet, to understand characters as migrants who go through journeys of acculturation when they are adapted for the screen may enhance understanding of both the characters’ potential and problems that may arise during the development process. This article proposes that the development of characters and their processes – as fictional beings – can be understood through the use of models that describe real migrants’ adaptation processes. Using Christopher Hampton’s screenplay drafts for the film Atonement (2001), it outlines how such migratory journeys go hand in hand with screenwriters’ problem-solving processes. The article thus develops the idea that migrating characters, in their capacity as fictional beings and the thematic issues that they represent, both adapt to and appropriate their new media environments; simultaneously, they are appropriated by new creative forces and by the conventions of those new media environments, who in turn must adapt to the characters in this process of bi-directional acculturation.","[{""name"": ""Joakim Hermansson"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000103046002 Dalarna University and Gothenburg University""]}]","[""10.1353/nlh.2007.0038"", ""10.1080/002075997400629"", ""10.1093/screen/23.1.3"", ""10.1002/jocb.003"", ""10.1386/josc.7.1.11_1"", ""10.1386/josc_00014_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Gender Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

The article examines three works made by a photographer and two filmmakers, respectively, based on their artistic interactions with their respective archives. Their works were brought to annual workshops in 2019 and 2020 organized by Reframing Africa, co-hosted by the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) and the Market Photo Workshop in Johannesburg. The central objective of Reframing Africa continues to be lobbying for the preservation, restoration and repatriation of films made by African filmmakers on the continent and in the diaspora. But there has also been growing interest among participants in the colonial and other racially inflected archives of the moving/still image. The main title of the article, ‘Can the archive restore you?’, is intended to echo that of Nigerian filmmaker Onyeka Igwe’s short film No Archive Can Restore You (). The article argues that the engagement by the authors of the three works with deeply problematic visual archives has produced significant insights into their construction and the ways in which they represent ‘reality’ and ‘truth’. Each of the three artistic interventions does suggest how even the bleakest archival materials, however, can be used as the basis for activating the restorative potential of the archive.

In terms of his views on medicine and science, philosophy and religion, the answer has to be “no.” On economics and politics, the issue is more doubtful, but there too, probably, the answer must also be “no.” It is hardly surprising that it should be so. Shaw was born in 1856 and lived almost half of his long life in the reign of Queen Victoria. Many of his opinions were formed early, and though modified and developed later, almost never fundamentally altered. Times change and we change with them, so all of seventy years after Shaw's death in 1950, it might well be expected that the immutable Shavian positions should look outmoded.

Drawing on Afrokology as decolonial perspective, this article examines the discourses and narratives on Africa that were produced by African news organizations. Data were drawn from ten news organizations from Ghana, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Egypt. A quantitative corpus analysis and a qualitative critical discourse analysis were used to analyse the COVID-19-related stories.

This is the most comprehensive source for British film costs in the early 1930s. The evidence provided by the ledger suggests a more nuanced overall picture of the costs of British film-making than the standard narrative of ‘quality or quota’ would allow.

It does so via a combination of original archive research (conducted at the BFI Reuben Library) and interviews with several industry figures with relevant professional experience, including John Barclay, the current Head of Recorded Media for the UK trade union Equity, and Roger Harrop, the former director of regional film commission Herts Film Link. Using these methodologies, the article identifies Band of Brothers as the first significant US runaway television production in the UK, and uncovers how this HBO programme came to benefit from British film tax relief. Here, close attention is paid to dubious practices concerning tax policy and contractual agreements for actors, especially Damian Lewis's pay. The article demonstrates the impact Band of Brothers has had on television production in the UK in terms of providing Equity with a useful precedent when negotiating for subsequent international productions such as Game of Thrones (2011–19). Band of Brothers offers important and timely lessons to be learned, especially given the recent growth of US television runaway productions in the UK.","[{""name"": ""Simone Knox"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13688800903395460"", ""10.1080/10286632.2016.1223636"", ""10.1525/luminos.10"", ""10.1080/01439685.2013.847653"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2012.0094"", ""10.1080/10286632.2016.1223646"", ""10.3998/mij.15031809.0001.203"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2015.0243"", ""10.5040/9781474248600.ch-010"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190663124.003.0012"", ""10.1525/luminos.25"", ""10.5040/9781838711122"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190663124.003.0010"", ""10.1177/0163443719831597"", ""10.3366/E174345210900065X"", ""10.1177/1367877907076776""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Dafa’s work is on the boundaries of visual arts, puppetry, music, family gathering, food and a range of different elements. The idea of the puppet is something that you can touch and sense, yet it is on the borders between reality and fiction. There is always the possibility that the gates of imagination can be opened by this object, which can have many symbolic meanings. In this article, a reflection transcribed from an interview with Laura Purcell-Gates, Husam and Réka discuss their work with puppetry in communities. They reflect on layers of meaning within the puppet, working with specific materials and found objects, the importance of cultural specificity in their approach to the work, decolonizing practices of puppetry and building community through integrating puppetry, gatherings and shared food. This artistic discussion is an insight into a very active company working with often vulnerable and displaced communities.","[{""name"": ""Husam Abed"", ""affiliation"": [""Dafa Puppet Theatre, Prague""]}, {""name"": ""Réka Deák"", ""affiliation"": [""Dafa Puppet Theatre, Prague""]}]","[""10.1386/atr_00031_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Museology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

10.1093/adaptation/apad026,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Beyond Historicity: Aesthetic Authenticity in Cinematic Adaptations of Non-/Anti-Realist Fiction,"AbstractThe literature on authenticity in adaptation studies seems to be focused almost entirely on adaptations of either historical and (auto-)biographical literary texts or non-fiction narratives. The usual case studies are often generically limited to heritage and historical films, period dramas, documentaries, and biopics, to the exclusion of non-/anti-realist genres. However, there is more to adaptation than empirically and/or historically verifiable source texts, which warrants an examination of authenticity in adaptations of fantastical, science-fictional, and gothic fictions away from the fixation on historicity and veracity. This paper proposes an aesthetic (metadiscursive and experiential) outlook on authenticity in genre adaptations, namely George Miller’s adaptation of A. S. Byatt’s ‘The Djinn in the Nightingale’s Eye’, Three Thousand Years of Longing (2022); Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Ted Chiang’s ‘Story of Your Life’, Arrival (2016); and the different adaptations of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. Metadiscursively, authenticity depends on the self-consciousness of artistic representation, the extent to which the source text and its cinematic adaptation acknowledge their status as fictional narratives and their representational, medium-specific limits and potentials. Experientially, authenticity is judged by the degree of audience immersion in the storyworld, the feeling (generated by diegetic techniques) that what they are watching is experientially plausible despite the implausibility of the genre itself. Without lapsing in excessive realism and verbatim fidelity, an authentic adaptation is heedful of the paradoxes surrounding authenticity itself in any fictional narrative, attentive to their aesthetic and thematic treatment in the source text, aware of the representational affordances of the literary and cinematic media, and capable of offering the audience an immersive experience.","[{""name"": ""Yosr Dridi"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tunis , Tunisia""]}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv1nzfgns.6"", ""10.1515/9780773591035"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apv011"", ""10.1215/10407391-14-3-89"", ""10.3366/film.2018.0084"", ""10.1163/9789401200691_006"", ""10.1515/transcript.9783839417577.41"", ""10.1515/transcript.9783839417577.9"", ""10.1515/transcript.9783839417577.237"", ""10.1515/transcript.9783839417577.261"", ""10.1080/713657675"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52854-0_1"", ""10.1515/transcript.9783839417577.25"", ""10.1525/9780520341562-014"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apn018"", ""10.1353/crt.2004.0001"", ""10.1093/screen/hjy053"", ""10.1525/9780520341562-015"", ""10.1515/transcript.9783839418192.intro"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayl040"", ""10.1093/adaptation/apx009""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

In the film, neighbours Leonardo and Víctor fight over the building of a window in Víctor’s apartment that will face Leonardo’s home and modern architecture exemplar, the Curutchet House – a house built by renowned architect Le Corbusier. The tension between Leonardo and Víctor can be better understood as a tension between the global and the national, and how their particular perspectives match how they see the Curutchet House itself, either as non-place or place. The article proposes the non-place/anthropological place entanglement as a useful tool to understand how subjects interact with a given space, and how such interactions can be read as favouring one type of relationship or another, space as place or space as non-place, in practices of textual critique. Reading El hombre de al lado, this article pays close attention to how the protagonists, Víctor and Leonardo, occupy space in the film, whether as place or non-place, and read this contingent relationship as a commentary on the tension between the global and the national.","[{""name"": ""Camilo A.

This special section looks at Betsuyaku’s career from his early 1960s plays to his monumental 2007 work Yattekita Godot (Godot Came). The essays look at Betsuyaku’s relationship with the Theatre of the Absurd, both in Japan and in the West. This is especially true when one looks at the influence of Beckett and how Beckett was received in Japan. In this introductory essay, I argue that the perception of absurdism, inimically linked with tragedy, missed the connection to comedy, especially entropic comedy. Betsuyaku’s works are filled with this comic form wherein bodies, identities and social structures fall to decay and dissolution. Even as these bodies and structures decay, however, a dark humor pervades in Betsuyaku’s work; seeing his work through this comedic lens allows for greater understanding and appreciation of this major playwright.","[{""name"": ""David Jortner"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The article will include accounts from designers and directors, and also critical reaction to the set designs. It will be argued that the creative flexibility offered by Betrayal's dramatic structure means that the play will continue to be staged in new, fresh and innovative ways.","[{""name"": ""George Cole"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3138/md.23.3.238"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5rdx7r"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-31567-0""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Conservation', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Interestingly, characters in the early works of Shaw, his five novels, also feel the sting of censorship, albeit in differing degrees from those in his dramas. Because Shaw's works, both plays and novels, that were suppressed often feature harsh indictments of established society, they become, in effect, proto-modern, as he attacks class, gender, and religious norms of his day.","[{""name"": ""Lagretta Tallent Lenker"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

Liberal ironism, a dialectical synthesis of liberalism and contingency, asserts that humans can commit themselves to privileged causes even in the face of radical uncertainties in theory and practice. Jesusian pragmatism, a synthesis of Christian agape and pragmatist tenets, asserts that Jesusian social values compose the ethical core of a pragmatism dedicated to providing global wellness.

The Repertory’s tours increased Macdona’s ambitions, which led to extended runs in London and Paris through 1924. While such actions irritated directors of permanent repertory theaters, Shaw did not discourage Macdona’s efforts.

Sin embargo, variables como el tipo de colegio, la familia o la edad del alumno/a pueden estar influyendo negativamente en el mantenimiento de algunos mitos en torno principalmente a la omnipotencia o la perdurabilidad del amor.","[{""name"": ""María Goenaga Ruiz de Zuazu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1152/jn.00838.2004"", ""10.1017/S1138741600005461"", ""10.17979/reipe.2018.5.2.3624"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.107.1.3"", ""10.17060/ijodaep.2017.n1.v2.917"", ""10.1174/021347495763810938"", ""10.1177/1367877910391868"", ""10.3989/ris.2014.i1.557"", ""10.25115/raudem.v4i0.1736"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00354.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijchp.2014.10.004"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6811.1996.tb00123.x"", ""10.1080/03637751.2013.776697"", ""10.1353/mat.2008.a247497"", ""10.12795/AdMIRA.2018.01.01"", ""10.5209/rev_HICS.2013.v18.44000"", ""10.6018/rie.35.1.257191"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00315.x"", ""10.1590/S0104-026X2007000300006"", ""10.1174/021347413806196708"", ""10.3989/ris.2017.75.3.15.171"", ""10.1111/j.1741-3729.2000.00071.x"", ""10.1177/0265407589064001"", ""10.1177/0265407599166009"", ""10.1177/1077800414537206""]",['Social Sciences'],['Gender Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

The first analyses little known interviews with Iñárritu before he made his career in feature films that document his practice in radio, advertising and television drama. These interviews focus on his early conception of the relation between art and commerce and his views on the Mexican media scene in the 1990s. The second half of the article analyses the rare primary materials themselves: radio commercials, television idents and, at much greater length, his first feature-length fiction film, an experimental drama made for Televisa in 1995 called Detrás del dinero/Behind the Money. The conclusion argues that even as Iñárritu has more recently distanced himself from broadcasting, his later career as an artistic and commercially successful feature film director embodies a precarious balance between artistic innovation and mass culture and a focus on the audience which he first learned in his early work in advertising, radio and television.","[{""name"": ""Paul Julian Smith"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate Center, ISNI: 0000000122985718 City University of New York (CUNY)""]}]","[""10.1386/slac_00033_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science']","['Communication', 'History', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"
10.1215/02705346-10772617,CAMERA OBSCURA,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Becoming User: Oracle, Barbara Gordon, and Representations of the User in Popular Culture","Abstract This essay considers the figure of the “user” as an emergent subject of late twentieth-century US culture, in relation to the World Wide Web and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. The user is a subject position that is historical in the sense that use relations have always determined social formations within capitalism, but it has been newly energized in contemporary modes of capitalism after digital computing, and newly weighted in contemporary renderings of the nation-state as service provider. This essay turns to a cultural moment in which a privatized user subject was coming into formation, using comic books of this moment to find the user figure and its stories. The DC Comics archive might not seem the most likely place to find answers to these concerns. But superhero origin stories are always about becoming user in late capitalist imaginaries. Superheroes learn to use their histories to reproduce the world they want. The then newly inaugurated DC Comics character Oracle, aka Barbara Gordon (formerly Batgirl), is becoming a wheelchair user and a computer user. Reading Oracle's 1990s user origin stories, this essay attends to scenes of wheelchair and computer use to work out a theory of user history and user time emerging in 1990s US culture. The comics reveal that the process of becoming user is always intersecting with the processes of becoming a racialized, gendered, classed, (dis)abled subject. They also open up the possibility for other affordances: becoming user as a process which can be torqued in its unfolding.","[{""name"": ""Zara Dinnen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

Such concerns reverberate the most in Othello (1604) and The Hateful Eight (2015). Although critical scholarship about both works abounds, this essay offers an alternative approach by consulting the thoughts of Jean Baudrillard on the issues of hyperreality, criminality, and terrorism. The dialogue between the three can be important in two ways. First, it establishes a link between Early Modern and contemporary culture by engaging three canonical figures. Second, it provides a novel commentary about each artistic piece by drawing on the profound ways (hyper)reality and villainy can function. The essay also discusses the (non-voluntaristic) crises of reality that follow, when opposing parties battle for the ultimate power.","[{""name"": ""Pouria Torkamaneh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Farhad Poordakan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pedram Lalbakhsh"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

This article reviews the scholarship, in order to bring together histories, definitions and distribution of sketch comedy from which to investigate how this form of comedy screenwriting can contribute to feminisms that ‘engage openly and playfully with humor and irony as weapons of choice’ (Willet et al. 2012). Drawing on anecdotal accounts and available archives from A Black Lady Sketch Show (2019–present), French and Saunders (1987–present), Inside Amy Schumer (2013–present), Wood &amp; Walters (1981–82) and others, this article considers these against the theories of writing sketch comedy to draw some conclusions on how this short form, combined with its most popular form of distribution, can accommodate multiple perspectives and serve their audiences. This article offers itself as a starting point in identifying the unique challenges and strategies for women writing sketch comedy, and the possibilities offered by the form more broadly, while highlighting the need for further empirical exploration of the creative practice of female sketch comedy writers, and further critical attention to short form comedy screenwriting.","[{""name"": ""Stayci Taylor"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121633550 RMIT University""]}]","[""10.1509/jmr.10.0353"", ""10.1177/1367549409352272"", ""10.1177/1527476419852241"", ""10.1353/vlt.2011.0018"", ""10.1353/vlt.2011.0020"", ""10.7560/314517-009"", ""10.1177/1329878X17708842"", ""10.1386/cost.2.2.173_7"", ""10.1080/2040610X.2017.1280257"", ""10.7560/314517-001"", ""10.1080/10304312.2017.1313388"", ""10.1080/07491409.2017.1368763"", ""10.1353/sor.2012.0047"", ""10.1386/josc_00039_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Gender Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

In post-apartheid South Africa, these questions, markers of apartheid temporality, are embodied in, among other sites, the representation of battered Black bodies in cinema. This article critiques the characterization of Blacks as narrative spaces to illustrate the temporality of distress and trauma from apartheid to post-apartheid Johannesburg in Gavin Hood’s Tsotsi. It argues that the film posits Black characters as latent archives of intergenerational historical narratives that probe the apartheid past and speculate on the post-apartheid future in the city of Johannesburg. Consequently, the juxtaposition of embodied narrative archives and apartheid temporality, the article posits, is a crucial model in the theorization of battered Black bodies’ contiguous nostalgia.","[{""name"": ""Addamms Mututa"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419371151 University of Cape Town""]}]","[""10.1017/S0307883317000062"", ""10.1080/13696810701760435"", ""10.1080/13696810701485967"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a097774"", ""10.1057/9781137263902_1"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2630403""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

In turn, a fractured (comm)unity results, where social violence and inequality are perpetuated. This article places El regreso into dialogue with Laura Podalsky’s ideas on affect in Latin American cinema, Michael Billig’s banal nationalism and Julia Kristeva’s abject in order to explore how the film’s proposal might be reframed on more sustainable terms.

Barbara Bray, whom Beckett met at the BBC in 1956, was then a script editor. At the BBC she translated, adapted and produced a great many texts from the French language. Beckett offered his help with this, as is testified by his lengthy and detailed remarks on Bray’s version of The Square by Duras in an unpublished 1957 letter. In return, it is likely he was influenced by Duras through the agency of Bray. What is more, the correspondence attests to the fact that Bray extensively and systematically helped Beckett with self-translating. Investigation of this collaborative translation highlights the minoritising process (Deleuze) that the art of (self-)translation involved for both Bray and Beckett via Duras.","[{""name"": ""Pascale Sardin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/pan.2016.0000"", ""10.5040/9781501329722"", ""10.1163/9789401204422"", ""10.1163/18757405-03001007"", ""10.1075/btl.131"", ""10.1163/9789004358096"", ""10.4000/books.apu.5911"", ""10.1163/9789401211635_009"", ""10.1515/tran-2017-0005"", ""10.1057/9781137481146""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

From its beginnings in the late 1960s until the end of the1980s, BITEF was a representation of the dominant multicultural, modernist, and progressive paradigm of Yugoslavia’s cultural policy. This was not an unambiguous position. On the one hand, modernist values were imposed by Tito’s authoritarian regime and, on the other, they were confronted with the conservative tendencies both in politics and the arts. As a multicultural and progressive platform, BITEF was one of the biggest victims in the field of the arts of Slobodan Milošević’s nationalist regime in the 1990s and the wars in former Yugoslavia. After the fall of Milošević in 2000, a complex period of tension started between the ‘reborn’ urge for democratization and internationalization, on the one hand, and persistent nationalism and conservatism, on the other. Due to its tradition, reinforced artistic ambitions, and international reputation, BITEF regained its fame. Its position today, however, is quite paradoxical. It is an anti-traditionalist and multicultural festival – within a culture and society that are becoming traditional and rather claustrophobic. Ivan Medenica is a Professor of Theatre at the University of the Arts in Belgrade in Serbia and has received the national award for theatre criticism six times. His publications include The Tragedy of Initiation, or the Inconstant Prince: The Classics and Their Masks. Medenica is also the artistic director of BITEF.","[{""name"": ""Ivan Medenica"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Cultural Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1093/adaptation/apac014,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Autonomous Art, Heterogeneous Heterotopias: Barry Jenkins' Cinematic Adaptation of James Baldwin's If Beale Street Could Talk","Abstract Offering a comparative analysis of James Baldwin’s original 1974 novel If Beale Street Could Talk and the 2018 cinematic adaption directed by Barry Jenkins, this essay argues that the film adaptation successfully reconstructs the novel’s depictions of racial injustice and contemplations of heterotopias as sites for potential Black agency but creates notable slippages from the novel’s positions on religion, family, and gender. On the one hand, Jenkins closely follows Baldwin’s social protest theme and retains discursive contemplations of the street and prison as heterotopian spaces where systemic racism occurs but can also be protested. On the other hand, Jenkins’ adaptation centralizes Black romantic heterosexual love to the point of diminishing Baldwin’s messaging about the need for family solidarity, the need for humanist solidarity, and the danger posed by fundamentalist religion to Black family solidarity. Jenkins’ adaptation widens Baldwin’s perlocutionary influence among people who would be uninterested in reading a novel but who would be willing to see a film, and potentially triggers audience members into thinking about the existential crisis of Black people in an anti-Black world, but would also be more societally helpful if it retained Baldwin’s messages about hypocritical religiosity, family solidarity, and gender equality.","[{""name"": ""Longyan Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Longhai Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/adaptation/apn015"", ""10.7227/JBR.5.12"", ""10.2307/3185543"", ""10.2307/464648"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5rf3s4"", ""10.2307/j.ctvnwbxpj"", ""10.2307/467340"", ""10.4324/9780203957721"", ""10.1111/j.1542-734X.1985.0804_11.x""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.3138/cjfs.29.1.04,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FILM STUDIES-REVUE CANADIENNE D ETUDES CINEMATOGRAPHIQUES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Auto-histoires et representations communautaires dans le cinema des femmes autochtones,"In the last decade or so, cinema has revealed itself to be an ideal medium for the transfer and/or remediation of the spoken word as well as stories coming from oral tradition and Indigenous culture. Indeed, cinema is a place of expression which favours cyclical creativity and contributes to the decolonization of stereotyped images propagated by external voices that do not understand the subtleties of languages (real and symbolic) that are anchored in indigenous peoples’ cultural memory. By exploring indigenous cinema as practised by women of diverse nations, this piece demonstrates how cinema can induce the compression and dilation of time, to bring to the audience the fluidity of a story that has been reconfigured according to a new time and carried by spoken words that have chosen to either emancipate themselves from the image or to materialize themselves in it. Furthermore, this article illustrates how a new generation of Indigenous women use cinema to retrace and/or rewrite their personal narrative with the help of autobiographical or collective stories that travel back in time to fill in the blanks left by a fragile memory and to express their will to make peace with a difficult colonial past. Finally, the writings of Lee Maracle ( I Am Woman, 1988) and Natasha Kanapé Fontaine ( Manifeste Assi, 2014) are being brought forth to show how films such as Suckerfish (Lisa Jackson, 2004) Bithos (Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers, 2015) and Four Faces of the Moon (Amanda Strong, 2016) contribute to the individual and community healing of Indigenous peoples of Canada, through an aesthetic of reconciliation. The exploration of these works, therefore allows us to shed light on and better understand the roles/internal mechanisms of visual autobiographies in the larger context of reconciliation with individual and collective stories/memories.","[{""name"": ""Karine Bertrand"", ""affiliation"": [""Queen’s University""]}]","[""10.18584/iipj.2019.10.1.1"", ""10.1515/9780887553615-007"", ""10.4000/erea.4119"", ""10.17953/aicr.35.4.ch5u144q02746t46"", ""10.1163/9789042028838"", ""10.18584/iipj.2019.10.1.1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

However, democratic institutions in many countries have backslid. Scholars debate neoliberalism’s impacts and the rise of oligarchs concentrating wealth and distorting democracy. This review analyzes 50 sources from 1990-2020 through meta-analysis. Literature is assessed regarding neoliberalization’s mechanisms and effects. Privatization concentrated assets in politically-connected oligarchs, enabling state capture constraining competition. Deregulation empowered economic elites with disproportionate political influence, distorting representation toward oligarchic over public interests. Evidence partially supports the hypothesis that neoliberalism benefiting oligarchs distorted democracy, contributing to backsliding. However, grassroots resistance offers alternatives.

10.3138/ctr.190.009,CANADIAN THEATRE REVIEW,1303 Drama Film and Television,Augmented Reality ASL for 11:11 at Theatre Passe Muraille,"In November 2020, Theatre Passe Muraille produced a workshop as a part of their Accessibility Labs (funded through the Toronto Arts Council’s Open Door Project). This workshop connected the development of Samson Bonkeabantu Brown’s play 11:11, directed by Tsholo Visions Khalema and choreographed by Mafa Makhubalo, with a collaboration between technology collectives Toasterlab and Cohort to experiment with the use of augmented reality to support the American Sign Language interpretation and live captioning in consultation with Courage Bacchus, Marcia Adolphe, and Carmelle Cachero, Jenelle Rouse, and Gaitrie Persaud. The collaborators spent a week building an interpretation distribution system that used affordable technology to create a proof-of-concept experiment to see what it would look like to move both text and sign interpretation from just offstage into the visual field of the performance. Using Cohort’s media distribution app developed for the synchronous delivery of media to mobile devices, this project explored live and pre-recorded versions of performance interpretation for a Deaf audience. These were displayed on the audience’s phone screens and in simple augmented reality headsets. The goal was to explore expanding the opportunities for an audience to access interpretation, making the experience more customizable through different forms of engagement, and seeking to provide more universal access across all performances by making a recorded alternative available. The workshop also explored the dramaturgical and scenographic implications of adding this information into the direct visual field of an audience member. This article, in the form of a compiled oral history of the workshop, documents the process, the findings, and the follow-up questions that the team identified over our short time together to provide a baseline for further exploration into the use of mixed-reality technologies in support of accessible performance spaces. It considers situated identity and Deaf culture in relationship to translating interpreted performance to a technological solution as it both outlines the practical steps that allowed this to happen and explores artist, interpreter, and technologist perspectives on what was learned.","[{""name"": ""Ian Garrett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tsholo Visions Khalema"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Samson Bonkeabantu Brown"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Courage Bacchus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jacob Niedzwiecki"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Indrit Kasapi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1162/pres.1997.6.4.355"", ""10.1109/SVR.2012.10""]","['Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Geology']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)]]"
10.1017/S0040557421000557,THEATRE SURVEY,1303 Drama Film and Television,At-Home Humbugs: Freaks and Fakes in the Nineteenth-Century Parlor Museum,"In April 1885, aNew York Heraldjournalist rushed to Madison Square Garden for a special reception highlighting Jo-Jo, the Dog-Faced Boy. A feature of P. T. Barnum's traveling show, Jo-Jo was confounding scientists who had requested a stand-alone inspection of the mysterious attraction. Accordingly, the reporter provided an anthropological description of the boy: “He stands about five feet high. . . . His whole body is covered by a very thick growth of long, tow colored hair . . . and the peculiar formation of his head [is] very suggestive of the Russian dachshund.” At first, Jo-Jo appeared docile, but as the scientists prodded him more and more, he started “snarling, showing his three canine teeth” and asked his guardian if he could bite the inspectors. Jo-Jo was decidedly not a dog-boy, or not exactly. He was, in fact, a Russian teenager suffering from hypertrichosis, a condition causing excessive hair growth all over the body, including nearly every surface area of the face. Barnum had signed him to perform a year earlier, and the boy made quite an auspicious debut. However, Jo-Jo was simply the latest in a long line of supposed hybrid species and exotic curiosities that Barnum had been displaying since midcentury. The famed showman built his name in part by presenting human creation itself as a continual spectrum. Barnum's attractions ranged from live tigers and giraffes to enigmatic simian performers to wax statues of America's degraded lower classes. As much of a draw as he became, even Jo-Jo had to share a bill with Tattooed Hindoo Dwarfs, Hungarian Gypsies, Buddhist Priests, as well as a menagerie of animals including baby elephants, kangaroos, lions, and twenty-foot-long “great sinewy serpents.” But Jo-Jo's specific appeal was tied to his inexplicability. Even given the closer inspection of the dog-faced boy, “none of the physicians present would hazard an opinion as to his ancestry.”","[{""name"": ""Michael D'Alessandro"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctt1pwt6f0"", ""10.1353/wan.1996.0016"", ""10.1353/aq.2015.0011"", ""10.2307/361638"", ""10.1353/jer.0.0136""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"
10.1386/slac_00100_1,STUDIES IN SPANISH & LATIN AMERICAN CINEMAS,1303 Drama Film and Television,As if Franco had never existed? The intrusive past in Pedro Almodóvar's Tacones lejanos/High Heels (Almodóvar 1991),"Pedro Almodóvar’s film Tacones lejanos/High Heels (1991) portrays the interconnectedness between past and present in early 1990s Spain, when the country had seemingly become a modern nation and left the Transition behind. While in the 1980s Almodóvar had famously mentioned that he preferred to make films as if Franco had never existed, this work suggests otherwise. Tacones lejanos portrays a protagonist suffering a traumatic personal experience in her childhood during Spain’s dictatorship and its enduring impact on her present life in the early 1990s. The film employs cinematic devices such as flashbacks, memory triggers and dialogic relations with earlier films as tropes of memory. By studying individual memory to understand the workings of collective memory and national identity, I argue that Tacones lejanos provides an analogy to comprehend an unprocessed trauma and constitutes a symbolic illustration on how Spanish society at that time was dealing with its past, depicting it as something eventually inescapable which must be addressed.","[{""name"": ""Abraham Hernández Cubo"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123226764 King’s College London""]}]","[""10.1111/1469-8219.00005"", ""10.1163/9789004483224_003"", ""10.1353/hrq.2005.0034"", ""10.3989/hs.2013.055"", ""10.1086/340890"", ""10.1080/10509208309361157"", ""10.1080/10509209109361386"", ""10.1016/S0193-953X(18)30439-8"", ""10.1163/9789004483224_006"", ""10.1215/03335372-2006-016"", ""10.7195/ri14.v9i3.105"", ""10.1080/146362004000282127""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Religious studies', 'History', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

10.3138/md-65-1-1166,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Artaud's Surgical Theatre: War, Medicine, and Regeneration","In 1916, as the adolescent Antonin Artaud was treated for “war neurosis” in a military hospital, he witnessed the birth of modern plastic surgery. These procedures, which rearranged injured bodies in new constellations of flesh and bone, helped to inspire Artaud’s first theatrical foray. “The spectator,” he writes in 1926, “will go to the theater the way he goes to the surgeon.” I argue that literal surgical practice is crucial to Artaud’s surgical metaphors. Plastic surgery revealed to Artaud the body’s plasticity: its capacity to morph, regrow, and heal. While the physical culture movement in interwar France promoted militarized and medicalized models of the body, Artaud used surgical motifs in his plays, poems, and films to explore how physical and mental habits might be dissevered and how they might regenerate. Although Artaud ultimately considered his attempts at theatrical surgery to have failed, I conclude by looking at current applied theatre work with US military veterans, which has been shown to transform participants’ neural networks – performing, as Artaud would put it, a kind of “brain surgery.”","[{""name"": ""Warren Kluber"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1386/jaah.9.3.337_1"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2016.06.004"", ""10.3138/9781442656819"", ""10.1080/23268263.2017.1390036"", ""10.31887/DCNS.2000.2.1/macrocq"", ""10.1515/9780748635054"", ""10.1017/S0307883310000568"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92249-2"", ""10.2307/1432672"", ""10.2307/1146659"", ""10.1215/00104124-3327503"", ""10.3138/md.50.4.500"", ""10.3726/978-3-0353-0773-3"", ""10.3998/mpub.345778"", ""10.5040/9781350495036"", ""10.4324/9781315197678-8"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199277490.001.0001"", ""10.1353/tj.2020.0031"", ""10.5040/9781474204712"", ""10.1080/23268263.2020.1743502"", ""10.1215/00267929-64-1-71"", ""10.1016/S0094-1298(20)30267-4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199695577.001.0001"", ""10.3138/md.0517"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198700937.001.0001""]","['Neuroscience', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Medicine']","['History', 'Neurology']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7465), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7432)]]"

Since the rise of Arduino and 3D printing in the mid-2000s, do-it-yourself approaches to the creative exploration of technology have surged in popularity. But the maker movement is not new: it is a historically significant practice in contemporary art and design. This book documents, tracks, and identifies a hundred years of innovative DIY technology practices, illustrating how the maker movement is a continuation of a long-standing creative electronic subculture. Through this comprehensive exploration, Garnet Hertz develops a theory and language of creative DIY electronics, drawing from diverse examples of contemporary art, including work from renowned electronic artists such as Nam June Paik and such art collectives as Survival Research Laboratories and the Barbie Liberation Organization. Hertz uncovers the defining elements of electronic DIY culture, which often works with limited resources to bring new life to obsolete objects while engaging in a critical dialogue with consumer capitalism.

In this chapter, we will attempt to provide a non-exhaustive map of the field of interpreting technology in different settings, of research on these new technologies and research using them. Tools and resources that enhance an interpreter’s performance will also be discussed as part of technological evolution, while the final question to be answered is whether “interpreters [can] survive in an AI-dominated world” (Downie 2020). This contribution wants to be a call to do more large-scale research and to inform future interpreters better about technological development and opportunities in the classroom.","[{""name"": ""Heidi Salaets"", ""affiliation"": [""KU Leuven, Antwerp Campus""]}, {""name"": ""Katalin Balogh"", ""affiliation"": [""KU Leuven, Antwerp Campus""]}]","[""10.52034/lanstts.v20i.611"", ""10.1075/btl.129"", ""10.30827/sendebar.v27i0.3834"", ""10.1075/intp.15.2.03bra"", ""10.1515/eujal-2016-0002"", ""10.1075/btl.149.03bra"", ""10.1177/1470357212446409"", ""10.1163/9789004351790"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2016.04.008"", ""10.1075/btl.149.04boe"", ""10.12807/ti.109202.2017.a02"", ""10.1075/btl.8"", ""10.1075/intp.00051.gum"", ""10.1057/9780230593442"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2021.08.024"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2rh2bs3.7"", ""10.1075/btl.149.08kry"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2018.05.006"", ""10.2190/TW.38.2.d"", ""10.1075/tis.00019.int"", ""10.7202/003634ar"", ""10.7202/011014ar"", ""10.1075/intp.8.1.04mou"", ""10.1075/intp.18.2.06ozo"", ""10.1075/hts.4.tea2"", ""10.4324/9781315678467"", ""10.4324/9781315649573"", ""10.1075/btl.149.02poc"", ""10.1075/btl.129.07pol"", ""10.7202/017983ar"", ""10.1075/intp.12.2.05roz"", ""10.1075/intp.13.2.02see"", ""10.1075/target.25.1.03see"", ""10.1075/intp.00030.see"", ""10.1075/intp.00030.see"", ""10.52034/lanstts.v20i.622"", ""10.1075/ais.10.12vra"", ""10.1075/btl.149.09vra"", ""10.1080/0907676X.2020.1770816""]",['Health Professions'],['General Health Professions'],"[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Using these primary sources, this article explores the reasons why Mei presented traditional Chinese theatre differently in each context. One reason was winning popularity among specifically targeted audiences, as indicated by the carefully selected programmes, explanatory discourses, and illustrations from promotional materials. Through a comparative examination, this article argues that, for the American tour, Mei made traditional Chinese theatre an emblem of ancient Chinese art, while, for the Soviet tour, he endorsed the Soviet Union’s social and artistic enterprises, labelling traditional Chinese theatre a modern art.

Lloyd Corrigan, US, 1931). The on-screen collision of these two stars associated with the imaginary East reveals incongruities between a homogeneous Orientalist image and heterogeneous—culturally acquired, professionally trained, mechanically reproduced, and gendered—yellow voices. Situating the star personae of Wong and Hayakawa in the geopolitical environments of the interwar era, the essay foregrounds the plasticity of voice as a form of cultural capital fetishized as an exchangeable commodity through the heavily marketed product of the new sound cinema. In this case study, the accented voice serves also as a contact point between European, American, and Asian film industries. A close analysis of the differently accented yellow voices in Daughter of the Dragon demonstrates the artificial homogeneity of the Orient embodied by the supposedly “authentic” stars of Asian descent and complicates the established configurations of the gendered “Orientals”: the Janus-faced Japanese man and the ornamentalist yellow woman.","[{""name"": ""Xin Peng"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Gender Studies', 'Cultural Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

After embedding both film and novel in intertextual webs that far exceed their putative relationship to each other, the article explores in detail two of the ways in which The Periwig-Maker transmutes its adapted text: first, its complex sound design, instantiating the plague’s soundscape that can only be faintly intimated in Defoe’s print-bound work; second, its gothic mode, hyperbolizing what is only one of a wide array of generic options followed in the Journal. The final section of the article extends the afterlives of both film and novel by considering them as fictions that, eerily, not only look backwards to the plague in the seventeenth century but forward to our own experience of deadly pandemic with COVID-19.","[{""name"": ""Andrew Dix"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, School of Social Sciences and Humanities, Loughborough University , UK""]}, {""name"": ""Sara Read"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, School of Social Sciences and Humanities, Loughborough University , UK""]}]","[""10.1057/9780230235427"", ""10.1353/lm.2003.0006"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16579-7"", ""10.1353/crt.2004.0001"", ""10.1525/rep.2004.87.1.82"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107294424.012"", ""10.1353/lm.2021.0030"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521849624.014"", ""10.4324/9780203805251""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

10.3366/film.2021.0156,FILM-PHILOSOPHY,1303 Drama Film and Television; 0101 Philosophy,Andre Bazin's Eternal Returns: An Ontological Revision,"The recent publication of André Bazin's Écrits complets (2018), an enormous two-volume edition of 3000 pages which increases ten-fold Bazin's available corpus, provides opportunities for renewed reflection on, and possibly for substantial revisions of, this key figure in film theory. On the basis of several essays, I propose a drastic rereading of Bazin's most explicitly philosophical notion of “ontology.” This all too familiar notion, long settled into a rather dust-laden couple (“Bazin and ontology”) nonetheless retains its fascination. Rather than attempting to provide a systematic reworking of this couple along well established lines, particularly those defined by realism and indexicality, this article proposes to shift the notion of ontology in Bazin from its determination as actual existence toward a more radical concept of ontology based on the notion of mimesis, particularly as articulated, in a Heideggerian mode, by Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe. This more properly ontological concept, also paradoxically and radically improper, is shown to be at work already in Bazin's texts, and it allows us to see that far from simplistically naturalizing photographic technology, Bazin does the contrary: he technicizes nature. If Bazin says that the photograph is a flower or a snowflake, he also implies that, like photographs, these are likewise a kind of technical artifact, an auto-mimetic reproduction of nature. Bazin likewise refers to film as a kind of skin falling away from the body of History, an accumulating pellicule in which nature and history disturbingly merge. This shifted perspective on Bazin's thinking is extended further in reference to Georges Didi-Huberman on the highly mimetic creatures known as phasmids, insects that mimic their environement. I extend this into the dynamic notion of eternal return, an implicit dimension of Bazin's thinking, clarified here in reference to Giorgio Agamben and the “immemorial image” which, like Bazin's “Death Every Afternoon,” presents an eminently repeatable deathly image, an animated corpse-world that can be likened to hell.","[{""name"": ""Jeff Fort"", ""affiliation"": [""University of California, Davis""]}]","[""10.1080/0969725X.2018.1497283"", ""10.1093/screen/hjq053"", ""10.1515/9781438460871"", ""10.1080/0969725X.2012.747333"", ""10.1086/448682"", ""10.2307/778643"", ""10.4000/1895.4537"", ""10.1086/505375""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['History', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

A comparative view towards Iphigenia at Aulis by Euripides (405 BC) raises the question of how story elements of that play are recreated within the film adaptation. Also, it seeks to explore the relationship between the type of engagement, from hypotext (play) “telling” to hypertext (film) “showing”. The theoretical framework of the article utilized theories of Gerard Genette’s “hypertextuality” and Linda Hutcheon’s “adaptation”. The results indicate subtle thematic connections, as well as a significant interplay between hypotext and hypertext. The Killing of a Sacred Deer represents an adaptation with a creative interpretation, one which reimagines the forms and themes of ancient tragedy in a modern-life context. Various influences, imitations and transformations of Euripides’ story elements are interwoven in the adaptation process and discussed in the article.","[{""name"": ""Poya Raissi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Morteza Ghaffari"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

The goal was to faithfully recreate the episode in a way that lays a claim to authenticity. This article examines the process and product and asks, with reference to television historiography, whether it achieves its goal of authenticity and what ‘authenticity’ might mean in this context. Ellis and others discuss the estrangement felt when viewing television from earlier decades. This article discusses the ‘feedback loop’ involved in knowing that the episode was made recently whilst assessing it as if it had been made in the past. The estrangement the viewer feels is therefore a sign that the episode is succeeding in its task of staying authentic to its era. But is it possible to completely abandon the knowledge of its contemporary production and lose oneself to the experience of viewing?","[{""name"": ""Philip Braithwaite"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121673843 University of Central Lancashire""]}]","[""10.1353/crt.2005.0002"", ""10.1386/jptv_00046_1"", ""10.1386/jptv_00060_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

Employing Christine Mayor’s embodied tableau method, it examines the experience of a Black drama therapist viewing Jeremy O’Harris’ Slave Play three different times – twice in the context of predominantly white audiences and once with a predominantly Black audience. The research question was ‘how does racial composition of the audience impact the experience of witnessing Slave Play for the Black drama therapist?’ What I found was that witnessing performances about racial trauma in predominantly white audiences increased my feelings of discomfort, invasive exposure and decreased capacity for presence. Conversely, witnessing performances about racial trauma during a BLACK OUT theatre performance fostered and inspired connection, joy and presence. These relational–cultural complexities underscore the necessity of considering audience composition, engagement and responses when exploring topics related to racial trauma in performance. They furthermore underscore the relational potentials of theatre audiences for drama therapy performances and beyond.","[{""name"": ""Britton Williams"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368753 New York University""]}]","[""10.1177/1326365X19864477"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2014.04.007"", ""10.1080/14779757.2016.1172252"", ""10.1080/02630672.2012.657944"", ""10.1016/S0197-4556(03)00026-1"", ""10.3149/jms.2201.12"", ""10.2307/3041778"", ""10.1386/dtr_00003_1"", ""10.1386/dtr_00124_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Conservation', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1386/jptv_00129_1,JOURNAL OF POPULAR TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,An anti-colonialist and feminist Sandokan?,"This article offers an anti-colonialist and feminist reading of the 1976 Italian TV miniseries Sandokan. Produced at the height of political radicalization in Italy, this series is arguably an expression of the anti-colonialist spirit of the time. In addition, this series is remarkable because it hit an audience record which was probably never reached again: almost 30 million viewers in a country of 60 million. Sandokan is a Malaysian nobleman who becomes a pirate after the British slaughtered his family. Though he certainly fits within the Robin Hood trope, Sandokan not only robs the rich to give to the poor, but he also takes back from the British what they are stealing. Apart from the anti-colonial slant, the miniseries is of interest because of its gender aspects. In the series, a few White women assertively challenge both male and colonial supremacy. Finally, one crucial aspect of the series which has so far been neglected is interracial love, represented by the union of Sandokan and the White Lady Marianna. While their sentimental and physical love defies nineteenth-century racial-colonial relations, it cannot last because of Marianna’s death.","[{""name"": ""Marco Gabbas"", ""affiliation"": [""Milestone Institute""]}]","[""10.1086/493603"", ""10.1163/22138617-07601007"", ""10.15201/hungeobull.66.3.4"", ""10.1097/00000441-200204000-00009"", ""10.1017/S0165115300003442"", ""10.1080/10646175.2012.695637""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Iranian rites and performing arts, as a part of Iranian art and culture, which has always got attention throughout history, can help us recognize ancient Iranian culture and history. Cinema, among other interactive arts, has sometimes been able to portray ritual arts well. Travellers movie, made by Bahram Beyzai, is one of the most prominent examples of the visualization of ritual arts in Iran, because the movie consists of three parts, like the three theaters, in which the rites are portrayed as the main story of the movie, and the Persian culture and customs have been exhibited. This paper, which its research method is descriptive-analytical, examines the standing of rites and ritual arts in Travellers movie and analyzes its atmosphere regarding to performing rituals. Its scene design changes as the script process, so that the application of elements such as light and color, and their intensity and reduction in different mental conditions, from pleasure to mourning, has been considered wisely, and the atmosphere has a dramatic impact on the audience in different scenes. The lighting and the coloring of the scenes in the movie, indicates a tribute to beliefs and faith in rites and ritual arts.","[{""name"": ""Shiva Khalili Kolahian"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

By examining its use in relation to notions of novel adaptation (Whelehan; Leitch) and approaching irony in the film as a rhetorical device (Booth; Hutcheon; MacDowell), this article counterpoints the opinion (Travers; Cahir) that the voice-over narration might have decreased the dramatic potency of Scorsese’s work. In doing so, two main hypotheses emerged: (1) displaying a voice that purposefully invokes the novel’s author might have enhanced the degree of association between adaptation and source material, and (2) in deepening the viewers’ understanding of certain scenes by revealing inside information, the voice-over adds an ironic overlay to the film.","[{""name"": ""Cynthia Beatrice Costa"", ""affiliation"": [""Federal University of Uberlândia""]}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226065595.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781118312032.ch6"", ""10.4324/9781315690254-33"", ""10.1002/9781118312032.ch23"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199331000.001.0001"", ""10.3366/film.2018.0076"", ""10.1002/9781118512876""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Adapting Being and Time for a phenomenology of cinematic experience, Loht accurately describes how various existential structures of Dasein are “fostered” by the projected world of film: in Loht's account, being-in-the-world is extended in the film experience. Loht's project offers fertile ground for developing the phenomenological basis of film experience. Yet, Loht anchors this account of film experience primarily in Heidegger's early philosophy; this leaves his adaptation not without challenges. First, if the structure of film experience is mapped too closely onto the notion of Dasein projecting itself into the filmworld, this theory presents the risk of taking the early Heidegger's “hands-on” approach too literally. Moreover, in its concern for Dasein's extensions into the world of film, Phenomenology of Film says little about the distinctly mediated character of filmworlds; this leaves ambiguous where the film experience effectively takes place.","[{""name"": ""Ludo de Roo"", ""affiliation"": [""Macquarie University""]}]","[""10.1525/9780520943902"", ""10.2307/j.ctv25p442v"", ""10.3167/proj.2019.130204"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0211026"", ""10.3366/film.2020.0126"", ""10.1353/nlh.2012.0027"", ""10.1163/9789004460874"", ""10.1093/screen/hjn086"", ""10.1093/screen/hjs007"", ""10.5040/9781350181960.ch-005"", ""10.1515/9780691213279"", ""10.1525/9780520937826"", ""10.1080/02699930903498186"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1gr7d6q.5""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Shaw chooses to equivocally demystify Shakespeare on the one hand and, on the other, eulogize him as the greatest of authors that ever lived. His ambivalent attitude to the poet is best expressed in his replacing of the fifth act of Cymbeline with his own version, Cymbeline Refinished, 1936 because he found in the original, “a tedious string of unsurprising dénouements sugared with insincere sentimentality.” Shaw concludes his adapted version with lines about the necessity of English and Roman syncretism. This article will attempt to study the dynamics of Shaw’s adaptation of Cymbeline, which, along with The Tempest, marked Shakespeare’s concluding vision of British history during the reign of James I.","[{""name"": ""Rupendra Guha-Majumdar"", ""affiliation"": [""Delhi University, India""]}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

In this article, Mick Wallis maps such promotion across various fields of practice at their intersection with the village drama ‘movement’ as a field itself. These include gentry patronage, post-war and rural reconstruction, adult education, and women’s self-advancement. He also charts the emergence of interwar village drama from its precursors since 1900, and the emergence from it of the system of local government Drama Advisers that persisted until the 1990s. Time and again, drama is presented as a vital tool in the improvement of the lives of individuals, the development of national citizens, and the restoration and celebration of local communities. Finally, he suggests the important insights that this work can offer future researchers.

We argue that the annotated play-text can be connected to four other playbooks by William Shakespeare and James Shirley that have been previously associated with seventeenth-century amateur theatricals, and that the new evidence provided by the Jonson text points plausibly to a practice of amateur performance at and around Gray's Inn in the middle of the century.","[{""name"": ""Tom Harrison"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Loxley"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['History', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

10.1386/ac_00039_1,ASIAN CINEMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,"Affect, blankness, theatrics: Rurality and faciality in three Chinese instances","The face and the close-up have been central to film theory since its early days. If modern visual theories of the face arose in Europe amid urbanization and imperial encounter, in the People's Republic of China (PRC), the political aesthetics of faciality became central to Maoist mass mobilizations of the countryside, in part through collective village film screenings. Bringing together themes of faciality, rurality and anxieties of global encounter, this article considers how the rural has been staged through genres of the face in Chinese cinema and television. Through close readings of the Maoist era The Youth of Our Village, Jia Zhangke’s Still Life and Zhao Benshan Media’s series Rural Love Story, I consider three distinct deployments of the face in depictions of rural and environmental transformation. Thinking with while also departing from Deleuze’s formulations in Cinema 1 and Cinema 2, the article traces an emotively intense face reminiscent of the affection-image, a blank face that operates in part as a time-image and a performative face of what might be called a theatrics-image. Across its readings as a site of affective immediacy, despotic inscription, moral character and social–political manoeuvring, the face offers a multivalent site for political, aesthetic and affective mediation, on- and off-screen.","[{""name"": ""Emily Ng"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000084992262 University of Amsterdam""]}]","[""10.1086/689657"", ""10.1386/jcc.6.2.153_1"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac30.1.0003"", ""10.1215/0094033X-2680801"", ""10.1353/mod.1997.0003"", ""10.1017/S030574101100066X"", ""10.1080/00043079.2016.1150755"", ""10.1525/aa.1944.46.1.02a00040"", ""10.1386/jcc.1.1.63_7"", ""10.1215/10679847-11-3-647"", ""10.2753/CLG0009-4609250481"", ""10.1386/ac_00039_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Philosophy', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

Thisarticle offers a comparative study of two Danish groups, SIGNA and Sisters Hope, and one Swedish group, Poste Restante. The visual dimension of theperformances by these three groups is striking, which may be partly attributed to the interconnections between the artists that has allowed a flow of ideasand strategies to occur between one group and the other. Looking at these connections, it appears that there is a line going from SIGNA (established in2001) to Poste Restante (established in 2007) and to Sisters Hope (established in 2014). Whilst there are similarities, there are also great differences in termsof the aesthetics and dramaturgies of these groups, which reflect political, ethical, and ideological differences in the context of Nordic societies.

10.30628/1994-9529-2024-20.1-13-42,NAUKA TELEVIDENIYA-THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,Adventure Silent Cinema and the Soviet Anthropological Project,"The article aims to explore the role of national cinema in the early 20th century and its contribution to the development of the Soviet anthropological project. Any significant transformation of society involves the human factor. This factor can be observed in two ways: as a consequence of changes, which shape the new social experiences acquired through individual socialization, and as the unique qualities of those organizing the transformations. The beginning of the 20th century marked a period of active formation of mass society, urban lifestyles, and entertainment industries. Within this landscape, cinema held a special, perhaps even crucial, position—probably due to its accessibility and the condensed intensity of content presentation. The adventure genre, in particular, played a dominant role and greatly contributed to the success of film distribution. The interplay between commercial and creative aspects has been influential in shaping the development of cinema from its inception. However, during the Soviet era, the balance between entertainment and creativity began to shift, influenced by socio-political circumstances. Firstly, there was an increasing emphasis on social themes in films. Secondly, by the 1930s, these circumstances had evolved into direct political pressure, significantly impacting the content requirements for films and even the fate of their creators. This resulted in a clear contradiction: while cinema content portrayed the ideal of an initiative, responsible, and creative individual, in reality, individuals, including film authors, were expected to conform to ideological requirements. This contradiction between the broadcast content and the real lives of people led to the squandering of the resources of the anthropology project and the creative potential of cinema. Nonetheless, it did not impede the development of models and technologies that shaped the personalized power of mass society, which have retained their significance to this day. Hence, cinema, which initially emerged as a form of entertainment with adventure genre for a dominant, not only played a role in shaping the concept of the “mass man,” but also laid the groundwork for the models and technologies that defined a “person in power.”","[{""name"": ""GRIGORII L.

Comparisons were examined between participants who either just saw a musical that centred on the theme of racism, or who saw the same musical and partook in a post-show experiential workshop that used restorative justice practices and drama therapy/applied theatre exercises. The results established that participants who saw the show and attended the post-show workshop (n = 38), in comparison to participants who only saw the show (n = 69), significantly (p = .001) agreed that the combined experience allowed them to reflect on biases and other forms of discrimination. Researchers also discovered that age and gender yielded considerable differences across groups. Additionally, there were five themes that were derived from the applied thematic analysis. Participants reported: (1) increased knowledge; (2) that they felt emotions; (3) that they connected with others; (4) that they experienced personal transformation in the here and now; and (5) that they were inspired to enact change. These qualitative themes supported quantitative analysis, which concluded that, while the theatre experience alone was impactful, the workshop augmented the central message and cultivated participants’ deeper reflections.","[{""name"": ""Michelle Chamblin"", ""affiliation"": [""Molloy University, United States""]}, {""name"": ""Shalinie Sarju"", ""affiliation"": [""Molloy University, United States""]}, {""name"": ""Laura L.

This article explores Kazuo Ishiguro’s references to Ugetsu in The Buried Giant to reflect on the realistic portrayal of ghosts as a way to reveal a suppressed pagan narrative. Using materials from the Ishiguro archive, I argue that Ishiguro borrows tactics from Ugetsu and then incorporates the Japanese Buddhist myth and folklore underlying Sansho Dayu to build a hidden discourse of the dead that subverts the dominant discourse of God, creating an implicit supernatural plot that parallels the novel’s explicit realistic plot and that decentres Britain’s national beliefs.","[{""name"": ""Anni Shen"", ""affiliation"": [""English Department, College of Foreign Languages and Cultures, Xiamen University""]}]","[""10.1075/ni.19016.kra"", ""10.5040/9781838711313"", ""10.2307/j.ctt4cgpqc"", ""10.1353/art.2018.0036""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

Similar to Gupta’s own writing, Syal has addressed cultural hybridity in her work and exposed the faultlines within British society, thus bringing into the open a racialized sense of the nation that is embedded in the entanglement of its colonial and postcolonial history. This article discusses Gupta’s appropriation of Anita and Me (2015) as a significant contribution to consolidating an Asian British women’s writing tradition that through transmedial and intertextual strategies favours legacy and canon formation. By dramatizing Syal’s coming-of-age novel Anita and Me, originally published in 1996, Gupta expands this work beyond both its original narrative form and its context of publication. She infuses it with an afterlife that sheds new light on the novel, while strengthening its relevance for contemporary cross-cultural audiences.","[{""name"": ""Giovanna Buonanno"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Modena and Reggio Emilia Modena Italy""]}]","[""10.5040/9781350206229.00000004"", ""10.1017/9781108164146.032"", ""10.1017/CCO9781316488546.005"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-29481-4_15"", ""10.5040/9781408162804"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719078323.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CCO9781316488546.003""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

The case charted novel contours of intellectual property rights with regard to “talking picture” adaptation. Shaw would, in the course of preparing for this particular trial, discover that stunning acts of plagiarism had already occurred in the musical adaptation of Arms and the Man, entailing consequences for its prospective transfer to film. Although it caught the attention of the press at the time, the protracted legal dispute receives scarce mention in the scholarly conversation around Shaw’s life and writing. A much fuller account of it, however, emerges from the archived casefile of Shaw’s London solicitors, newly acquired by David Grapes.","[{""name"": ""Christopher M.

The study explores the phenomenon of audiovisualization of cabaret culture in silent films of the 1900s to 1920s, examining how it conveyed the concept of the tape to viewers. Notably, there have been no Russian studies dedicated to examining the influence of cabaret on early cinema. In contrast, Western film critics have predominantly focused on the role of cabaret performers, perceiving early cinema as an art form characterized by hysteria, a logical extension of cabaret and its various forms of entertainment. This paper aims to demonstrate, however, that the inclusion of cabaret poses and gestures in films was intentional, serving to enhance the viewing experience and reflect upon the socio-cultural phenomena of the turn of the century, as well as to provide a means of exposing mores through a distinct gestural neurotic system. The research findings indicate that early cinema, particularly films featuring cabaret dances, functioned as polycode texts, accumulating blocked or previously experienced memories through actions and images. It can be argued that the tendency and attraction to the primitive, which was popular in the 1910s and 1920s, first manifested itself in the grassroots dances and was audiovisually expressed through dance movements. The cancan initially incorporated a pathological gestural language, which later became associated with regression in the context of its convergence with African dances, mesmeric practices, and quack discourse.","[{""name"": ""DARIA O.

In this essay, Jean Ma argues that Days signals both a return to form and a reorientation that responds to a changing landscape of moving image projection beyond the traditional movie theater. With no subtitles and nearly no dialogue, Days eschews narrative conventions and continues the tendency toward reduction and minimalization that is omnipresent in Tsai’s body of work. Instead, Tsai explores what Ma calls “the unfathomable screen presence of the body” through one body in particular—that of Lee Kang-sheng, to whom Tsai refers as his muse and collaborator. The continuous physical inscription of Lee across Tsai’s body of work, invites a study of not character but rather shifting projections of presence, modes of being and doing before the camera that constitute the foundational building blocks of Tsai’s artistic project.","[{""name"": ""Jean Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

For centenary history of the industry’s development, a wealth of factual material has been accumulated and it needs systematization and conceptualization, however classical music is rarely noticed by media researches. The exception is the formative stage of musical broadcasting with organization of the first symphony’s and opera performances’ broadcasting. Meanwhile, there’s a lot of topics, discussion of which can not only interest theorists, but make a significant practical difference. Particular emphasis should be given to the filling of musical air, analyzation of which will help to identify new horizons of applied musicology and to correct radio stations’ strategies. Even though the radio of classical music outlines trends which are specific for academic art in general, there is a number of specialties arising from the nature of mass-media. Duality like this distinguishes the structure of its program too, the quality of which can not be evaluated without taking into account the functional specific of radio. The work of different broadcast’s filling is based on unified principles in accordance with certain set parameters, which helps to choose from basis and form in playlists the compositions of certain styles, genres, characters, duration, connecting them with the elements of sound design and the hosts’ commentaries. Nevertheless, undeniable artistic merit of the content not only ineffective radio of classical music and don’t give them considerable advantages over competitors, but overshadow it to the end of rating. At the same time behind the imaginary easiness of adhering the FM-standards hides the danger of homogenizing the important characteristics of airing compositions, which calls into question the possible realization the humanitarian mission of the classic radio, including the save of cultural heritage, musical education and creative development. In this situation just technology can’t guarantee the result, so it is important to create multi-level approach to the research of radio’s ‘Classical’ format as a original artistic phenomenon and a effective instrument of cultural policy.","[{""name"": ""Tatiana A.

It aims to bring to light the nuances of the film, which were overlooked within Soviet film studies, while also highlighting the key differences between Alexei Tolstoy’s original novel and its cinematic adaptation. The Martian storyline, reimagined as the fantastical realm of engineer Mstislav Los by the screenwriters, can be interpreted as the subconscious of the intellectual hero of the 1920s in order to explore its symbolic meaning. The Martian landscape not only embodies governmental conservatism, but, through its constructivist style, symbolizes modernity, a technologically advanced civilization, as well as reflects concerns that come not from the past, but are projected towards the future. The paper analyzes the interplay between the fears and dreams of the intellectual protagonist, whose values were shaped before the 1917 revolution. Unlike his literary counterpart, the screen image of Los has changed: in the film, the engineer is an active man, an adventurer, a person of passion. The ethereal Aelita, the sovereign of Mars, is juxtaposed to Los’ wife, Natasha, a Soviet bureaucrat. While Natasha embodies the democratic ethos of an energetic Soviet woman, Aelita personifies aristocratic ideals. The emotional openness, energetic movements and tactile interactions, and active work and social contacts—the Soviet anthropological ideal—stand in contrast to the personal convictions of Los, who aestheticizes emotional restraint, interpersonal detachment, and social elitism. The article explores the motifs common to the Moscow and Martian storylines: the yearning for interplanetary connections, the need to transcend the usual mode of life in pursuit of something new, different, unattainable, and the willingness to make sacrifices for loftier objectives. In summary, the screenwriters have radically transformed the world of Tolstoy’s novel, which manifests the impotence of an individual in the face of revolutionary turmoil and emotional depression over the loss of a beloved one. Protazanov’s film underscores the importance of active participation of not only the Red Army soldier (Gusev), but also the intellectual (Los). While aligning with certain tenets of Soviet ideology, the film also contains subtexts that challenge it. Such is the (imaginary) revolution on Mars, which turns out to be driven not by a collective awakening among the working people of Mars, but rather by the individualistic ambitions of two Earthly men: the inertia of soldier Gusev’s ardor and the jealousy of intellectual Los, his detachment from with his Soviet wife and his yearning for emotional and erotic solace with a woman of royal lineage. The article surveys critical and theoretical analyses (both domestic and international) on Aelita, revealing motifs resonant with the Western European cinematic trends of the 1920s and of subsequent decades, from auteur (Robert Wiene, Fritz Lang, Andrei Tarkovsky) to popular science fiction films and series of the early 21st century (Cloud Atlas, Dune, Foundation, etc.). This reconfirms the scale of Protazanov’s Aelita, its predictive potential and artistic merit within the tapestry of global cinema.","[{""name"": ""EKATERINA V.

10.1386/jptv_00063_1,JOURNAL OF POPULAR TELEVISION,1303 Drama Film and Television,A woman scientist in pursuit of truth: A rising trend of representation with Chernobyl,"Sky/HBO’s miniseries Chernobyl (2019) tells a human story behind the catastrophic disaster that had begun with an explosion at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Soviet Ukraine on 26 April 1986. Over the course of five one-hour episodes, Chernobyl dramatizes the incidents that paved the way to the massive explosion, such as the Cold War era, the dysfunctional Soviet bureaucracy and the power issues among the male political and scientific establishment. The highlight of the miniseries is female agency being the symbol of scientific approach, rational thought and common sense. This article analyses Chernobyl and the character of a Belarusian nuclear physicist named Ulyana Khomyuk (played by Emily Watson) by focusing on women’s representation on popular television in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. It also questions whether Chernobyl is one of the very few examples in popular culture of changing patterns of women’s representation in STEM.","[{""name"": ""Aslı Tunç"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000106717131 Istanbul Bilgi University""]}]","[""10.1177/107769900408100110"", ""10.1007/BF00291002"", ""10.1177/0963662508098580"", ""10.1088/0963-6625/2/3/002"", ""10.1088/0963-6625/6/3/005"", ""10.1177/0963662503123009"", ""10.1086/269251"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb02664.x"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb02916.x"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.1991.tb01394.x"", ""10.1057/9780230307049_10"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wrcn2.12"", ""10.1177/0163443711418272"", ""10.1177/0003122415596999"", ""10.1177/1075547005278610"", ""10.1057/9780230307049_10"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wrcn2.12"", ""10.1177/0963662503123006"", ""10.1177/107769909807500410"", ""10.1386/jptv_00063_1""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)]]"

Drawing on Levinas’s ethics of the ‘other’ and Salverson’s reflections on the ethics of documentary theatre, this article interrogates The Depraved Appetite of Tarrare the Freak as an example of documentary theatre and explores the unique opportunities and challenges presented when using puppetry to represent the historical ‘other’.","[{""name"": ""Tobi Poster-Su"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121711133 Queen Mary University of London and Wattle and Daub theatre company""]}]","[""10.1080/13528160701822742"", ""10.1353/tt.1997.0012"", ""10.1386/atr_00025_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

He is both overwhelmed by the mechanisms of the hierarchical abuse of power and a model of virtue for posterity. This article analyses Lazzaro’s symbolic potency within the wider frame of Alice Rohrwacher’s oeuvre by highlighting the similarities between the main character of Happy as Lazzaro and Marta and Gelsomina, the protagonists of Corpo celeste (Heavenly Body) (2011) and Le meraviglie (The Wonders) (2014), respectively: all question the world of adults through the lens of their adolescence. Unlike Marta and Gelsomina, however, Lazzaro is also regarded as a saint, whose invitation to indulge in ‘stupidity’ – or (holy) foolishness – and mysticism of reality goes unheard.","[{""name"": ""Roberto Interdonato"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419368948 University of Oxford""]}]","[""10.1080/02614340.2017.1332718"", ""10.1386/jicms_00026_1"", ""10.1080/17411548.2021.1921931"", ""10.3366/film.2021.0154"", ""10.1080/13545710701640707"", ""10.1080/02614340.2020.1764726"", ""10.1515/9783110603064-002"", ""10.1080/10509208.2017.1347866"", ""10.1179/026143412X13442661823539"", ""10.1386/jicms.5.3.305_1"", ""10.1386/jicms_00164_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

We elaborate on a need to refine scientific tools with creative means of art to find novel ways to explore dimensions of human–nature relations unobtainable with conventional scientific methods. Over the past few decades, arts-based research (ABR) methods have gained more popularity in academic research as they offer opportunities to approach aspects previously neglected in science, such as embodied and sensory experience. In this article, we describe the study accomplished in the form of site-specific performance at a nature conservation area combined with qualitative research inquiry focusing on participants’ ideas and experiences of nature. We reflect on the benefits of combining art and science when aiming at a better understanding of the range of variegated ideas and conceptualizations behind human behaviour, and at gaining knowledge of topics that are complex and contradictory.","[{""name"": ""Riikka Niemelä"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000120971371 University of Turku, Finland""]}, {""name"": ""Anna-Mari Laulumaa"", ""affiliation"": [""The Wellbeing Services County of Central Finland, Finland""]}, {""name"": ""Anna-Kaisa Tupala"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000110137965 University of Jyväskylä, Finland""]}, {""name"": ""Kaisa J.

As governments and health authorities around the world struggled to control the pandemic, key components of their efforts include the publicizing of their services, informing citizens of good hygiene practices, keeping the nation informed of the spread of the virus and generally keeping citizens in a positive and focused frame of mind. These efforts fall within the definition of health marketing which applies marketing principles and theories combined with health strategies to promote people’s health. These efforts also draw on both traditional and new digital channels, including online and social media, to carry across the health-marketing message to citizens. Zimbabwe is no different. The Ministry of Health and Child Care in Zimbabwe is the public authority responsible for healthcare in the country. This study reviews the three main digital channels used by the Ministry to communicate with Zimbabwean citizens, namely, their website, Facebook and Twitter. The review involves a longitudinal dissection of the communications shared across these three channels for the period from May to August 2020 and uses both content and thematic analysis to understand and critique the health communications being put out by the Ministry to its citizens. The review also takes into consideration the public comments on these communications to present a critical review of the effectiveness of these communications from a health-marketing perspective. The findings provide useful insight into the positive aspects and shortcomings of these communications and contribute to a conceptual framework for managing health-marketing communications in a time of crisis.","[{""name"": ""Shupikai Kembo"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000406103238 University of South Africa""]}, {""name"": ""Cornelius Bothma"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000406103238 University of South Africa""]}]","[""10.1177/1075547019846124"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12391"", ""10.15585/mmwr.su6503a10"", ""10.1080/10408363.2020.1783198"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2012.09.002"", ""10.1080/01900692.2015.1023447"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-809269-9.00004-9"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.05.031"", ""10.1177/1524500418813543"", ""10.1108/978-1-78756-269-120181016"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112712"", ""10.1080/10410236.2018.1449552"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-19869-9_12"", ""10.1093/cid/ciaa552"", ""10.1177/0169796X19826762"", ""10.1089/hs.2018.0020"", ""10.1177/1090198120935073"", ""10.1177/1524500419901254"", ""10.1177/1075547017731776"", ""10.1386/jams_00094_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Health', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

What has gone largely unremarked, however, is that there were two quite different prints of the 1938 film: one for British cinema audiences and a truncated and censored version for the American market. While Shaw saw, and publicly approved of, the British print, in all likelihood he was unaware that the widely seen American print, which ironically earned him an Academy Award for his screenplay, was a much inferior version of the film. This essay examines the changes foisted on Shaw's screenplay during the process of its translation to film and then compares the British print with its American counterpart, underlining the considerable differences between the two versions.","[{""name"": ""Derek John McGovern"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

In general, the Weird Wave had described a cohort of films beginning around 2009 in which familial dysfunction, violence, ineffectual communication, and corporeal “weirdness” allegorize Greek political, economic, and social crises. In a kind of temporal jumble, Tsangari's first film Fit (Greece, 1994) provides instructions for reading her later, supposedly Weird Wave films. The conceptual capaciousness of the term fit, as both a film title and a concept, refracts across Tsangari's films and career at large. This article exploits wordplay around fit as a technical standard of sound and image cohesion (how image and sound fit together), as a thematic narrative preoccupation regarding space, place, and belonging (fitting in), and as a categorizing metric (fit for inclusion). Reading diegetic and extradiegetic fit in Tsangari's film and television works, including Attenberg (Greece, 2010), The Capsule (Greece, 2012), the short 24 Frames per Century (Italy, 2013), Chevalier (Greece, 2015), and Trigonometry (BBC, 2020), reveals Tsangari's authorial signature and how Tsangari's films ambivalently benefit from “wave” marketing even as their reception bears out the costs of that uncomfortable fit. Paradoxically, Tsangari's auteur signature emerges in her struggle against category, especially Weird Wave and “women's cinema” labels. In diegetic and extradiegetic negotiations of belonging, Tsangari's auteurism emerges.","[{""name"": ""Eleni Palis"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.3138/md-65-1-1187,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,"A New Feminist Absurd?: Women's Protest, Fury, and Futility in Contemporary American Theatre","Absurdism has long been associated with existentialist white male writers like the ones Martin Esslin analysed in The Theatre of the Absurd (1961), which coined the term that came to define a lasting dramatic genre. More recently, however, several female playwrights have begun to reinvent this movement with an uncanny brand of feminist absurdism in their intimate domestic tragicomedies. In this essay, a close reading of Sheila Callaghan’s Women Laughing Alone with Salad (2015) serves as a touchstone for analysing performances of ludic feminist futility in plays by diverse writers including Ruby Rae Spiegel, Jackie Sibblies Drury, Alice Birch, and others. In their festive moments of anti-structural and non-linear oscillation between rage and glee, these plays mark the messy implosion of an outdated feminist political project, first anticipating and later reflecting the political tensions and crises evidenced in women’s voting, activism, and protest practices since the 2016 US presidential election. Often confining their characters within domestic or interior feminized spaces like kitchens, bedrooms, hidden supermarket aisles, or girls’ locker rooms, these playwrights celebrate failure and madness in the lives and labour of their female characters. By transforming historically feminized sites into dynamic spaces of resistance as well as spectacular failure, these performances of excess, from dieting to devouring, precarity to privilege, force audiences to confront cultural blind spots and failed or incomplete work toward efficacious feminist intersectionality. Furthermore, by bridging contemporary women’s anger research with whiteness and affect studies, this essay identifies a nascent trend in US theatre with a growing international profile that engages an updated absurdist rubric within a larger feminist praxis of political revolt.","[{""name"": ""Emily B.

10.3138/md-65-2-1201,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,A Mother's Touch: Ethics and Maternal Corporeality in Harold Pinter's Mountain Language,"Harold Pinter’s Mountain Language presents a national military’s violent attempt to outlaw an ethnic minority group’s language. The conflict between the military personnel and an injured Elderly Woman who waits to visit her imprisoned son orients this ban and its effects. But the common qualification that the work is one of Pinter’s “political plays” risks obfuscating its specific ethical dimension. By following the Elderly Woman and her son’s words and actions, it becomes possible to observe how Mountain Languages situates its ethical significance in the figure of the maternal body. This figure precipitates a form of corporeal cohabitation – a touch shared by two bodies that makes it impossible to distinguish completely where one body ends and the other begins – that not only troubles the distinction between self and other that often foregrounds theatre and performance studies’ “ethical turn” but also makes it necessary to reimagine the political itself. Such a matter bears on the play’s performance: the only sound that the Elderly Woman’s silent stillness emits during the play’s conclusion is that of the actor’s body who plays her. In this setting, the sound produced by the actor’s body touches the body of the spectator, inspiring them both to find the language to undo the “terrible trap” that the play depicts. Mountain Language makes it possible to consider how Pinter explores the ethical implications of theatrical performance.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/3207035"", ""10.1057/9781137297570"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5rdx7r"", ""10.3138/md.2012-0494"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226807867.001.0001"", ""10.5325/haropintrevi.2.1.0097"", ""10.2307/j.ctv16zjzb9"", ""10.1017/CCOL9780521886093.008"", ""10.1002/9780470751480.ch30"", ""10.1353/esp.1991.0060"", ""10.2307/2930162"", ""10.3138/md.17.4.423"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-36454-7"", ""10.3138/md.63.3.1076"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-09220-8"", ""10.5325/haropintrevi.3.1.0014"", ""10.3138/md.34.3.422""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Both films present cracks and horizons of becoming within the institutionalised Catholic Church, tracing possible paths of transformation for viewers aligning with and following the two main characters.

Ontologically, metamodernism is perceived as oscillating between the modern and the postmodern, whereby the tools of postmodernism (such as irony, sarcasm, parataxis, deconstruction, scepticism and nihilism) are employed to counter (but not obliterate) modernist naivety, aspiration and enthusiasm. This oscillation results in what the above authors have termed “informed naivety,” a phrase denoting a state of wilful pragmatic idealism that allows for the imagining of impossible possibilities. Vermeulen and van den Akker’s two key observations about the shift from postmodernism to metamodernism in contemporary art are discussed in this paper, namely the (re)appearance of sensibilities corresponding to those of Romanticism and the (re)emergence of utopian desires, in an attempt at a metamodernist analysis of the Netflix adaptation of theBridgertonbook series, aimed primarily at elucidating its popularity as one of the most watched programmes of the global Covid-19 pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Anamarija Šporčič"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Ljubljana ( Slovenia )""]}]","[""10.4324/9780203129876"", ""10.1215/9780822378419"", ""10.1515/9780804783217"", ""10.1515/9781782382027-003"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780199573400.001.0001"", ""10.1353/book515"", ""10.3402/jac.v2i0.5677"", ""10.1080/00393274.2014.981964""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

In spite of all the social criticism that the authors practiced with relish, it was already about the essential—the determination of a meaningful coexistence of synergetically connected art events. With the spread of video games, the question arises again and again: how to combine action and sound without falling prey to Mickey Mousing effect? As one of the youngest branches of music studies, ludomusicology describes a number of musical application scenarios, systematized according to effects and techniques. Their principles are comprehensible—under normal circumstances. With the Karmaflow—The Rock Opera Videogame, however, a project was started that leads to a new configuration between the media: in this game you play, in a manner of speaking, with or against the music itself. Because of its design, Karmaflow deserves to be considered on its own. Additionally, outside the subgroup of “music-based games”, heavy metal music is an exception among video games. The present essay illustrates the specific concept of the game which indeed can be placed in a range between video games and rock operas. The insights gained through (self-) observation are compared with the results of an exploratory survey. The survey was aimed at revealing the influence of sound on the gaming experience. The majority of respondents confirmed the connection between music and gameplay and the effect of musical characterization on some specific decisions. Test subjects, who, due to their preferences, belonged to the target group of game developers, judged differently than the other experiment participants.","[{""name"": ""LUISA JEDWILLAT"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""NATALIA NOWACK"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This modification consists of improvisational play combined with a pre-determined sequence of roles symbolic of common adverse childhood experiences of neglect or emotional or physical threat. While conducting this procedure, the therapist carefully observes the client’s responses within the play to note the presence of play disruptions (e.g. hesitation, shift of scene and/or emotional arousal). These shifts may arise from prior experiences that remain distressing to the client and might merit further exploration. A review of the literature concerning toxic stress and assessments of children (particularly those that are play-based), along with an illustration of the clinical assessment, are presented. Strategies for follow-up and early intervention possibilities are highlighted. Key ethical considerations of this procedure are also discussed.","[{""name"": ""David Read Johnson"", ""affiliation"": [""Post Traumatic Stress Center""]}, {""name"": ""Renée Pitre"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000092155771 Lesley University""]}, {""name"": ""Catherine Davis"", ""affiliation"": [""Post Traumatic Stress Center""]}]","[""10.1097/00004583-199601000-00011"", ""10.1037/a0017667"", ""10.1038/nrn2639"", ""10.1037/a0022667"", ""10.1037/a0024349"", ""10.1002/1097-0355(199524)16:4<271::AID-IMHJ2280160404>3.0.CO;2-B"", ""10.1386/dtr.2.2.167_1"", ""10.1017/S0954579401003029"", ""10.1521/bumc.2016.80.1.60""]",['Psychology'],['Clinical Psychology'],"[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

It is believed that horror is the feeling aroused when watching a horror film, and a sense of suspense and resolution is behind it. The present study explores how cultural, social, interactive, and cognitive contexts influence Turkish and American horror film naming. The present study aims to analyze Turkish and American horror film titles based on a socio-onomastic approach. So, 223 Turkish (1949-2021) and 2840 American (1898-2023) horror movie titles were investigated. The hypothesis was that Turkish horror film naming uses religious elements due to religious background. But according to the present study's findings, religious elements are also available in USA horror film naming. Yet, while making and naming their films, American horror film producers pay more attention to cultural events than Turkish filmmakers. On the other hand, the keywords used in naming Turkish and American horror films, regardless of their languages, were the same.","[{""name"": ""Ferdi Bozkurt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mandana Kolahdouz Mohammadi"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Computer Science']","['Communication', 'Cultural Studies', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1017/S0266464X21000142,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,A Conversation on Directing Opera,"Katie Mitchell has been directing opera since 1996, when she debuted on the operatic stage with Mozart and Da Ponte’s Don Giovanni at the Welsh National Opera. Since then, she has directed more than twenty-nine operas in major opera houses around the world. Mitchell here speaks of her directorial approach when working with the genre, addressing various aspects of interest for those who want a better grasp of the dynamics of opera-making in the twenty-first century. Ranging from the director’s imprint, or signature on the work they put on the stage, to the relationships forged with people running opera institutions, Mitchell reflects on her experiences when staging opera productions. She sheds light on some fundamental differences between theatre-making and opera production, including the issue of text – the libretto, the dramatic text, and the musical score – and the very basic fact that in opera a director is working with singers, that is, with musicians whose attitude and behaviour on stage is necessarily different from that of actors in the theatre. Running throughout the conversation is Mitchell’s commitment to ensure that young and contemporary audiences do not see opera as a museum artefact but as a living performative experience that resonates with the aesthetics and political imperatives of our contemporary world. She speaks of the uncompromising political imperatives that remain central to her work ethic, even if this means deserting a project before it starts, and reflects on her long-term working relations with opera institutions that are open to new and alternative approaches to opera-making strategies. Mitchell underlines her respect for the specific rules of an art form that, because of its collaborative nature, must allow more space for theatre-makers to venture within its complex performative paths if it wants to secure a place in the future. Mario Frendo is Senior Lecturer of Theatre and Performance and Head of the Department of Theatre Studies at the School of Performing Arts, University of Malta, where he is the director of CaP, a research group focusing on the links between culture and performance.","[{""name"": ""Katie Mitchell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mario Frendo"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

In these performances, we find feminist clowns engaged in an inquiry into gender identities, using their bodies as sites of political agency and inquisition.

This chapter considers adaptation as a form of memory work, paralleling adaptation’s textual layering with memory’s layering of experience. Adaptations can offer us experiential knowledge of the past—either fictional texts or a historical ‘truth’—or be antagonistic or self-reflexive about its formal remembrance. This chapter examines phenomenological approaches to the ‘tissue’ of memory and puts them in contact with two adaptations (one prestige, one arthouse), both concerned with the experience of marginalized bodies. In doing so, this chapter not only asks ‘what texts are remembered?’, or ‘who is remembered?’, but also questions ‘how are stories, identities, and lives remembered?’. In doing so, this chapter points to how an embodied approach to adaptation not only involves aesthetic appreciation but also ethical understanding.","[{""name"": ""Richard David Evan"", ""affiliation"": [""Queensland University of Technology""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

The refugee status of Koreans before and during the Korean War was a particularly ill-defined one; from a U.S. perspective, it was a label but not a legal status, and the consequent erasure of this particular aspect of militarism has had lasting effects on the U.S. imaginary. The 2022 premiere stages the Korean refugee experience onstage with attention to the dignity and creativity of the persons involved and without the explicit presence of the state. Bina’s Six Apples revises Cold War narratives, particularly countering the role of the Korean child or adoptee in narratives of U.S. saviorship and humanitarianism, and suggesting in keeping with contemporary concerns that we consider the child as an independent refugee and political actor. Furthermore, it suggests a means by which Korean (American) refugeetude is constructed transgenerationally. Feminist refugee epistemology importantly refocuses us on the creativity and storytelling that Bina hears and performs, a reflexive commentary on Suh’s work of historical reparation.","[{""name"": ""Heidi Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Cultural Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

B. Yeats's ‘The Tower’ has been thoroughly examined, much less attention has been paid to the female voice that inaudibly recites the poetic fragment in what constitutes the teleplay's chief intertextual gesture towards Yeats's poem. Aligning this oversight with the more pervasive disregard within Beckett Studies to the gendered specificity of Beckett's voices, this essay elaborates the absent presence of the female voice in the teleplay – crystallised in the image of W's silently moving lips – from the interlocking perspectives of intertextuality, technology, and spectatorship. It draws attention to Beckett's sustained preoccupation with the female voice during the composition process, as well as the intertextual and technological operations through which he orchestrates its paradoxical status. Even though as a speech-deprived female body functions as the locus of these overlapping processes, I argue that … but the clouds… ultimately subverts associations of the feminine with discursive inadequacy and bodily impairment; if anything, Beckett here attributes deficiency and incompletion to male subjectivity and the televisual medium.","[{""name"": ""Jivitesh Vashisht"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2930005"", ""10.1515/9780804767309"", ""10.2307/2930003"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7137.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199582907.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-10908-8"", ""10.1057/9781137020758_6"", ""10.1163/18757405-02801016"", ""10.4324/9780429481826"", ""10.1163/18757405-90000074"", ""10.1057/9780230801455_6"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-05103-8"", ""10.5040/9781474219280"", ""10.1515/9780748675692-023"", ""10.3366/E0309520709000302"", ""10.1057/9780230506060"", ""10.1163/9789042030794""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"

Reggae is historically a music of resistance, specifically resistance to oppression by White colonial power structures. That a British/French co-production uses reggae to reinforce an elided pan-Caribbean location featuring a White, male, British or Irish DI in charge of a local Black police force can be read as stereotypical. When added to a British/French series such as this, with what can be read as colonialist discourses, the readings can become problematic.

We argue that the tensions between the actors’ amateur status and their image as embodying a long-lost Biblical heritage were emblematic of the inherent contradictions within the hegemonic Ashkenazi Zionist discourse and the Orientalist perception of the role of Yemenite Jews in it. By exploring both Yemenite and Ashkenazi voices in and around the production, we analyse how the stage, the theatre hall and the written press all served as contested sites regarding the participation of non-European Jews in Hebrew theatre and culture. In the paper's conclusion, we demonstrate how Love as Strong as Death anticipated later debates in Israeli theatre about the place of Mizrahi Jews on stage and in the auditorium.","[{""name"": ""YAIR LIPSHITZ"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""NAPHTALY SHEM-TOV"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

One possible approach to the work is through Beckett’s reference to the idea of a ‘form of life’ in TFN6: ‘Or to know it’s life still, a form of life, ordained to end, as others ended and will end’ ( Beckett, 1995 , 125). The phrase holds out the possibility of a graspable difference between the two worlds abovementioned: in one of them life has form, in the other, it does not. Beckett’s source for the term, which goes back to Goethe, is Ernst Cassirer’s Kant’s Life and Thought. ‘Form of life’ can also be found sporadically in Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations and, more consistently in the work of Giorgio Agamben, to whose thought I appeal to at the end of this essay. But before that I consider in detail the way Texts for Nothing grapples with the question of how a form can be given to a life, and in particular the opposition between narrative and poesis that the work grapples with.","[{""name"": ""Conor Carville"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9780804786744"", ""10.1353/mfs.2004.0019"", ""10.1515/9781400841424"", ""10.1525/rep.2010.112.1.27"", ""10.1215/0041462X-2885194""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Each play was set within the secret war: at a radio station broadcasting black propaganda to Germany, at Bletchley Park, and at the heart of a secret mission to investigate dark doings in remotest Fenland. Similarly, each play dealt substantially with female characters and their troubled experience of wartime Britain. The plays provided a revisionist treatment of the mythology of the Second World War, painting a less cosy picture of the ‘People’s War’, with its supposed egalitarianism, shared sacrifice and vision of the different classes all supposedly ‘pulling together’. The article investigates the changing historiography of the secret war, a process in which the authorities attempted to manage the release of wartime secrets dealing with sabotage, resistance, deception and cryptography, and shows how the three dramas came into being through, and were influenced by, the opening up of the secret archive. Detailed attention to the production of the plays and their reception considers how the three historical dramas related to the Play for Today strand, traditionally celebrated for productions dealing with contemporary social and political issues.","[{""name"": ""Alan Burton"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tom May"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9781137311177"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780192129260.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2692326"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199283262.001.0001"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719066566.001.0001"", ""10.3138/md.28.2.189"", ""10.4324/9780203088326"", ""10.1177/030981687700100103"", ""10.4324/9781315606804""]","['Psychology', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Social Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This paper aims to show that examining Beckett's female subject formation allows us to map out not only our changed perception of self, but also the changing patterns of reception of his works over time in relation to the issue of female agency. While Beckett's male subjects in his early novels are often preoccupied with their own journey to find a solipsistic world in their quest for their authentic self, his drama concerns his characters’ affective experience, namely how they live to go on. This paper, thus, will show that what Beckett perceives as gender difference plays a crucial role in his portrayal of personhood that is closely interconnected with other people and external artefacts, as well as his theatricality as a mode of perception that brackets moments of action and our affective experience of time.","[{""name"": ""Rina Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/nar.0.0020"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8516.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230599536"", ""10.1017/9781108771108"", ""10.2307/3207893"", ""10.1515/9780823264698"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-12881-5"", ""10.1080/00497870500277880"", ""10.1016/j.jphysparis.2013.03.005"", ""10.1007/s11098-017-0935-0"", ""10.1007/s10912-015-9373-1"", ""10.1163/18757405-02901004"", ""10.1163/9789004357020_009"", ""10.1111/1467-9566.12453"", ""10.1057/9780230504622_6"", ""10.1177/1471301211409374"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6730.001.0001"", ""10.1163/18757405-024001019"", ""10.1163/18757405-02901016""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

This article will consider cinemas north of Inverness (Scotland's most northerly city), including those in Wick, Thurso and the islands of Orkney and Shetland. The talkies arrived late to all of the townships considered. Cinema audiences dwindled as silent films fell out of favour with local audiences well aware of the ubiquity of the talkies elsewhere in Britain. When sound finally did arrive, the return of audiences to local picture houses had a great impact on the small rural townships, forcing councils to deal with the ‘problem of the talkie queues’ and the ‘skailing of the picters’ (the audiences spilling out into the town after a film). Using a variety of archival sources – local newspapers, council reports, oral histories and diary entries – this article focuses on the various economic and social impacts resulting from the arrival of sound.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Neely"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780198805830.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315666051"", ""10.5040/9781911239949.ch-001"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474420341.003.0010"", ""10.5040/9780755699476"", ""10.3828/msmi.2018.10"", ""10.3828/msmi.2018.11"", ""10.3366/ijhac.2015.0147""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Urban Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

It concludes that, despite some anomalies, the ‘Billings verdict’ provides a broadly accurate overall summary of the ‘winners’ at the British box office over a period of a quarter of a century.","[{""name"": ""James Chapman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01439689200260081"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198159346.001.0001"", ""10.1080/713669742"", ""10.2307/2980312""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1017/S0266464X22000185,NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY,1303 Drama Film and Television,'The Best Thing I Ever Did on the Stage': Edward Gordon Craig and the Purcell Operatic Society,"Although lasting only two and a half years, Edward Gordon Craig’s engagement with the Purcell Operatic Society was his most consistent and productive period of work on the stage. This article re-examines this time during Craig’s life in order to ascertain why he saw it to be the zenith of his career. In particular, it analyzes his work with the amateur group to argue that it was foundational in the development of his approach to theatre-making and, further, helped him to introduce the entity of theatre director to Britain and what the role of such a person could be. By examining this material in relation to wider contextual factors, the article also shows how the group offered audiences an alternative to the dominant ‘star’ system of the early 1900s. The article thus indicates why Craig scholarship needs to place the Purcell Operatic Society at the centre of any of its discussions.

The series has been praised by many critics and scholars for its focus on reconstructed masculinity, healing and kindness, set against the backdrop of British football. These themes have contributed to the perception that the show’s success was due to it espousing uplifting and positive feelings that were needed escapism during this unprecedented global experience, which was greatly informed by apocalyptic discourse. This article thus examines Ted Lasso not as escapism or as utopianism, but as a regenerative apocalyptic narrative in which many of the traumas of the real world are confronted and transformed. Close-textual analysis focuses on the characters of Rebecca Welton and Ted Lasso’s intersecting narratives of trauma and reconstruction to reframe an understanding of the apocalypse away from the global to the personal. I use this analysis to demonstrate how the series uses an apocalyptic framework to offer a path through trauma towards a culture of regeneration. Rather than providing an escape, I argue that the series offered audiences the tools to negotiate the complexities of a COVID-world. The article consequently shows how Ted Lasso represents an alternative apocalyptic narrative that undermines nihilism in favour of ‘the Lasso way’.","[{""name"": ""Stacey Abbott"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121965555 Northumbria University""]}]","[""10.1177/0142064X211025464"", ""10.2307/3530703"", ""10.1525/fq.2021.75.1.35"", ""10.1080/13604813.2022.2081004""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Clinical Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

Why is it that this admittedly ‘creepy’ short ultimately leaves viewers and commenters ‘strangely comforted’? A rhetorical solution to this question is proposed: Hi Stranger’s creepy-yet-comforting appeal derives from the density with which it incorporates an array of rhetorical devices and affective registers – particularly the ‘rhetoric of sincerity’ indicative of a more general ‘metamodern’ sensibility. The intensified sincere rhetoric at work in Hi Stranger moreover has a decidedly reflexive dimension, for this online crowd-puller draws on many devices and registers popular in amateur online videos too: its offers of low-stake, anonymous intimacy and no-strings gifting; its ASMR and ‘cute’ appeal; and its self-professed care and appreciation for the viewer.","[{""name"": ""Johanet Kriel-de Klerk"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012284638X University of the Free State, Bloemfontein""]}, {""name"": ""Martin P.

Examination of the epistolarity of Evelina, and the dramatic use of dialogue Burney became known for, reveals breathlessness as the signifier of intense and instinctive moral discernment of the kind described by eighteenth-century philosophers such as Frances Hutcheson, complicating the view that the heroine of epistolary fiction more generally, and Evelina in particular, is purely passive. Instead, she emerges as actively involved in numerous scenarios that at once challenge her capacity for moral conduct and allow her to demonstrate her power to act.","[{""name"": ""Gillian Skinner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139680974""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Museology'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

Holy, Cross and Shechet take up Beckett's themes of gaze and petrification, particularly as seen in Beckett's works for women. For these contemporary artists, distilling the female form on paper, canvas, stone, or video is an act of creating a trace, inviting the viewer to participate, looking upon their women with empathy. Holy, whose drawings of antiquated women resemble those of Beckett's late plays, shares with Beckett the need for us to see these women. Cross, too, draws on the importance of seeing and remaining, inviting us to act our part in recognising that we are only a moment in ancient history. Her female forms, inspired by Footfalls, recede, and as they do so, we are tempted to follow. Drawn to Happy Days, Shechet asks that we look forward beginning conversations about the here, now, and the future. She asks that in the process, creatures like Winnie who cry out, are not forgotten. For this to happen, our gaze must go beyond objectifying Winnie.

Prince of Thieves is one among a prolific tradition of Robin Hood-themed digital games, which produce anew a legend that has thrived across intermedial networks of representation since the Middle Ages. The game represents a desire to transform popular medievalist narratives into play formats, but also the entwined and invested relationship between Hollywood and the game industry over the last half-century. This article will analyse how three core thematic elements of the game are inherently shifted in the adaptation process: the range of perspectives reduced by a first-person game, the modes of violence, and the role of familial relationships. The game is more than just a remediated version of the same story, as its adaptation process is a result of not only the medievalist tradition of Robin Hood and a connection to this film but also of the history of the action-adventure game genre and movie-adaptation games. This article will argue that the context of video game adaptation and genre conventions shape the way this text operates as a piece of franchise media, and that these constraints or choices in the game’s design in turn shape the production of vastly different historical meanings.","[{""name"": ""Tess Watterson"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Historical and Classical Studies, The University of Adelaide .

It examines Vallejo’s autofictional novel, Los caminos a Roma (The Roads to Rome) (1988) where he recounts his experience as a student at Rome’s Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in 1966, criticizes Italian neorealism and auteurism, and articulates his embryonic idea to create a film set during Colombia’s civil war. In his critique of Italian cinema, I argue that Vallejo embodies a certain hostility towards European film, its institutions and especially Italian neorealism that was percolating in the Latin America of the 1960s and 1970s. Exploring the historiography of Italy’s relationship with Latin American cinema, I remark on an emergent (and problematic) privileging of Italian neorealism as a prototype for New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) and consider how Vallejo’s filmmaking was shaped in opposition to Italian archetypes.","[{""name"": ""Brendan Hennessey"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121644508 Binghamton University""]}]","[""10.1080/10509200500536413"", ""10.1515/9783110279818-029"", ""10.14325/mississippi/9781617031229.003.0008"", ""10.5195/reviberoamer.2006.104"", ""10.1179/0161462212Z.00000000014"", ""10.1386/jicms_00128_1"", ""10.14325/mississippi/9781617031229.003.0010"", ""10.1179/007516308X344342"", ""10.1353/cj.2012.0014"", ""10.3828/bhs.2019.25""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Demography', 'Cultural Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

With the emergence of tensions between Portugal and India regarding the control of Portuguese India in 1947, and the beginning of the independence war in Angola in 1961, interest in filming Portugal’s eastern colonies arose from the need to sediment a Luso-orientalist discourse that ignored the broad range of local characteristics and the myriad differences that existed between Africa and Asia and, moreover, between various colonies within those regions.","[{""name"": ""Maria do Carmo Piçarra"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121511713 Universidade Nova de Lisboa""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

At the end of the 1940s, the Italian government signed bilateral agreements with Argentina and sponsored migratory practices – a dramatic solution for widespread unemployment – through an unprecedented promotional campaign.

The main argument of this article is that by analysing La Settimana Incom – and using some models proposed by Michail Bakhtin for this purpose – an ideological ‘mission’ behind the attention paid to emigration, a topic previously identified with traditional Italian values, can be discerned.","[{""name"": ""Massimiliano Gaudiosi"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000119427707 University Suor Orsola Benincasa""]}]","[""10.2307/464648"", ""10.1590/s0102-69922017.3201003"", ""10.1386/jicms_00125_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

The article juxtaposes anthropologist Józef Obrębski’s ethnographic writings about Polesia region (a part of ‘Kresy’ that was polonised in the most extreme manner) with Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad – a Polish-British author born and raised in ‘Kresy’, that during his time was subjugated by Russian Empire. The figure of Conrad, whose ambivalent relationship with colonialism was pointed out by many postcolonial scholars starting with Chinua Achebe, becomes a point of departure to think about what Maria Janion describes as ‘the paradoxical Polish postcolonial mentality’: the ambivalence of being a colonised coloniser.

Drawing on Bourgeois’s notebooks and diaries in her New York archive, in which Beckett makes fleeting appearances, this article presents a comparative reading of Bourgeois and Beckett, and identifies a significant number of affinities in their creative preoccupations and strategies, points of confluence that call into question assumptions by their respective critics that their creative practice is exceptional. A comparative reading with a female artist has the additional benefit of situating Beckett outside the masculinist heritage in which he has been inscribed, and brings into focus the gender bias that has been evident in both sets of scholarship. At once modernist and contemporary due to their longevity and the variety of their prolific output (over seventy years for Bourgeois and sixty for Beckett), Bourgeois and Beckett have both been successfully canonised: vital points of reference for artists and writers today, exhibitions and productions of their work also draw huge crowds. Their respective critics have hailed the work of Bourgeois and Beckett as remarkable and distinctive, setting them apart from their fellow artists and writers. They share a creative strategy, however: both dedicated themselves to a narrow range of themes and pursued these through the adoption of a diverse range of media, play with scale, and an unceasing experimentation with form.","[{""name"": ""Julie Bates"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7551/mitpress/1504.001.0001"", ""10.1353/esc.2014.0005"", ""10.1093/oxartj/kcx024"", ""10.3366/jobs.2004.13.2.3"", ""10.1086/292939"", ""10.1080/0950236X.2011.552292"", ""10.1353/cdr.2015.0037"", ""10.1080/02666286.2021.1941681""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The Studio was already free for the summer vacation after the tumultuous first show of Chekhov’s Three Sisters, opened only to a small number of guests a week before. Mikhail Kedrov had rehearsed the performance with the students for the preceding three years, and it was doomed to become the first public presentation of the so-called ‘method of physical actions’. Nevertheless, the presentation brought nothing more than doubts about the work done, and Stanislavsky felt compelled to call upon the pedagogues to understand what had happened. After briefly presenting his opinion of the work that had been shown, he started to elaborate on the technical and artistic achievements of the Studio. Stanislavsky began his talk in its stenographic transcript (File No. 21179 in the Stanislavsky Fund of the Moscow Art Theatre Museum Archives) with: ‘Everything now is lost. The technique and all the rest. I don’t see any foundation … any more. You should now start by the critique of the method I have been experimenting on.’ This article analyzes Stanislavsky’s documented talk, showing that he was not convinced that he had a new methodology, let alone one that synthesized his life-long theatre experiments. It seeks to present evidence that both the Physical Action and Active Analysis methodologies derived from Stanislavsky’s thought post mortem were developed only as two possible paths from his experiments, but were not the telos of his thought.","[{""name"": ""Diego Moschkovich"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"
10.1093/adaptation/apaa005,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,"'Endless Wonder' for Whom?: Adaptation, Transformation, and Magical Libraries","Abstract Books such as Polly Shulman’s The Grimm Legacy series, and made-for-television films and television series such as The Librarians and Warehouse 13 incorporate the idea of a library or repository where artefacts connected to various stories are stored that facilitates new adventures, not through retelling, but by using the space of the library as a contact point for people to encounter the artefacts, linking the past and the present. Though not adaptations per se, they challenge ideas of adaptation, transformation, and fidelity, and offer a new way to access different narratives. The library embedded in the book is a focal point for a societal nostalgia for libraries as potential spaces for knowledge and wonder, reflecting the push to protect libraries in contemporary society. The library artefacts become mechanisms for new, wondrous experiences, connected to and informed by knowledge from the past. The mechanism of the fantasy relies on a meta-construction of the library within the story as a portal, insofar as it relies on the recognizability of the stories embedded within the narrative as symbolically constructed ‘artefacts’. The library here is not just an archive, but a contact zone for wonder in an increasingly digitized age, and a departure point for a new fantastic journey.

The term is developed as a way of accounting for the complex mediatized co-presence between performer and audience in a representative example of this genre, Dead Centre's To Be a Machine (Version 1.0). As its theoretical framework, the article brings together the concept of ‘postdigital performance’ (Causey) with co-presence as a central element of liveness and spectatorship. It puts forth the hypothesis that To Be a Machine (Version 1.0) constructs a postdigital sense of co-presence that is characterized by a blurring of the lines between embodied and virtual spectatorship, temporal co-presence and real-time interaction with the remote audience, and an increased sense of emotional alignment with the remote audience in lieu of physical proximity.","[{""name"": ""TAMARA RADAK"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Computer Science'],"['Computer Science Applications', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

The festival’s goal is to demonstrate that movies can be captivating and immersive even if they are not large in file size, and encourages creators to experiment with low-energy technologies and techniques.

In the following decade, two activist films, Let the River Live (Greve ) and The Taking of Sámiland (Eriksen and Tannvik 1984), focused on the Alta conflict – protests against the construction of a power plant in Sámi territory – Indigenous rights and colonial processes. Inspired by discussions concerning documentary, activism and decolonialism, this article investigates how the films frame Sámi interests and challenge perceptions of the Norwegian state. Because both films are collaborations across ethnic boundaries, they also challenge the supposed insider/outsider perspective of Sámi and Indigenous film, offering decolonial narratives by centring on Indigenous voices and experiences, confronting the idea of Norway as homogenous and representing the state as a colonial oppressor. They represent a political turning point that has changed politics, film production and collective memory.","[{""name"": ""Stine Agnete Sand"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122595234 UiT The Arctic University of Norway""]}]","[""10.1177/000169938502800402"", ""10.18261/nmt.29.2.2"", ""10.2307/j.ctvcj2wqq.5"", ""10.1177/0267323116635831"", ""10.2979/FIL.2001.13.1.50"", ""10.1386/jsca_00064_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Philosophy', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

In the musical, Matilda’s love of reading and storytelling serves as a means of resistance and empowerment in the face of the oppressive forces of her parents and headmistress Miss Trunchbull, and she learns that the act of telling stories can help reshape reality. This article demonstrates that logotherapy, a branch of psychotherapy developed by Viktor Frankl, provides a valuable framework for analysing and understanding the themes of storytelling, identity formation and rebellion in the show. Logotherapy emphasizes the search for meaning as the key impetus in human life, and considers creativity and narrative determination as essential tools for realizing and claiming one’s purpose in society. This analysis of Matilda the Musical through the lens of Frankl’s logotherapy offers a unique perspective on the musical and opens up new insights into the importance of storytelling in the therapeutic process.","[{""name"": ""Allan Kilner-Johnson"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404074824 University of Surrey""]}]","[""10.1353/sew.2015.0062"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.48.4.0001"", ""10.1353/chq.0.0027"", ""10.1353/cea.2019.0007"", ""10.1007/s10583-017-9322-x"", ""10.1007/s10583-014-9233-z"", ""10.1177/002200940003500208"", ""10.2307/541853"", ""10.2307/468914""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

However, the choice of an Italian play with a Greek story for the performance of the first Greek tragedy in England at Gray’s Inn in 1566 remains a sidelined question. This article argues that one reason for their choice of Dolce’s play resides in his treatment of the Euripidean material in ways that attuned it to contemporary dramaturgical as well as cultural and political circumstances while scattering signposts throughout, suggesting belongingness to classical antiquity. One of these features was the female lament shared by the chorus and Antigone in the last act, which, while absent from Euripides, was a model that could be recognized as Euripidean and, more broadly, Greek.","[{""name"": ""Silvia Bigliazzi"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

It covers the period until 1927, when the establishment of the Istituti Italiani di Cultura (Italian Cultural Institutes) and the approval of a new regulatory framework for migration marked a new era for fascist soft-power ambitions. The article draws upon unpublished sources of the Historical Diplomatic Archive of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and offers a new perspective on the use of theatre and the performing arts as a tool for cultural diplomacy through the testimony of such flagship authors as Luigi Pirandello, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Alfredo Casella, and Pietro Mascagni.

In dealing with both the aesthetics and ethics of Beckett's failure, the article is informed by recent publications and events within the field ( Kenny ; Morin ; Maprayil; 2020 ). These interventions build upon a body of literature on Beckett ( McMullan, 1994 ; Calder, 2001 ; Anderton, 2016 ; Thomas, 2018) and culture ( Bersani and Dutoit, 1993 ; Ridout, 2006 ; Bailes, 2011 ; Halberstam, 2011 ). The article examines the phenomenon of failure within Beckettian production and wider ethical implications surrounding the (mis)appropriations of ‘failing better’. Having established the uses – and misuses – of this phrase, the article proceeds in three interlinked parts: a) aesthetic failure in Beckett's creative practice through to his legacy in experimental theatre and popular culture; b) performance more broadly, including intersections with disability culture and queer studies; and c) performative interventions in public discourse, from Brexit in Europe to the 2016 US Presidential Election as well as social movements such as Black Lives Matter.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan Heron"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3366/jobs.2015.0140"", ""10.5040/9781474234566"", ""10.4324/9780203846179"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-47110-1"", ""10.1093/eic/XLV.1.84"", ""10.7135/UPO9780857285805"", ""10.1215/9780822394358"", ""10.1080/13569783.2017.1293513"", ""10.3366/jobs.2014.0087"", ""10.3366/jobs.2018.0245"", ""10.1017/9781108767750"", ""10.3366/jobs.2018.0234"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521413664.011"", ""10.1080/10486801.2017.1405393"", ""10.1017/9781108284011"", ""10.3366/jobs.2014.0088"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511617669"", ""10.1162/dram_e_00893"", ""10.1017/9781108559331.010"", ""10.1162/105420402320980569""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

What stood out in this production was the defined acoustic presence of the matchseller, Barnabas. The original recording, aired almost forty years earlier by the BBC Third Programme, on 29 July 1959, was much more ambivalent in this regard, sparking decades of scholarly debate as to whether the old man is really there. This article analyzes that remarkable shift in sonic portrayal through the context in which A Slight Ache was originally produced, its later reincarnations for stage and screen, as well as the changing academic climate in which it has been critically received. As a result, A Slight Ache must be regarded as a transmedial play, crucial to Pinter’s career development, and not as a quintessentially radiophonic event.","[{""name"": ""Pim Verhulst"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford and University of Antwerp""]}]","[""10.1080/01439685.2020.1778314"", ""10.3138/md-65-2-1218"", ""10.1080/01439685.2020.1778313"", ""10.1080/01439685.2020.1778322"", ""10.3138/md.17.4.403"", ""10.3138/md.0744"", ""10.5325/haropintrevi.5.2021.0070""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Through an Indigenization and transformation of the Christmas nativity as virtual performance, Sirang Theatre Ensemble reimagined the folk theatre form Pastores as a transnational project to articulate climate justice after Super Typhoon Yolanda and Super Typhoon Odette. In this article, we orbit our discussion of sustainability by answering questions around Philippine-Canadian transnational theatre collaboration and decolonization of foreign aid. To foreground a discourse of sustainability, we looked at Waray collectivist epistemology and critical analysis of the role of translation in reviving intangible cultural heritage. The online show Adoración de los Pastores: Transnational Solidarity for Climate Justice in the Performance of Waray Pastores conceptualizes transnational theatre creation as a performance of sustainability. Inserted in between scenes and after the performance of Adoración de los Pastores were curated testimonies, commentaries, and a forum participated in by diasporic Filipino Canadians, Filipino theatre artists, and Canadian-based theatre artists, climate justice advocates, a social scientist, a priest, and students, as well as a recorded video of the former Vice President of the Republic of the Philippines on the impact of Super Typhoon Odette on local community members in Leyte Province. Staging disaster stories by local artists who directly experience the brunt of climate crises and the mobilization of diasporic transnational collaboration expands the practice of sustainable disaster response and recovery beyond the international foreign aid assistance model and paradigm.","[{""name"": ""Dennis Gupa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jose Lianza"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amado Babon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kenneth Alvin Cinco"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Allen Baylosis"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/pubmed/fdab268"", ""10.1080/14672715.2017.1339453"", ""10.13185/KK2020.03507""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Grandmont’s translation of Pygmalion highlights translation as creative and productive, rather than derivative and secondary, work because it reconstructs and reterritorializes, rather than mimics, a Shavian Montreal.

In relocating each play from its prescribed domestic interior, both productions explicitly drew on and incorporated the conventions of different media, specifically radio and film, in markedly different ways. Rather than transposing the country home of Pinter’s original radio play onto the stage in an analogous setting, Lloyd’s Slight Ache featured two performers appearing in a radio studio to voice their characters, thereby complicating the identities and motivations of the play’s characters by evoking a place of work, not a place of domestic retreat. In Leopold’s starkly minimalist Homecoming, video projections and visualizations of the human body as a kind of digital automaton replaced the trappings of domesticity, inviting audiences to focus instead on the live and mediatized bodies of the characters. Through their different means of representation, these productions demonstrate two different approaches to decentring domestic space in Pinter’s early plays via distinct intermedial strategies. In doing so, they offer a renewed focus on the embodied presence of the actors, thereby inviting new insights into how Pinter’s early characters can transcend the confines of their interior spaces on stage and underscoring the writer’s own inherently intermedial praxis.","[{""name"": ""Catriona Fallow"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3138/9781442675629"", ""10.1080/01439685.2020.1778314"", ""10.1163/9789401210089"", ""10.5325/haropintrevi.4.1.0052"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139939607"", ""10.5325/haropintrevi.2.1.0022"", ""10.1080/01439685.2020.1778322"", ""10.1163/18757405-03201006"", ""10.3138/md.17.4.403"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521651239.013"", ""10.1353/mlr.2019.0018"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511617669"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-09220-8"", ""10.3138/md.0744"", ""10.5325/haropintrevi.5.2021.0070""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

J.B. Priestley’s An Inspector Calls (1944) is a popular play often considered “political” by reviewers, yet it proposes no fundamental change to the political landscape its seeks to critique. Brecht’s Lehrstück, which dissolves the boundary between actor and spectator, offers a different mode of performance that actively confronts performers with the implications of their fictional counterparts and invites reflection on how the problems presented might be addressed. The article identifies the political shortcomings of Priestley’s play and introduces Brechtian categories into the analysis and performance of the play before radicalizing these by transforming An Inspector Calls into a Lehrstück. The process the play undergoes signals the liveliness and durability of this dramaturgical form and offers an example of how Brecht can remain productive in a contemporary theatre context.","[{""name"": ""David Barnett"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5040/9781472558640"", ""10.1215/01610775-25-2-9"", ""10.1353/phl.1999.0014"", ""10.4324/9780203932629"", ""10.1163/9789004456679"", ""10.5040/9781350172814"", ""10.1353/mon.2013.0022"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521857090.009"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-01561-7"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521857090.007"", ""10.1353/tt.2015.0004"", ""10.3138/MD.0842"", ""10.1163/9789401211819"", ""10.1007/978-3-476-03072-6"", ""10.1162/105420499760263570""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

And yet, while there is much excellent material available that addresses his enigmatic earlier dramas, and his middle period as an author of “political” plays, there is far less analysis of the work he produced in his later years. This article investigates his last screenplay, an adaptation of a 1970s British psychological thriller. This article demonstrates how Sleuth is a projection, and a violent expression, of Tindle's and Wyke's patriarchal urges to establish and maintain social, sexual, and masculine power over “Maggie,” and one another. The article explores and explicates how, through the application of a variety of complex verbal and nonverbal stratagems, the men seek to maintain and strengthen their psychological advantage. The work also addresses a range of other issues including epistemology, performance, and identity.

Through the memoir, which I contend is an apologia pro vita sua, a justification for the author’s own life and work, Veit-Wild seeks to dispel long-standing accusations that she has benefitted from Dambudzo Marechera and his legacy. As she depicts herself as a magnanimous activist and scholar, Veit-Wild reverses the script by portraying Marechera as a “galling scoundrel” who “depended on others to sustain him.” In the process, far from offering an authoritative portrait of Marechera that we can trust, the memoir dehumanises the writer. Suggesting that Veit-Wild’s relationship with Marechera was motivated more by racialised objectification than love and respect, the text reproduces a white saviour narrative that reinscribes racist tropes of representation. While it also engages other works by Veit-Wild, this article delves into They Called You Dambudzo’s (un)critical reception, its unsettling portrayal of Marechera as a spoilt, ungrateful, and mentally ill writer who “had a way of taking for granted whatever was done for him,” Veit-Wild’s self-representation as both Marechera’s victim and saviour, her misappropriation of Marechera’s thought to enforce colourblindness, and the vexed colonial politics of speaking for others that the memoir lays bare.","[{""name"": ""Marzia Milazzo"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Johannesburg Johannesburg South Africa""]}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/S0040557420000460,THEATRE SURVEY,1303 Drama Film and Television,"""The Farcical Tragedies of King Richard III"": The Nineteenth-Century Burlesques","Unlike other Shakespearean tragedies,King Richard IIIwas never turned into a comedy through the insertion of a happy ending. It did, however, undergo a transformation of dramatic genre, as the numerousRichard IIIburlesques and travesties produced in the nineteenth century plainly show. Eight burlesques (or nine, including a pantomime) were written for and/or performed on the London stage alone. This essay looks at three of these plays, produced at three distinct stages in the history of burlesque's rapid rise and decline: 1823, 1844, and 1868. In focusing on these productions, I demonstrate how Shakespeare burlesques, paradoxically, enhanced rather than endangered the playwright's iconic status.King Richard IIIis a perfect case study because of its peculiar stage history. As Richard Schoch has argued, the burlesque purported to be “an act of theatrical reform which aggressively compensated for the deficiencies of other people'sproductions. . . . [It] claimed to perform not Shakespeare's debasement, but the ironic restoration of his compromised authority.” But this view of the burlesques’ importance is incomplete. Building on Schoch's work, I illustrate how theKing Richard IIIburlesques not only parodied deficient theatricalproductionsbut also called into question dramaticadaptationsof Shakespeare's plays. In so doing, these burlesques paradoxicallyrelegitimizedShakespeare.","[{""name"": ""Nicoletta Caputo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4159/9780674040137"", ""10.3726/b14205""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Anthropology', 'Museology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

It argues that these aesthetics are integral to the movement’s heterogeneous but radical politics, even as the filmmakers express them through widely different means. The article focuses primarily on three films that span the final decade in which Rebellion filmmakers were active at UCLA: Barbara McCullough’s Water Ritual #1: An Urban Rite of Purification (1979), Alile Sharon Larkin’s A Different Image (1982), and Zeinabu irene Davis’s Cycles (1989). Each of these films’ renderings of Afrocentric feminist aesthetics—through attention to African oral and mythical traditions, African and Pan-African-inflected mise-en-scène, rich col-oration and film stock, and play with nonlinear, nonteleological time—register at once the sedimented condition of patriarchal anti-Blackness in the United States and Black feminists’ ongoing projects of freedom that perdure within and despite that condition. In many ways, such representations anticipate contemporary Black feminist grapplings with recent Black studies scholarship that orbit around Afro-pessimist theories of Black ontology and social death. Through their expressions of Afrocentric feminist forms of communal, caring, and creative living, the films represent a form of Black social life that expresses value systems and ways of being that are incompatible with social death, even when they are inevitably moored within its ontological structure.","[{""name"": ""Jamie Ann Rogers"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Operating not only as a parody of Hawks’s western films and Hong Kong martial arts cinema, BTiLC uses the pre-existing structure present in Hawk’s comedies to produce a film that is able to convincingly portray Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) as both the hero of the film and the incompetent comic relief; thus positioning its Asian American characters as its functional heroes, without this inversion ever seeming condescending or mean-spirited. This framing of the film consequently highlights the differences between BTiLC’s use of genre and Reagan era masculine heroism and the more reactionary elements of their contemporaries.","[{""name"": ""Nikolas Matovinovic"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Media Film and Journalism, Monash University""]}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

This article offers a different approach, reading his play The Reprobate (1895) within its theatrical context and emphasizing its relations with the genre of “Ibsen parodies” – in particular, those produced by authors such as J.M. Barrie and Robert Williams Buchanan. Attention to the play’s humorous treatment of heredity – in the midst of a theatrical scene engaging with the paradigm of degeneration – reveals James as surprisingly in step with dramatic developments informed by contemporary evolutionary paradigms, ideas about gender, and comedic genres. The Reprobate’s clear relationship to works by Ibsen, Barrie, and others – as well as the intellectual framework it shares with plays by George Bernard Shaw – suggests the need to reconsider the entrenched view of James’s output in this period, especially as a playwright.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Ibrahim Abdalla"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3138/md.45.1.1"", ""10.5962/bhl.title.3734"", ""10.1037/h0067686"", ""10.1515/9781400840090"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511763311.001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139523981"", ""10.3366/E2041102209000057"", ""10.1017/S0307883303001044"", ""10.1057/9780230621275""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Using references to class conflict and Britain’s colonial past, the article invites discussion on the trio’s relationships. By unpacking Davies’s motives and encounters with the two brothers, we can see how Davies’s influence impacted them during his stay and later in his eviction from the house. Pinter can bring to the fore how Aston and Mick, while defending their own identities, are subconsciously changed forever because of their encounters with strangers.","[{""name"": ""Farah Ali"", ""affiliation"": [""Lahore University (Pakistan) of Management Sciences""]}]","[""10.2307/778467"", ""10.2979/jmodelite.38.4.147"", ""10.1086/448592"", ""10.1353/ncr.0.0082"", ""10.5325/critphilrace.4.1.0056"", ""10.4000/osb.433"", ""10.3366/olr.1987.002"", ""10.2307/3207891"", ""10.1007/s11466-006-0009-4""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

CONAN DOYLE ABOUT SHERLOCK HOLMES","The article covers the problem of the protagonist’s image portrayal in modern cinema on the example of the three most recent film adaptations based on works by Conan Doyle. The relevance of this scientific issue is explained by the fact that the peculiarities of representing the character in modern cinema partly reflect the state of society itself, its social problems, phobias and neuroses. Cinematography, like no other type of contemporary art, has broad opportunities to embody almost any character in three-dimensional reality, which imposes a certain social responsibility for the results of the main characters’ portrayal. The appeal to the archetypal images of world literature implies not only the openness of improvisation, but also the preservation of the character’s social function. The article analyzes the representation of one of such archetypal images of world significance—Sherlock Holmes. The research methodology is based on a systematic approach and general scientific methods, and also includes special methods: content analysis of scientific literature related to the topic; the method of sociological survey (questionnaire survey), the method of statistical analysis. The empirical study, the results of which are presented in this article, is based on three screen adaptations of the Sherlock Holmes stories, produced in the 2000s in Great Britain, Russia and the United States. The study involved 150 respondents, whose answers were converted from a qualitative to a quantitative format to analyze the specifics of the representation of the main character (the protagonist). The authors of the article came to the following conclusions: in modern film adaptations the protagonist is portrayed not as a genius of the scientific method of thinking, but as a sociopath who is unable to interact with society without an intermediary (a companion character). Moreover, modern screen adaptations violate the archetypal image itself due to improvisations with the static characteristics of the character, which leads to a negative perception of such a character by the audience. The very strengthening of sociopathic features of the protagonist’s character, shifting the emphasis from the idea of higher justice, from eternal values to private motives, lead to a certain simplification of the character, and also serve as an indicator of the state of society itself. The theoretical significance of the research is determined by the fact that this article offers original criteria developed by the authors to analyze the representation of the character. The practical significance of the article is backed by the conclusions and results of the study, which can be used for further work to identify the impact of characters’ representations on shaping value orientations in modern society.","[{""name"": ""BELLA A.

Defining shock as a “structure of feeling” (Raymond Williams) that was pursued in especially teachable ways by the modernist “play of ideas,” this essay shares a set of pedagogical strategies for helping students to feel this shock while also reflecting on the political implications of an art committed to shock. Among these teaching strategies are two attempts to set this “terrible art” (G. B. Shaw) in new, revealing contexts: (1) comparing the modernist theater to non-theatrical practices that attach ideas to structures of feeling besides shock, and (2) pairing modernist plays that “shock” their audience in pursuit of a feminist politics with contemporary plays that “destroy the audience” (Young Jean Lee) in pursuit of an anti-racist politics. The result is not to lionize shock as a universal ideal, but to explore it as a tactic—useful in some settings, harmful in others; always distributing its benefits and its costs unevenly.","[{""name"": ""Christopher A.

10.3138/md-65-4-1182,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,"""A Positive Statement of a Negative Thing"": Nietzschean Eternal Recurrence as Dramatic Form in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot","Much has been written in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries about the pessimistic tenor of Samuel Beckett’s middle-period plays. With specific reference to Waiting for Godot, however, this essay draws a distinction between the pessimistic appearance of the content that partially constitutes this text and the nature of the formal medium through which it is realized. In short, I argue that there is a critical disjunction between what this play says and what this play does. Conceptually speaking, this essay is primarily concerned with Beckett’s textual engagement with the theory of eternal recurrence, that is, the idea that all occurrences have happened innumerable times before, and will happen again, and again, in an infinitely recurring cycle. Focusing on how Waiting for Godot developed, both in translation and as a performance piece under the direction of its author, I demonstrate that Beckett’s metatheatrical dramatization of eternal recurrence explores this theory’s capacity to function as an ethical imperative in the morally nihilistic atmosphere of post-Holocaust Europe. In doing so, Beckett’s play implicates the viewer in a dramatization that is aligned with the axiological iteration of eternal recurrence that modern and contemporary scholars associate with Friedrich Nietzsche. Indeed, it is in this sense that Waiting for Godot is, as Beckett himself puts it, “a positive statement of a negative thing.”","[{""name"": ""Matthew Fogarty"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1207953"", ""10.2307/488027"", ""10.5040/9781474234566"", ""10.3138/md.50.2.138"", ""10.1057/9780230118829"", ""10.1080/09670880220148366"", ""10.1007/BF01513949"", ""10.5040/9781350106864"", ""10.3366/jobs.2012.0047"", ""10.3200/EXPL.65.3.167-171"", ""10.1515/9780748675692-025"", ""10.3366/jobs.2004.13.2.7"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226433790.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511554216"", ""10.2307/j.ctv47wbg8"", ""10.2307/29735343"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198822547.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108284011"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812057"", ""10.4159/9780674042643"", ""10.1163/9789047411383"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-75535-9"", ""10.3366/jobs.2000.9.2.3"", ""10.1057/9780230506060""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Such revivals can make visible ecological or environmental features that might have gone unnoticed in the past, but which can inspire agency and instil knowledge in the present. This idea is explored in relation to an Irish production of Caryl Churchill’s Far Away (2000), which was staged on an uninhabited island off the South Coast of Ireland in 2017 by Corcadorca Theatre Company. This production can be seen as offering a practical illustration of many of the theoretical ideas associated with theatre ecologies, especially for how Corcadorca blurred distinctions between audience and performers, indoors and outdoors, performance and spectatorship, past and present, and much more. This production should thus be seen as a case study that is worthy of analysis in its own right but which also allows for the identification of viable practices for the staging of theatrical revivals more generally.","[{""name"": ""Patrick Lonergan"", ""affiliation"": [""National University of Ireland , Galway Ireland""]}]","[""10.1080/14688417.2019.1706609"", ""10.1515/jcde-2020-0003"", ""10.3138/md.0521"", ""10.5040/9781472511072.0006"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226733050.001.0001"", ""10.1515/jcde-2015-0002"", ""10.5040/9781784602420.00000003"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780198792987.001.0001"", ""10.1353/mdr.2007.0038"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226323176.001.0001"", ""10.1215/22011919-3615934"", ""10.1080/13528165.2020.1752575"", ""10.4324/9781003028888"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11638.001.0001"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674061194"", ""10.1017/CCOL9780521493222.006"", ""10.1515/jcde-2018-0009"", ""10.3998/mpub.13741"", ""10.1080/1048680031000077816"", ""10.1515/jcde-2020-0024"", ""10.5749/9781452962054""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

By analyzing how characters use language—most notably prototypicality threats—to establish dominant gendered behaviors, the article outlines how they can control the narrative of not just their own lives but the gender hierarchy within their relationships. The article also references Jamie Lloyd’s 2019 production, one that directly questions gender roles in the play and explores the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of both the male and female characters. This analysis adds further layers to how interpretations of the text can allow for understandings of the power dynamics within the play and how they relate to the normative gendered behaviors in performance as well as the text.","[{""name"": ""Alix Burbridge"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Reading""]}]","[""10.1111/josi.12283"", ""10.1177/1097184X18805555"", ""10.2307/3194315""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Gender Studies', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"
10.1017/S0040557420000265,THEATRE SURVEY,1303 Drama Film and Television,"""A Christy Minstrel, a Harlequin, or an Ancient Persian""?: Opera, Hindustani Classical Music, and the Origins of the Popular South Asian ""Musical""","The story of South Asian colonial modernity and music offers up a multidirectional and polymorphous conceptual terrain featuring, among many agents, Hindustani royalty, touring minstrel and burlesque troupes, Jesuit missionaries and orientalists, and not least, social reformists. Nevertheless, scholarship on the history of Hindustani music consistently traces its development through classicization against the rise of Hindu nationalism while overlooking other palpable clues in the colonial past. This article argues for a substantial reevaluation of colonial South Asian music by positing an alternative and hitherto invisible auditory stimulus in colonial Asia's aural landscape: opera. Janaki Bakhle contends that “as a musical form, opera put down even fewer roots than did orchestral, instrumental Western classical music,” even though she subsequently states that “Western orchestration did become part of modern ceremonial activities, and it moved into film music even as it was played by ersatz marching bands.” Bakhle further argues that Hindustani music underwent processes of sanitization and systematization within a Hindu nation-making project, a view that has been complicated by historians such as Tejaswini Niranjana. Niranjana describes how scholarship that focuses exclusively on the codification or nationalization of Hindustani music through the interpellation of a Hindu public neglects “sedimented forms of musical persistence.” Not dissimilarly, Richard David Williams highlights how the singular emphasis on the movement of Hindustani music reform risks reducing the heterogeneous and complex musicological traditions in the colonial period to the output of a single, monolithic, middle-class “new elite.” Previous scholarship, he argues, concentrates on “one player in a larger ‘economy’ of musical consumption.” Following these calls for more textured perspectives on South Asian musical cultures, I suggest a somewhat heretical thesis: that opera functioned as a common mediating stimulus for both the colonial reinscription of Hindustani music as classical as well as the emergence of popular pan-Asian musical genres such as “Bollywood” music.","[{""name"": ""Rashna Darius Nicholson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/670165"", ""10.1080/09502386.2017.1328518"", ""10.7765/9781784996987"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195166101.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ml/gcw071"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1360.2009.01051.x"", ""10.1080/01419870701356064"", ""10.1177/1748372717735819"", ""10.1017/S1356186317000311"", ""10.1080/1366616042000236914"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wq5jh"", ""10.1017/S0022463415000351"", ""10.1080/00856400008723413"", ""10.1080/1479027042000327165""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Central to these questions is the role and responsibility of corporations, situated within an eminently recognizable, but not particularly effective, law and order. iZombie accurately portrays the continued production of a dangerous product within a legal framework that protects corporations and investors, rather than customers. Given the dependence of zombies on access to brains, the series sheds light on the responsibility of consumers, legal authorities and broader society in perpetuating harms. In light of our increasing dependence upon corporations and the systemic harms that they cause, what kinds of justice are available?

Nowadays, the Zombie in the cinema are beyond the figure of a horror. As a matter of fact, many zombie-themed movies are presented as allegories of apocalypse or as outbreak-themed movies. What is the meaning of the zombies which are the subject of outbreak films? What cultural codes do zombies represent in outbreak-themed films? What does the changes in different adaptations of this myth mean in outbreak-themed movies? Zombies in epidemic films can be likened to slaves that are reprogrammed after a resurrection process.

It investigated what it means to be African and the impact of multiple identities and forms of belonging within diasporic communities. Emphasis was on how they experience the diaspora as liminal spaces and subsequently negotiate relationships with other Africans in indeterminate diasporic spaces to construct, redefine, negotiate and even contest identities. Using snowballing and purposive sampling, the study analysed first-hand accounts and interviews informed by personal histories and lived experiences of (1) what they know about Africa; (2) their sense of belonging to Africa; (3) how Africa is represented in the media and (4) their views/attitudes on markers of African identity. Findings indicate that young Africans in the diaspora have a strong sense of belonging to Africa and are actively engaged with different forms of African media such as music and films.","[{""name"": ""L.

By investigating Chan’s screen persona, which has roots in Hong Kong/Chinese martial arts cinema, I focus on how the film derives and builds upon Chan’s transnational status as a cinema icon to critically engage with the conventional Yellow Peril narrative.","[{""name"": ""Kin-Yan Szeto"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Theatre and Dance, Appalachian State University""]}]","[""10.1515/9780520971103-003"", ""10.2307/3207893"", ""10.3167/IJSQ.2016.060102"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-23829-3_2"", ""10.5040/9781838710934"", ""10.4324/9780203482810"", ""10.1177/1468796805052113"", ""10.1007/s10308-003-0033-0"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199331000.001.0001"", ""10.24162/EI2009-2341"", ""10.1515/9780824861865"", ""10.1023/A:1022931309651"", ""10.1080/00131910802684813"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-5595-9_7"", ""10.1002/9781444317916.ch14"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748632855.001.0001"", ""10.1086/229155""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1017/S0040557423000303,THEATRE SURVEY,1303 Drama Film and Television,Yeats's Photographs and the World Theatre of Images,"W. B. Yeats's dramatic career was transformed in the 1910s through a series of collaborations in London. In an essay from the period, “Certain Noble Plays of Japan,” he writes: “I have invented a form of drama, distinguished, indirect and symbolic.” This form, like many other modernist inventions, is better understood as something else, in this case the alchemy of his earlier work, some eclectic influences, and the contributions of his American, English, French, and Japanese collaborators. Together, this group of artists drew on Irish mythology, the occult, the continental avant-garde, and—as often has been stressed—Japanese noh. Originally, the “Certain Noble Plays” essay was published as an introduction to a related noh project, Ezra Pound's liberal completion of Ernest Fenollosa and Hirata Kiichi's incomplete translations. There have been at least four book-length studies on the relationship between Yeats and noh, as well as many theses and articles. It remains an exemplum of transnational modernist theatre.","[{""name"": ""Kevin Riordan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.3138/md.63.4.1085,MODERN DRAMA,1303 Drama Film and Television,Yeats's Doll and Donkey: Alienating the Upanishads in The Herne's Egg,"The Herne’s Egg, like Yeats’s other late plays, is a great challenge for readers. In addition to putting forward an esoteric philosophy that evades coherent interpretation, the play is deliberately anti-heroic, grotesque, and sexually offensive. Yeats’s remark that the play is Purohit Swami’s “philosophy in a fable” has guided critics toward the Upanishads for clues. This essay questions longstanding assumptions about the Indian influence on the play, examining Yeats’s appropriation of the Upanishadic concept of the Self for his own vision of Unity of Being. Interpretations of the play that foreground the influence of the Sanskrit texts on Yeats’s dramaturgy often overlook the play’s form and genre. This essay aims to shed new light on the play by drawing attention to its style, which fuses several modernist aesthetics in a form of experimental farce. I argue that gaiety is Yeats’s way of dealing with the futility resulting from his determinist view of the universe. Yeats’s farcical style creates quasi-Brechtian alienation effects in The Herne’s Egg, sublimating existential dread to tragic joy.","[{""name"": ""Yeeyon Im"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5949/liverpool/9780983533924.001.0001"", ""10.1163/9789004485044"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-06838-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-17367-9"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674864726"", ""10.1086/389186"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-00618-2""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Films that draw on autobiographical experiences are a way of working through and constructing narratives of the self. How can memory work be applied to the writing and filmmaking process? Can memory work, with its focus on personal and embodied experience, lead us to a more truthful account of our individual histories and ourselves? In addressing these questions, I draw on sociological and memory studies into autobiographical memory in my examination of the screenwriting work of Australian actor/writer Daniel Monks. Monks’ films Marrow (2015) and Pulse (2017) are adapted and developed from the author’s personal memories and experiences. Identifying as disabled and queer, Monks’ work straddles the fact-fiction divide, enabling the social and personal to dynamically interact, producing drama narratives where the body is the primary site for retelling and sharing with an audience his need to be seen. My study includes original drafts of screenplays, produced films and interviews with Monks on his writing and development processes. Demonstrating how Monks uses and refigures his body within a cinematic landscape, I aim to promote discussion on how individual memories function as dynamic and interconnected sources for the screenwriter/filmmaker.","[{""name"": ""Kerreen Ely-Harper"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000403754078 Curtin University""]}]","[""10.1086/495287"", ""10.1098/rstb.2001.0940"", ""10.1177/107780040100700608"", ""10.1386/josc_00050_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Known as the New American Cinema Expositions, these became instrumental in the conceptualization of the NAC and would lay foundations for emerging historiographies of experimental film. Applying historian Allan Megill’s three concepts of historiography—affirmative, critical, and didactic—we argue that most of experimental film history has been either affirmative or didactic. Hence, based on extensive archival research, this article sets out to accomplish a critical historiography. We discuss the organization, presentation, development, and reception of three stops of the NAC expositions—the Festival dei Due Mondi (Festival of Two Worlds) in Spoleto, Italy (1961), Moderna Museet in Stockholm (1964), and the Freunde der Deutschen Kinemathek in West Berlin (1967). Our analysis highlights the discrepancies and differences among the shows and permits us to question and problematize the narrative and historiography of the NAC.","[{""name"": ""Miguel Fernández Labayen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""John Sundholm"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

As communities across the world have had to dispense with staples of everyday life – attending live theatre performances being one of these –, so art, in all its forms, has never been more significant in its capacity to bring us together, even if modes of togetherness have shifted in their referentiality and locationality. As the article proposes, we need to take an intuitive approach to the appreciation of how our ecologies – in their broadest iteration – have been impacted and realigned by the COVID-19 pandemic in such ways that we can expect that our future scholarship(s) on plays, place, and landscape will and, indeed, ought to reflect this experience. Dialogues on theatre and environment, which are already intersectional, are now receiving yet another focusing lens through the pandemic.The article also suggests that our understandings of how our ecologies have been adapted invite a consideration of new modes of engaging with the environment in our discourses – and of the very term itself and what it might encompass – and new economies in calibrating our discourses to reflect our radically redistributed individual and collective experiences. The text offers examples of categories that emerge particularly strongly where spatial liminality is key; in so doing, it asserts that in-betweenness is a central element towards understanding our contemporary role and responsibilities: from collapsing binaries (environment/economy) to the unmoored experience of our times.","[{""name"": ""Vicky Angelaki"", ""affiliation"": [""Mid Sweden University , Sundsvall Sweden""]}]","[""10.1215/01610775-25-1-23"", ""10.4324/9781315393186"", ""10.4324/9781003028888"", ""10.1111/j.1467-954X.2010.01887.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Cultural Studies', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

10.1386/josc_00096_1,JOURNAL OF SCREENWRITING,1303 Drama Film and Television,Writing for instructional screens: Expanding the scope for screenwriting practitioners,"At the beginning of the pandemic, discussions in the Screenwriting Research Network questioned the validity of educating students for limited career opportunities as future screenwriters. Research into graduate pathways suggests employment opportunities for creative practitioners are far more complex with many creative practitioners embedded in diverse industries such as marketing, information technology and, primarily, the education sector. The rapid growth of online education presents a key opportunity for screenwriters to apply their craft skills and knowledge to an alternative disciplinary context. Storytelling, as a means of engaging learners or an audience, is a major area of overlap for screenwriters and designers of instructional resources. Stories that emotionally engage an audience have greater impact on the learner and assist in memory retention. A key tool for emotional engagement is the use of humour which has also been shown to facilitate learning. Writers of narrative comedy possess skills in creating humorous situations that can present challenging or serious topics through a comic perspective. This article argues that the growth in online education presents screenwriting graduates with unique opportunities to apply their skills to an alternative discipline that can streamline their transition to a career in writing for screens beyond traditional film and television.","[{""name"": ""Susan Cake"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000089150953 Queensland University of Technology""]}]","[""10.1080/03634523.2010.496867"", ""10.1386/josc.8.3.225_1"", ""10.1177/1474022208088648"", ""10.18848/2325-128X/CGP/v15i01/231-252"", ""10.1386/josc.1.1.83/1"", ""10.1177/1527476412452798"", ""10.1007/BF02504866"", ""10.1177/1046878109341390"", ""10.1007/s11528-021-00643-3"", ""10.1080/13639080.2014.997684"", ""10.1386/josc_00012_1"", ""10.1386/jmpr.5.2.89/0"", ""10.1386/josc.8.2.177_1"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3801_6"", ""10.1080/09523980902933318"", ""10.1080/07294360.2016.1238883"", ""10.1386/josc.4.2.149_1"", ""10.1007/s11423-015-9372-y"", ""10.1080/03075078512331378726"", ""10.1016/0362-3319(91)90040-B"", ""10.1080/09523987.2019.1614322"", ""10.1007/BF02300453"", ""10.1037/pspi0000041"", ""10.2307/25160289"", ""10.1386/josc_00096_1""]","['Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['Speech and Hearing', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"

This article argues, through as yet unpublished plays and rehearsal documents, that Teatro Luna’s creative processes and performances generate hopeful moments of what Jill Dolan calls the “utopian performative.” Building on the work of Dolan and of José Esteban Muñoz, this case study examines how a sampling of Teatro Luna’s early and current work creates possibilities for social change, representation, and collective consciousness through the company’s Latina and women of colour-centred creative practices and dramatic work. At the same time, it argues for a strategic reading of plays including The Maria Chronicles, GL2010, Lovesick, and The Times through a critical understanding of Teatro Luna’s 2015 manifesto. This analysis illuminates the qualities that the utopian performative has for the broader field of Latina theatre and argues for a new way of thinking of these moments beyond the space of the theatre and the time of performance.","[{""name"": ""Melissa Huerta"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-1-137-02131-1"", ""10.3138/md.45.4.495"", ""10.3998/mpub.119520"", ""10.3998/mpub.6010336"", ""10.5250/fronjwomestud.32.1.0102"", ""10.2979/MER.2006.7.1.19"", ""10.2307/j.ctt46n76g"", ""10.1353/tj.2000.0020"", ""10.4135/9781412976145.n1"", ""10.3138/9781442673908"", ""10.3998/mpub.2395967"", ""10.4324/9781315545356"", ""10.1080/07407708508571085""]",['Social Sciences'],['Cultural Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Marvin Carlson’s concept of ghosting explains how an audience’s previous experience with a person or object can carry a trace into subsequent roles, which explains how these readings were possible for a certain portion of those watching Erin Markey as Squeaky Fromme in the 2017 City Center Encores! production of Assassins and Katrina Lenk as Bobbie in the 2022 production of Company. Although there was nothing inherently queer about these two characters within their respective Sondheim productions, Markey’s performance history and Lenk’s well-known role as Manke in Paula Vogel’s Indecent ghosted prior performances of queerness onto Markey’s Squeaky Fromme and Lenk’s Bobbie. This reading provides a way for a queer viewer to find representations of queerness in Assassins and Company that live outside of the gay male experience, which ends up being particularly inclusive for bisexual and lesbian women audience members and performers. By following the author’s phenomenological experience of reading these two roles as queer women within their specific musicals, this article posits that spaces for queer women, non-binary people and trans people can and should be explored in the works of Stephen Sondheim.","[{""name"": ""Bess Rowen"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000103816134 Villanova University""]}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Cultural Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

Having this feedback loop of sensation interrupted can feel profoundly disorienting, even smothering and threatening, as the author discovered when he first visited an anechoic chamber—a soundproof room in which acoustic reflections are virtually absent. This essay is a meditation on the role that sound, vibration, and sensation play in allowing us to feel at home in the world. To work through this proposition, Akiyama stages an imaginary performance event in the anechoic chamber at IRCAM (an institute for the study of sonic art and technology in Paris). This fictitious event brings together a group of expert listeners, including Alvin Lucier, one of the leading figures in conceptual sound art; Maryanne Amacher, a pioneering sound artist, composer, and psychoacoustics researcher; Daniel Kish, the found of World Access for the Blind and a noted expert in human echolocation; and Arthur Russell, a composer and producer who was at the vanguard of the New York downtown music scene in the 1980s, until his tragic, early death from AIDS. Each figure, different in their expertise and capacities, brings one closer to the realization that one’s ability to feel at home in the world is inextricably linked to our sensorial entanglement with our surroundings.","[{""name"": ""Mitchell Akiyama"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S1478572217000081"", ""10.2752/174589312X13173255802120"", ""10.1080/07341510220150306"", ""10.1121/1.382104"", ""10.5040/9781501382796"", ""10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.42130""]","['Psychology', 'Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"

10.1093/adaptation/apae010,ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES,1303 Drama Film and Television,Wong Kar-wai's Argentine Affair: Happy Together as a Translingual and Multimodal Adaptation,"Abstract In 2021, a 4K-restored rendition of Wong Kar-wai’s iconic film Happy Together (1997) returned to theatres across Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Argentina, marking the film’s enduring transnational appeal two decades after its Cannes premiere. This article investigates the film’s intricate cultural ties to Argentina. I argue that Happy Together not only enhances the cultural connections between Hong Kong and Argentina but also showcases Wong’s translingual and multimodal approaches to film adaptation. ‘Translingual’ refers to the film’s literary source: I demonstrate how Wong skilfully wove elements from Manuel Puig's 1973 novel The Buenos Aires Affair into his film through a threefold Spanish-English-Chinese process of rewriting. Subsequently, I contend that various cultural facets of Argentina—the literature of Puig, the soundscape of Piazzolla’s tango, and the landscapes of the Iguazú Falls and Tierra del Fuego—contributed significantly to the Hong Kong auteur’s multimodal adaptation. In short, this article proposes a dialogic perspective on Hong Kong cinema by considering Argentina as a reflective mirror brimming with aesthetic and geopolitical implications.

Focusing on the 1996 West End musical, the essay proposes that the conventions of musical theatre allowed this adaptation to revise earlier versions of the story in response to then-current concerns in historiography, in particular, those of new historicist criticism. It argues that the musical’s focus on the female lead’s knowledge and consent, informed by the cultural context of the 1990s, constituted a key intervention in the adaptive history of the Martin Guerre story. And it examines the musical’s engagement with new historicist ideas about the contingency of early modern identity, noting that the lyrics and structure present a contrast between a contingent identity reliant on property ownership, kinship bonds, and religious community with a more ‘modern’ identity based on psychological continuity and unique selfhood. In conclusion, the essay proposes Martin Guerre as a case study for broader questions about how historical individuals’ agency can be represented in adaptation.","[{""name"": ""Sally Barnden"", ""affiliation"": [""Swansea University , UK""]}]","[""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195385946.013.0004"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521300148.006""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

We contextualize their actions and choices to unpack how their work and efforts fit into an industry still dominated by men and influenced by a culture of masculinity idealizing the male genius. In the first section, we discuss how the women experienced their first encounters with the industry and what strategies they developed at this stage. In the second section, we discuss women’s deliberations about how to make work on the set manageable and productive. In the final section, we investigate various strategies related to work opportunities and the possibilities for women to realize their visions and their passion for making films.","[{""name"": ""Maria Jansson"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107388966 Örebro University""]}, {""name"": ""Louise Wallenberg"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369377 Stockholm University""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1468-0432.2010.00535.x"", ""10.1080/10286630902923323"", ""10.3366/jbctv.2020.0510"", ""10.1080/14680777.2011.537029"", ""10.1057/9781137282187_12"", ""10.1177/1350506817692387"", ""10.1386/jsca_00023_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-39070-9_10"", ""10.1080/14680777.2018.1456158"", ""10.1093/screen/16.3.6"", ""10.1177/1527476414557952"", ""10.1353/bio.2010.0645"", ""10.1386/jsca_00073_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Urban Studies', 'Gender Studies', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

The essay highlights the results of a quantitative and qualitative study on the portrayal and self-portrayal of Italian women scientists based on the digital editions of eight daily national newspapers and ten talk shows on the main national television channels from February to May 2020. The aim of the study is to show if and how those women scientists were valued as ‘experts’ or, alternatively, discredited professionally. The picture that emerges is ambivalent: on the one hand, most journalists of both sexes minimize the role of women scientists, and on the other hand, their ability to appear as authoritative in science as their male colleagues makes us optimistic about the role they can hypothetically play in convincing the new generation of Italian women to study STEM subjects.","[{""name"": ""Saveria Capecchi"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000417571758 University of Bologna""]}]","[""10.1086/228951"", ""10.1177/0963662518801257"", ""10.1177/0163443711418272"", ""10.1080/15358593.2012.666559"", ""10.1386/jicms_00179_1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)]]"

Following a microhistorical approach, rooted in Translator Studies, we discuss the agency and positioning of Kierstede as one of the few female interpreters in a multilingual colonial contact zone. We use different historical and secondary sources and reinterpret them from a translatological perspective to explore Kierstede’s interactions and relations with other stakeholders as linguistic go-between and official provincial interpreter in Dutch colonial encounters and her role as an influential woman and cultural mediator in the self-contained network of relationships that characterised Dutch colonial society in New Amsterdam.","[{""name"": ""Waltraud Kolb"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Vienna""]}, {""name"": ""Sonja Pöllabauer"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Vienna""]}]","[""10.2307/j.ctt1ckpfkh.8"", ""10.7202/013276ar"", ""10.7202/019926ar"", ""10.7146/hjlcb.v22i42.96844"", ""10.7202/002529ar"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1h0p39b"", ""10.1075/btl.156.03ebe"", ""10.2307/481424"", ""10.4324/9781315746418"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004162112.i-628"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004178342.i-268.30"", ""10.1515/9789048530007-005"", ""10.1086/448699"", ""10.2307/482433"", ""10.1075/tis.19029.hei"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-5272-0_5"", ""10.2307/1184083"", ""10.4324/9781315746418-4"", ""10.4324/9780203500637"", ""10.4324/9780203500637"", ""10.1080/13556509.2014.899094"", ""10.1075/btl.67.27poc"", ""10.4324/9781315649573"", ""10.7146/hjlcb.v22i42.96845"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1ckpfkh.5"", ""10.2307/3491741"", ""10.1075/btl.142.32wak""]","['Social Sciences', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Language and Linguistics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
