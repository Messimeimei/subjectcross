Tokens represent a transparent, auditable origin and provenance for a piece of digital art. Blockchain technology allows tokens to be held and securely traded without the involvement of third parties. Crypto art draws its origins from conceptual art—sharing the immaterial and distributive nature of artworks, the tight blending of artworks with currency and the rejection of conventional art markets and institutions. The authors propose a collection of viewpoints on crypto art from different actors within the system: artists, collectors, gallerists, art historians and data scientists. A set of emerging themes and open challenges surfaces.","[('Massimo Franceschet', 'Massimo Franceschet, Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics, University of Udine.

Visual indeterminacy describes images that appear to depict real scenes, but on closer examination, defy coherent spatial interpretation. GAN models seem to be predisposed to producing indeterminate images, and indeterminacy is a key feature of much modern representational art, as well as most GAN art. The author hypothesizes that indeterminacy is a consequence of a powerful-but-imperfect image synthesis model that must combine general classes of objects, scenes and textures.","[('Aaron Hertzmann', 'Adobe Research 601 Townsend St San Francisco, CA 94103 U.S.A.')]",['10.1023/A:1026553619983'],MIT Press - Journals

Here I offer some considerations that suggest that such individualism is a mistake and sketch a communitarian way of posing and answering questions about the nature of aesthetic value.","[('Nick Riggle', 'Department of Philosophy, University of San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA')]","['10.2307/2026797', '10.1111/phpr.12641', '10.1353/hph.2014.0020', '10.1111/phpr.12727', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199691517.003.0011', '10.1093/oso/9780197625798.001.0001', '10.1093/aesthj/ayaa006', '10.1080/24740500.2017.1287034', '10.1086/662744', '10.1093/aesthj/ayz024', '10.1080/00048400903207104', '10.1093/aesthj/ayy044', '10.1111/phpr.12747', '10.1111/j.1468-0114.2012.01429.x', '10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01519.x', '10.1111/j.1747-9991.2006.00007.x', '10.1093/aesthj/ays038']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

I argue that the experience of the sublime is best conceived as a species of awe, namely, as aesthetic awe.

In maintaining that the experience of the sublime is best conceived as aesthetic awe, I draw from historical theories of the sublime as well as recent work in empirical psychology.","[('Robert R Clewis', 'Philosophy, Gwynedd Mercy University, Gwynedd Valley, PA 19437, USA')]","['10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01340', '10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00509', '10.1017/CBO9781139018098', '10.1017/CBO9780511978920', '10.1515/9780804798587', '10.1111/jaac.12060', '10.1037/a0027200', '10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00271.x', '10.1037/pspp0000120', '10.1111/jaac.12258', '10.1037/aca0000204', '10.3389/fnhum.2014.00891', '10.1080/02699930302297', '10.5840/philtoday201155162', '10.1007/s11098-012-9873-z', '10.1111/jaac.12595', '10.1037/rev0000213', '10.1163/22134913-00002051', '10.1037/aca0000273', '10.1017/CBO9781139775304', '10.1111/j.1475-4975.1997.tb00529.x', '10.1093/aesthj/ayaa047', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac51.4.0541', '10.1037/rev0000187', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198747758.001.0001', '10.1080/17439760.2018.1484940', '10.1037/emo0000450']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

10.1093/aesthj/ayaa006,BRITISH JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Schiller on Freedom and Aesthetic Value: Part I,[],"Abstract In his Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man, Friedrich Schiller draws a striking connection between aesthetic value and individual and political freedom, claiming that, ‘it is only through beauty that man makes his way to freedom’. However, contemporary ways of thinking about freedom and aesthetic value make it difficult to see what the connection could be. Through a careful reconstruction of the Letters, we argue that Schiller’s theory of aesthetic value serves as the key to understanding not only his view of aesthetic engagement, but also his distinctive account of individual and political freedom. In Part I, we develop a reconstruction of Schiller's view that aesthetic value is the only path to individual freedom and in Part II we analyze how Schiller connects aesthetic value to political freedom. In the end, we show that Schiller defends a non-hedonic, action-oriented, communitarian theory of aesthetic value and a theory of freedom that makes the aesthetic not just supererogatory but fundamental for any fully autonomous life. Although we have lost touch with this way of thinking about aesthetic value and freedom, we submit that it is illuminating for contemporary thinking about both.","[('Samantha Matherne', 'Harvard University'), ('Nick Riggle', 'University of San Diego')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

I develop my argument in three steps. First, I begin by describing a type of aesthetic experience that is grounded in a set of imaginative activities on the part of the person having the experience. Second, I argue that the same set of imaginative activities that grounds this type of aesthetic experience also contributes to achievements of understanding. Third, I show that my unified account of imagination has important implications: it sheds light on two puzzling phenomena, the aesthetic value of science and the cognitive value of art.","[('Angela Breitenbach', 'University of Cambridge')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

While this has enlivened the practice, there remains significant disagreement over who or what actually deserves to be called an AI artist. This article examines several claimants to the term and grounds these in art history and theory. It addresses the controversial elevation of some artists over others and accounts for these choices, arguing that the art market alienates AI artists from their work. Finally, it proposes that AI art’s interactions with art institutions have not promoted new creative possibilities but have instead reinforced conservative forms and aesthetics.","[('Kieran Browne', 'Kieran Browne, Australian National University, Research School of Humanities & the Arts, Canberra ACT 0200.

This assumption seems to entail not only that facility with imagining will vary from one person to another, but also that people can improve their own imaginative capacities and learn to be better imaginers. This paper takes up this issue. After showing why this is properly understood as a philosophical question, I discuss what it means to say that one imagining is better than another and then discuss the kinds of imagination training and techniques that might be employed in an effort to get better at imagining. The discussion of these techniques draws insight from consideration of other skills-based activities, as well as from consideration of the creation of art and our engagement with literature and poetry. Over the course of this discussion, we also gain further insight into the nature of imagination.","[('Amy Kind', 'Claremont McKenna College, USA')]","['10.1037/0033-295X.100.3.363', '10.4324/9781315180809', '10.2307/2025838', '10.4324/9781351199797-17', '10.1111/j.1933-1592.2001.tb00042.x', '10.1017/apa.2017.10', '10.4324/9781315180809-33', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198716808.003.0001', '10.2307/2185044', '10.2307/2183914', '10.1086/203305', '10.1111/phc3.12359', '10.1080/10413209108406438', '10.1016/0001-6918(53)90012-2', '10.1111/nous.12144', '10.2307/2107292', '10.1016/S0001-2092(06)62917-7']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

However, does art contribute something unique to political discourse, or does it merely reflect the insights of political science and political philosophy? Here I argue for indispensability of art to political discourse by building on the debate about artistic cognitivism, the view that art is a source of knowledge. Different artforms, I suggest, make available specific epistemic resources, which allow audiences to overcome epistemic obstacles that obtain in a given ideological situation. My goal is to offer a general model for identifying cognitive advantages for artworks belonging to distinct artforms and genres (e.g. satire, visibility-raising artworks, caricatures, and so on), in a way that can account for each artwork’s historical and cultural specificity. More speculatively, however, my account also comments on the ancient struggle between philosophy and the arts as competing modes of persuasion, and expands our notion of legitimate political discourse to include a greater plurality of discursive genres.","[('Vid Simoniti', 'University of Liverpool , UK')]","['10.1111/cons.12005', '10.1111/j.1475-4975.2009.00186.x', '10.1111/1540-6245.00048', '10.1093/oso/9780198826903.001.0001', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199263219.001.0001', '10.1002/9781444315592.ch18', '10.1007/978-1-349-15388-6_3', '10.7551/mitpress/1564.001.0001', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac56.4.0331', '10.1111/japp.12347', '10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2', '10.1177/0090591704265729', '10.2307/1600311', '10.1002/9780470696675']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

10.1093/aesthj/ayaa047,BRITISH JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,A Two-Tiered Theory of the Sublime,[],"AbstractBy the start of the twenty-first century, the notion of ‘the sublime’ had come to seem incoherent. In the last ten years or so considerable light has been shed by empirical psychologists on a related notion of ‘awe’, and a fruitful dialogue between aestheticians and empirical psychologists has ensued. It is the aim of this paper to synthesize these advances and to offer what I call a ‘two-tiered’ theory of the sublime that shows it to be a coherent aesthetic category. On this theory, sublime experiences begin in an ‘awe response’ (the ‘thin sublime’) and might, with the additional element of temporally-extended reflection, turn into a ‘thick sublime’ response. Building on accounts of the sublime as a species of ‘aesthetic awe’ (Clewis, 2019a and 2019b; Arcangeli, et al., 2020) I aim to show that this two-tiered theory helps to explain why sublime experiences seem to have a basic, primordial core, but also seem to be historically and culturally quite variable (as Nicolson, 1963 [1959]; Battersby, 2007; and McMahon, 2017 have stressed). On this model, the cultural and historical variability comes in largely at the point of the temporally-extended reflection characteristic of the thick sublime, due to the cognitive stock that the subject brings to the encounter. Thus, sublime experiences really lend themselves to being interpreted quite variously by the subject (as well as by the theorist) of these experiences, as, for example, affording insight into the Divine, our moral vocation, or our metaphysical unity with the entire universe, among other lofty thoughts.","[('Sandra Shapshay', 'City University of New York, USA')]","['10.5040/9781350038950.ch-009', '10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01340', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199329397.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9781139018098', '10.1093/0199259658.001.0001', '10.1080/02699931.2012.683852', '10.1017/CBO9780511978920.015', '10.1016/0304-422X(86)90003-3', '10.1111/jaac.12060', '10.1002/0470013494.ch16', '10.2307/303363', '10.1037/aca0000204', '10.3389/fnhum.2014.00891', '10.1093/mind/os-IX.34.188', '10.1017/CBO9780511978920.010', '10.1017/CBO9780511804656', '10.1080/02699930302297', '10.3389/fnhum.2016.00536', '10.1111/jaac.12595', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199658442.001.0001', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198528975.003.0004', '10.1057/9781137313713.0011', '10.1196/annals.1280.029', '10.1080/02699930600923668', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac51.4.0541']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

I then show that under certain conditions, this can lead to eventual metaphysical destruction of the artwork; a way to destroy harmful art without physically destroying it.","[('Daisy Dixon', 'Peterhouse, University of Cambridge , Cambridge , UK')]","['10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199585960.001.0001', '10.1111/1467-9973.00131', '10.1093/aesthj/ayz006', '10.1525/9780520930988', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199609581.003.0014', '10.2307/2182440', '10.7208/chicago/9780226365541.001.0001', '10.5840/monist197458217', '10.1111/j.1527-2001.2012.01316.x', '10.1111/ejop.12573', '10.1093/oso/9780198738831.001.0001', '10.5840/soctheorpract201711125', '10.1093/aesthj/ayp072', '10.1007/BF00258436', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199236282.003.0005', '10.1007/s11229-020-02944-1', '10.1080/00048400802370334', '10.1007/978-94-010-1063-4', '10.1016/S0378-2166(00)00060-6', '10.1017/CBO9781139173438', '10.1023/A:1020867916902', '10.2307/2183301', '10.4159/harvard.9780674065086']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Despite its importance, he says little about it. He characterizes aesthetic ideas as representations of the imagination and says that the gift of artistic genius is the inscrutable capacity to envision them. Furthermore, they are counterparts of rational ideas. Works of art thus sensibly present rational ideas; the pleasure they occasion is a consequence of the enriching process of reflection upon the wealth of content they sensibly present. The purpose of this article is to ask whether all rational ideas have aesthetic ideas as counterparts, and so can be presented in art, or whether only some do and which. The answer should reveal what, for Kant, is the subject-matter of art. I argue that for Kant art is concerned with the range and variety of human freedom as well as with its highest fulfillment in morality.","[('Ido Geiger', 'Department of Philosophy, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel')]","['10.1017/CBO9780511612671', '10.1080/0960878042000253123', '10.1093/aesthj/ayl023', '10.1080/00048400701571677', '10.1093/aesthj/ayn019', '10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00243.x', '10.1080/0020174X.2020.1779124', '10.1093/bjaesthetics/7.3.250', '10.1111/ejop.12524', '10.1057/978-1-137-53517-7_6', '10.1017/CBO9780511814433', '10.1017/CBO9780511804649', '10.1017/CBO9780511804656', '10.1017/CBO9780511791925', '10.1515/kant.1984.75.1-4.65', '10.1093/aesthj/ays058', '10.1515/kant.2010.002', '10.1111/0021-8529.00018', '10.1515/hgjb-2017-0107', '10.1017/S1369415418000079', '10.1093/jaac/kpaa005', '10.1515/kant-2018-0002', '10.1093/aesthj/ayi035', '10.1093/bjaesthetics/30.1.71', '10.1111/j.1467-9213.2011.695_13.x', '10.1080/00201750510022727']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Such epistemic value might take the form of knowledge (for ‘cognitivists’) or understanding (for ‘neo-cognitivists’). Both camps may be sorted according to a further distinction between views explaining fiction’s epistemic value either in terms of the author’s engaging in a form of telling, or instead via their showing some state of affairs to obtain, a special case of which is the provision of self-knowledge. Fictional works that show rather than tell often employ thought experiments. The epistemic value of some fictional works is indicated by their enabling of empathy, itself illuminated via the psychological process of experience-taking. Whether a fictional work offers epistemic value by telling or showing, there is, in principle, no bar to its being able to deliver on what it offers, and consumers of fiction who exercise epistemic vigilance may gain either knowledge or some degree of understanding from their engagement with it.","[('Mitchell Green', '')]","['10.1111/j.1540-6245.2010.01433.x', '10.1080/09658211.2012.682067', '10.1093/oso/9780199656615.001.0001', '10.1017/CBO9780511897498', '10.1093/aesthj/ayab072', '10.3758/s13421-020-01047-z', '10.1111/jaac.12270', '10.1162/POSC_a_00128', '10.1057/9780230227453_8', '10.1111/j.1467-9264.2012.00331.x', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669639.003.0012', '10.1163/18756735-09603013', '10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00144.x', '10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195182637.003.0021', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199283781.001.0001', '10.1002/9781444302813.ch4', '10.1002/9781444315592.ch18', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198715719.003.0016', '10.1007/978-3-319-56883-6_4', '10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.701', '10.2307/48616060', '10.1111/1467-9213.00152', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac56.4.0331', '10.1037/a0027525', '10.1126/science.1239918', '10.1093/aesthj/ayz040', '10.1017/apa.2017.16', '10.1177/0963721416649347', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199297023.001.0001', '10.1111/phc3.12068', '10.1093/oso/9780198798347.001.0001', '10.1163/18756735-09603015', '10.1007/s12136-021-00467-z']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Results show that the Chinese traditional handicraft learning mode based on WebAR affords embodied interaction and improves learning between real context and virtual devices; thus WebAR devices enhance embodied interaction of traditional handicraft simulations.

We commonly describe music as “heavy,” whether as criticism or praise. But what does “heavy” mean? How is it applied as an aesthetic term? Drawing on sociological and musicological studies of heavy metal, as well as recent work on the aesthetics of rock music, I discuss the relevant musical properties of heaviness. The modest aim of this article, however, is to show the difficulty, if not impossibility, of this seemingly straightforward task. I first address the difficulties of identifying the defining features, or “Gestalt,” of heavy metal that would allow us to treat heaviness as a genre concept. Next, I discuss both the merits and the limits of analyzing heaviness in terms of an aesthetics of “noise” in rock music developed in recent philosophy of music. In the remaining sections, I consider other nonaesthetic features relevant to aesthetic judgments of heaviness and show that the term ‘heavy’ is conceptually inarticulable, if not irreducible. This, I conclude, has partly to do with the radically different, sometimes incompatible, musical properties present in the perception of musical heaviness.","[('Jason Miller', 'Department of Philosophy, Warren Wilson College, Asheville, NC, USA')]","['10.1111/jaac.12351', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac51.1.0023', '10.1515/9781474465489-006', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac57.2.0193', '10.1386/mms.4.1.95_1', '10.1111/phc3.12145', '10.2307/2182490', '10.1111/j.1533-1598.2003.tb00114.x', '10.2307/j.ctv1220q3v', '10.2307/2183933', '10.1080/19401159.2013.846655', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac53.1.0078']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The curator of a recent exhibition of Pierre Bonnard at the Tate Gallery in London encouraged viewers to look slowly in order to enrich their experience of Bonnard’s paintings. This article explores some of the reasons why Bonnard’s work, in particular, rewards the viewer who spends more time studying it. The authors draw on various scientific studies of the ways in which observers process color contrasts, spatial configuration and figure-ground segregation in artworks and in everyday vision. They propose that prolonged interactions with works of art can facilitate perceptual learning, and they suggest ways in which these effects could be empirically studied using psychological methods.","[('Rebecca Chamberlain', 'Rebecca Chamberlain, Goldsmiths, University of London, 8 Lewisham Way, New Cross, London, SE14 6NW, U.K. Email: r.chamberlain@gold.ac.uk.'), ('Robert Pepperell', 'Robert Pepperell, School of Art & Design, Cardiff Metropolitan University, 200 Western Avenue, Cardiff, CF5 2YB, U.K. Email: rpepperell@cardiffmet.ac.uk.')]","['10.2190/5MQM-59JH-X21R-JN5J', '10.1177/2041669517694184', '10.1037/11526-000', '10.1371/journal.pone.0099019', '10.5406/jaesteduc.53.1.0106', '10.1016/j.visres.2008.06.010', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.07-11-03416.1987', '10.3389/fnhum.2011.00104', '10.1038/s41467-018-07830-6', '10.1068/i0668', '10.1163/22134913-00002056', '10.1037/a0029333', '10.1006/cogp.1996.0018', '10.1016/j.brainresbull.2007.04.009', '10.1016/0028-3932(95)00014-T', '10.1068/p5262']",MIT Press - Journals

According to ethicism, aesthetically relevant ethical flaws in artworks count as aesthetic flaws and aesthetically relevant ethical merits count as aesthetic merits. In this paper, I argue that ethicism’s most significant argument, the Merited Response Argument (MRA) (and other moralist arguments like it) suffers from an ambiguity that makes it either unsound or uninteresting. Specifically, the notion of an artwork’s ‘prescribing’ a response, central to MRA, is ambiguous between merely attempting to elicit a response from appreciators as appropriate to a work, and endorsing a response as appropriate to relevant parts of the actual world. While the first sense of ‘prescribe’ does the aesthetic work, the second does the ethical.","[('Nils-Hennes Stear', 'University of Southampton and Uppsala Universitet')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

By distinguishing how statues speak at the locutionary level versus at the illocutionary level, or what they say versus what they do, we obtain the resource for addressing two topics. First, we can explain what makes statues distinct from street art. Second, we can explain why it is mistaken to criticize—or to defend—the continuing presence of statues based only on what they represent. Both explanations are driven by the same core idea: the significance of statues arises primarily from what they do and not what they say.","[('David Friedell', 'Philosophy Department, Union College , Schenectady, NY , USA'), ('Shen-yi Liao', 'Philosophy Department, University of Puget Sound , Tacoma, WA , USA')]","['10.1093/aesthj/ayv030', '10.1111/jaac.12261', '10.1111/jaac.12325', '10.1007/s11406-007-9065-9', '10.1093/oso/9780198738831.003.0001', '10.5840/wpr19931021', '10.4324/9780429462573-10', '10.1111/ejop.12573', '10.1111/papq.12000', '10.1111/phpr.12701', '10.1111/papa.12162', '10.1353/cjp.0.0050', '10.1023/B:LING.0000010803.47264.f0', '10.1080/00048400802370334', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199236282.001.0001', '10.5840/soctheorpract201642215', '10.1111/papq.12279', '10.1086/707215', '10.2307/431994', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac52.1.0013', '10.26556/jesp.v18i1.696', '10.1111/j.1467-9264.2006.00195.x', '10.5840/tpm20209189', '10.1111/jopp.12176', '10.1111/1467-9752.12582', '10.1007/BF00188849', '10.5840/soctheorpract201642218', '10.1111/1467-9752.12580']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

10.1093/jaac/kpab002,JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS AND ART CRITICISM,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,What Is the Monumental?,[],"AbstractThe aesthetic category of the sublime has been theorized (especially in the Kantian tradition) as integrally intertwined with the moral. Paradigmatic experiences of the sublime, such as gazing up at the starry night sky, or out at a storm-whipped sea, lead in a moral or religious direction depending on the cognitive stock brought to the experience, since they typically involve a feeling of awe and reflection on the peculiar situation of the human being in nature. The monumental is a similar aesthetic category, integrally intertwined with the political, but, by contrast, has garnered almost no attention from aestheticians. My main goal in this paper is to sketch a theory of ‘the monumental’ as an aesthetic category—one that is a species of the sublime but differs qualitatively from the natural/environmental sublime in significant ways, and thus merits a distinctive label. In doing so, I aim to shed light on the nature and power of monuments specifically, and to begin to address a lacuna in our understanding of a long-standing and culturally important form of public art.","[('Sandra Shapshay', 'Hunter College and the Graduate Center, CUNY, New York, NY, USA')]","['10.1111/j.1540-6245.2008.00306.x', '10.5040/9781350038950.ch-009', '10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01340', '10.1017/CBO9781139018098', '10.1111/jaac.12596', '10.1093/bjaesthetics/36.3.223', '10.1017/CBO9780511978920', '10.7312/evan18758', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199263219.001.0001', '10.1037/aca0000204', '10.3389/fnhum.2014.00891', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac54.1.0015', '10.1080/02699930302297', '10.1111/jaac.12595', '10.1515/9780691186658-010', '10.1093/aesthj/ays067', '10.1057/9781137313713', '10.1111/jaac.12600', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198747758.001.0001']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

This paper offers a definition of street art as an art kind or art form based on its essential value: its subversiveness. It argues that street art is essentially subversive in virtue of using public space as a technical resource. By hijacking a portion of the urban landscape with its colourful forms and witty designs, street art challenges familiar ways of practising the city, while creating a ‘temporary autonomous zone’ of free expression. There, corporate control over the city’s visible surfaces is ridiculed and people reclaim their right to use the city. In this sense, street art functions as a carnivalesque tactic of social resistance, favouring the emergence of alternative ways to imagine our urban life and our uses of public space. By considering its subversiveness, one can also explain how street art (i) significantly differs from official public art; (ii) includes graffiti as its original and most radical style.","[('Andrea Lorenzo Baldini', '')]","['10.1080/13604810903529142', '10.1093/monist/onx033', '10.1093/aesthj/ayv030', '10.1353/aq.2007.0077', '10.1111/jaac.12261', '10.1177/1470412915592883', '10.1080/01944360108976352', '10.1080/00233609.2012.762804', '10.1080/00233609.2015.1095797', '10.1111/jaac.12325', '10.1375/acri.35.2.165', '10.1111/j.1467-8330.2011.00849.x', '10.2307/2169636', '10.1177/1206331213512052', '10.1386/vi.7.1.19_1', '10.1111/papq.12279', '10.1080/10304312.2013.854867', '10.1080/21502552.2014.878487', '10.1111/jaac.12280', '10.1016/j.jbusres.2009.02.003', '10.1017/S0031819100065785']",Helsinki University Press

Although some philosophers claim that aesthetics falls within the scope of rationality, a non-akrasia constraint prohibiting certain combinations of attitudes is yet to be developed in this domain. This essay is concerned with the question of whether such a requirement is plausible and, if so, whether it is an actual requirement of aesthetic rationality. Ultimately, this paper defends the view that aesthetics is no different from other domains in that it requires coherence between a subject’s mental states (in the aesthetic case, between what is judged and what is aesthetically liked).","[('Irene Martínez Marín', 'Uppsala University , Sweden')]","['10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199685523.001.0001', '10.1002/9781118609088', '10.1080/00455091.2015.1118231', '10.5406/jaesteduc.50.4.0001', '10.1093/mind/fzz018', '10.1017/CBO9780511663888.004', '10.5840/logos-episteme20211211', '10.3389/fpsyg.2020.577703', '10.1111/nous.12310', '10.5840/jphil201811538', '10.1007/s11098-021-01775-1', '10.1007/s11098-010-9570-8', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199547975.001.0001', '10.1086/698732', '10.2307/432348', '10.2307/2564667', '10.1007/978-1-4020-5265-1_10', '10.1111/nous.12026', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac34.1.0051', '10.1007/s11098-018-1196-2', '10.1007/s11098-010-9651-8', '10.1111/j.1540-6245.2010.01398.x', '10.1007/s11098-009-9418-2', '10.1007/s11406-017-9905-1', '10.1515/9783110496765-006', '10.1080/00048408012341341', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199753673.003.0002', '10.1093/aesthj/ayj020', '10.1111/j.1755-2567.2009.01049.x', '10.1017/S0265052500001734', '10.1111/phpr.12246', '10.1111/nous.12362', '10.1111/mila.12070']",Oxford University Press (OUP)
10.1093/aesthj/ayaa005,BRITISH JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Schiller on Freedom and Aesthetic Value: Part II,[],"Abstract In his Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man, Friedrich Schiller draws a striking connection between aesthetic value and individual and political freedom, claiming that, ‘it is only through beauty that man makes his way to freedom’. However, contemporary ways of thinking about freedom and aesthetic value make it difficult to see what the connection could be. Through a careful reconstruction of the Letters, we argue that Schiller’s theory of aesthetic value serves as the key to understanding not only his view of aesthetic engagement, but also his distinctive account of individual and political freedom. Whereas in Part I, we developed a reconstruction of Schiller's view that aesthetic value is the only path to individual freedom, in Part II we analyze how Schiller connects aesthetic value to political freedom. In the end, we show that Schiller defends a non-hedonic, action-oriented, communitarian theory of aesthetic value and a theory of freedom that makes the aesthetic not just supererogatory but fundamental for any fully autonomous life. Although we have lost touch with this way of thinking about aesthetic value and freedom, we submit that it is illuminating for contemporary thinking about both.","[('Samantha Matherne', 'Harvard University'), ('Nick Riggle', 'University of San Diego')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

This view has been contested. It is, however, rarely argued that fiction can morally “corrupt” us. In this article, we focus on the alleged power of fiction to decrease one's prejudices and biases. We argue that if fiction has the power to change prejudices and biases for the better, then it can also have the opposite effect. We further argue that fictions are more likely to be a bad influence than a good one.","[('Kris Goffin', 'Department of Philosophy, Birkbeck, University of London, London, United Kingdom'), ('Kris Goffin', 'Department of Philosophy, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium'), ('Kris Goffin', 'Research Group of Quantitative Psychology and Individual Differences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium'), ('Stacie Friend', 'Department of Philosophy, Birkbeck, University of London, London, United Kingdom')]","['10.1037/0022-3514.91.4.652', '10.1007/978-1-349-00952-7', '10.1111/papq.12302', '10.1017/CBO9780511663888.005', '10.1016/j.jesp.2014.06.007', '10.1111/jaac.12440', '10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314', '10.1093/oso/9780199656615.001.0001', '10.1017/S1138741600006491', '10.1037/0033-2909.127.6.853', '10.7551/mitpress/5760.001.0001', '10.7551/mitpress/5797.001.0001', '10.1037/xge0000395', '10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01520.x', '10.3366/olr.1991.006', '10.1186/s40359-019-0299-7', '10.1111/j.1467-9264.2012.00331.x', '10.1017/CBO9780511663888.007', '10.2307/2678446', '10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.701', '10.1037/0033-295X.102.1.4', '10.1037/a0015575', '10.1075/upal.35.14hak', '10.1080/13869790500095962', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198713241.003.0004', '10.1075/ssol.3.1.08joh', '10.1126/science.1239918', '10.1037/a0036260', '10.1002/9781444302813.ch3', '10.1093/oso/9780190604981.001.0001', '10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00073.x', '10.1016/j.jesp.2015.08.002', '10.1126/science.159.3810.56', '10.1017/S0140525X09000855', '10.1027/1864-1105/a000249', '10.1037/aca0000089', '10.2307/j.ctt5vjmwc', '10.1111/1467-9280.00376', '10.1177/0146167205284004', '10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163607', '10.1037/pspa0000064', '10.1111/j.2041-6962.2011.00069.x', '10.1177/0146167203256906', '10.1080/02699931.2017.1279591', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199325603.003.0003', '10.7208/chicago/9780226767307.001.0001', '10.1086/448328', '10.1111/jasp.12279', '10.1093/aristoteliansupp/68.1.27', '10.1111/j.1751-2409.2011.01032.x', '10.1126/science.1178358', '10.1016/j.obhdp.2015.04.002', '10.1177/0276236621996244', '10.5334/jopd.ac', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2418-09.2009']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

An Empirical Study,[],"Abstract Philosophers often consider better compliance with prevalent pre-theoretical intuitions to be an advantage of a theory of ontology of musical works. However, despite many predictions of what these intuitions on relevant questions might be, so far there is only one experimental philosophy study on the repeatability of musical works by Christopher Bartel. We decided to examine the intuitions concerning the individuation of musical works by creating scenarios reflecting the differences in the positions of musical ontologists: pure and timbral sonicism, instrumentalism, and contextualism. The results show that emotional expressivity, instrument, timbre, and images evoked in the listeners were not considered as properties individuating musical works. However, the musical works were held to be different if the composers were different. In most cases, the participants had clear intuitions. Pure sonicism, complemented with additional stress on significance of the composer’s creativity, seems to be the most intuitive position.","[('Elzė Sigutė Mikalonytė', 'Vilnius University'), ('Vilius Dranseika', 'Vilnius University')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Many of those working in the field of literary studies oppose this idea. But it is not clear exactly how works of literary art embody knowledge and understanding and how literary studies can bring these to the light. After all, literary works of art are pieces of fiction, which suggests that they are not meant to represent the actual world. How then can they deliver knowledge and understanding? I argue that literature and literary studies confer knowledge and understanding in at least five ways: they give us insight into the work and the world of the work of art in question, they shape our intellectual virtues, they invite us to apply various hypotheses, they deliver moral propositional knowledge, and they increase or bring about full understanding with respect to meaning, virtue, and significance. In the course of my argument, I refer at several junctures to Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the D’Urbervilles and Edith Wharton’s Summer, in order to illustrate each of these claims.","[('Rik Peels', 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

Close examination of thirteenth‐century paintings from Arabic manuscripts, considered alongside textual sources, reveals how images may contribute to the study of slavery in the premodern Middle East. In particular, these paintings confirm the link between domestic service and the trade in black African slaves. They also suggest that if skin colour did not determine enslavement, it might have shaped the perception of slaves and the division of labour among them. This essay further attends to the semantic operations of slavery within the picture. One of its suggestions is that images of slaves functioned as signs of pure labour, as well as liminal figures, framing, highlighting, and creating a contrast with light‐skinned Arab characters, mostly seen engaged in acts of discourse and leisurely activities. A visual dialectic seems to be at work, creating a series of asymmetrical relationships, between light‐skinned and dark‐skinned, freedom and slavery, speech and labour, high culture and servitude. Such a dialectic may ultimately be read as a comment on the mechanisms and limits of archival power.","[('Lamia Balafrej', '')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

According to skeptics, these processes limit an agent’s intentional control over the features of the resultant “automatic images,” which in turn limits the artistic potential of the work, and the form as a whole. I argue that this is true only if intentional control is understood to mean that an agent produces the features of the work by their own bodily movements alone. Not only is this an unrealistic standard to uphold, but I show that a definition of intentional control based on the skeptic’s position does not prohibit an agent from realizing the features of an image by means beyond their own actions. An agent can exercise intentional control over the features of an image if they successfully anticipate the effect that the remote consequences of their actions will have on these. This, I argue, entails that to exert intentional control over the features of an image is to exercise “creative agency,” which is a species of executive agency. Consequently, I defend the idea that the origin of automatic images in creative agency grounds their artistic significance.","[('Claire Anscomb', 'Aesthetics Research Centre, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, UK')]","['10.1111/jaac.12137', '10.1007/s13194-020-00310-z', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199694853.003.0003', '10.1163/9789004335349', '10.4324/9781315266688', '10.1111/jaac.12404', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac49.1.0023', '10.1002/9780470774922', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199694853.003.0004', '10.7208/chicago/9780226370330.001.0001', '10.1093/0199278067.001.0001', '10.1002/9781119053194', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199665778.001.0001', '10.1111/1467-8365.12115', '10.2190/EM.28.1.f', '10.1086/448116', '10.1086/448062']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

The most popular version of value empiricism, and a dominant view in contemporary philosophical aesthetics more generally, is aesthetic hedonism. Hedonism restricts the grounds of aesthetic value to the pleasure enjoyed in the right kind of experience. But hedonism does not enjoy any clear advantage over a more permissive alternative version of value empiricism. This alternative is aesthetic liberalism. On this view, an object’s aesthetic value is fully grounded in any value—not just the hedonic value—of a correct and complete experience of its sensory features. To demonstrate the advantages of liberalism over hedonism, I apply both views to analyze the aesthetic value of the Spring Temple Buddha and Anselm Kiefer’s Seraphim. I detail four advantages of liberalism over hedonism, and I conclude by defending liberalism from two kinds of objection.","[('Antonia Peacocke', 'Stanford University')]","['10.1007/s11098-011-9755-9', '10.5840/jphil201811538', '10.1111/1467-9213.12026', '10.5840/jphil201110838', '10.1017/S0953820812000052', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198767213.003.0004', '10.1080/24740500.2017.1296403', '10.4324/9781315148496-2', '10.1086/662744', '10.1080/00048400903207104', '10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00199.x', '10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01519.x', '10.1017/CBO9781316286777']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

But there is another type of aesthetic idea: ‘Beauty (whether it be beauty of nature or of art) can in general be called the expression of aesthetic ideas: only in beautiful nature the mere reflection on a given intuition, without a concept of what the object ought to be, is sufficient for arousing and communicating the idea of which that object is considered as the expression.’ What are these aesthetic ideas? I argue that Kant is drawing on the idealist conception of art, associated with Vasari, Bellori and Winckelmann, as presenting idealized spatial forms characteristic of natural kinds. He incorporates this conception into his analysis of the beauty of nature and adds that we have non-conceptual access to it. These idealized forms he names aesthetic normal ideas of natural species.","[('Aviv Reiter', 'Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Israel')]","['10.1017/CBO9780511612671', '10.1093/actrade/9780198747116.book.1', '10.1080/00048400701571677', '10.4159/DLCL.marcus_tullius_cicero-de_inventione.1949', '10.1353/hph.2018.0025', '10.2307/2215614', '10.1007/978-90-481-9719-4_4', '10.1093/jaac/kpab016', '10.1017/9781108992565', '10.1111/j.0966-8373.2005.00229.x', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac38.2.0167', '10.1017/CBO9780511804649', '10.1017/CBO9780511804656', '10.1017/CBO9781139028639', '10.1515/kant-2018-0002', '10.1515/9783111341965', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac55.4.0387', '10.1017/CBO9780511487323']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Surely they know that the zombies are not real, and that they cannot really shoot them, but only control a fictional character who does so. Some philosophers of fiction argue that we need the concept of imaginative desires (or ‘i-desires’) to explain situations in which people feel desires towards fictional characters or desires that motivate pretend actions. Others claim that we can explain these situations without complicating human psychology with a novel mental state. Within their debates, however, these scholars exclusively focus on non-interactive fictions and children’s games of make-believe. In this paper, I argue that our experience of immersive, interactive fictions like videogames gives us cause to reappraise the concept of imaginative desires. Moreover, I describe how i-desires are a useful conceptual tool within videogame development and can shed new light on apparently immoral in-game actions.","[('Nele Van De Mosselaer', 'University of Antwerp')]",[],Oxford University Press (OUP)

I argue that we should reject this dichotomy.","[('Stacie Friend', '')]","['10.1111/papq.12294', '10.1093/aesthj/ayaa037', '10.1093/aesthj/ayu014', '10.1093/aesthj/ayw054', '10.4324/9781003469018-28', '10.1080/09515089.2016.1164306', '10.1093/oso/9780199656615.001.0001', '10.4324/9780203721742', '10.1111/jaac.12385', '10.1093/aesthj/ayaa010', '10.1111/j.1468-0114.2011.01407.x', '10.1093/oso/9780190096342.001.0001', '10.1093/aesthj/ayx033', '10.58519/aesthinv.v4i1.11925', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199756940.001.0001', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199647019.001.0001', '10.1111/j.1468-0017.2006.00286.x', '10.5040/9781350038950.ch-006', '10.1093/aristoteliansupp/49.1.67', '10.1017/S003181910005765X', '10.1093/aesthj/ayu004', '10.1093/aesthj/ayv041', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198790648.001.0001', '10.1016/j.actpsy.2016.02.003', '10.1111/jaac.12384', '10.1093/aesthj/ayr019', '10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669639.003.0011', '10.1093/aesthj/ayz015', '10.1093/aesthj/ayw003', '10.1093/aesthj/ayz049', '10.2307/2025831', '10.1111/jaac.12606', '10.1093/aesthj/ays031']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

10.1093/aesthj/ayac020,BRITISH JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Country music and the problem of authenticity,[],"AbstractIn the small but growing literature on the philosophy of country music, the question of how we ought to understand the genre’s notion of authenticity has emerged as one of the central questions. Many country music scholars argue that authenticity claims track attributions of cultural standing or artistic self-expression. However, careful attention to the history of the genre reveals that these claims are simply factually wrong. On the basis of this, we have grounds for dismissing these attributions. Here, I argue for an alternative model of authenticity in which we take claims about the relative authenticity of country music to be evidence of ‘country’ being a dual-character concept in the same way that it has been suggested of punk rock and hip-hop. Authentic country music is country music that embodies the core value commitments of the genre. These values form the basis of country artists’ and audiences’ practical identities. Part of country music’s aesthetic practice is that audiences reconnect with, reify, and revise this common practical identity through identification with artists and works that manifest these values. We should then think of authenticity discourse within country music as a kind of game within the genre’s practice of shaping and maintaining this practical identity.","[('Evan Malone', 'The University at Albany , USA')]","['10.1093/aesthj/ayz055', '10.5406/jamerfolk.127.504.0126', '10.1111/phc3.12729', '10.1080/03007760701682383', '10.1525/california/9780520280656.001.0001', '10.1016/j.cognition.2013.01.005', '10.1111/phpr.12727', '10.1080/03007769108591458', '10.1111/papq.12301', '10.1111/j.1460-2466.1999.tb02821.x', '10.1215/9780822397786-019', '10.7208/chicago/9780226111445.001.0001', '10.1215/9780822397786-014', '10.1111/phc3.12145', '10.2307/2182230', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac52.1.0127', '10.1111/1540_6245.jaac57.2.0221', '10.1007/BF01079504']",Oxford University Press (OUP)

Using a virtual reality headset, Kinect and projections, the installation explores the potential of immersive technology to create copresent experiences that foster intercorporeal relationships between immersants wearing a headset and those using the projections. Immersants’ bodies are at the center of the installation, activated as a site for social exchange. Body RemiXer has been exhibited at an art festival and at several smaller events. The authors’ observations during these exhibits reveal Body RemiXer's capacity to disrupt social norms and stimulate new connections.","[('John Desnoyers-Stewart', 'Simon Fraser University 250 - 13450 102 Ave Surrey, BC V3T 0A3, Canada'), ('Ekaterina R.

10.1162/leon_a_02105,LEONARDO,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory,"A Computational Study of Empty Space Ratios in Chinese Landscape Painting, 618-2011",[],"Abstract The use of empty space (ES) is ubiquitous in Asian art. The authors use a computational method to quantitatively assess the amount of ES in Chinese landscape painting (CLP). The data show that 56.8% of ancient CLPs contain mostly ES, while only 9.4% from modern times do. ES reached its peak during the Yuan dynasty (1271–-1368) and its lowest point in the 1960s. Chan culture, literati ink play, the “exhibition hall effect,” and Maoist politics, as well as other social factors, may have had an impact on this shift. This empirical study indicates that art keeps abreast of current developments: The philosophy, culture, politics and general education of a specific era influence artists’ perception, aesthetics and creative output.","[('Guoyan Wang', 'Guoyan Wang, Department of Digital Communication, Room 5146, Building 5, Dushu Lake Campus of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China.
