But what happens when history's bad guys are not Han? In parts of China's Northwest, the party identified Hui Muslim elites as the main agents of nationality exploitation and Tibetans as their principal targets. It therefore declared Tibetans of all classes to be victims of nationality exploitation and ordered that ""good"" Muslims be distinguished from ""bad,"" a task made more urgent by a string of uprisings that engulfed several Muslim-majority areas of the Qinghai-Gansu Highlands from 1949 to 1953. While echoes can be found in the late Qing state's response to Muslim rebellion, this article argues that the CCP's approach to the ""Hui question"" must be viewed as part of a particular practice of minoritization and a framework for conceptualizing the new socialist nation-state that would leave Muslims and other non-Han communities susceptible to majoritarian-state violence.","[('Benno Weiner', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6635438948869705}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.6505851984024048}, {""discipline"": ""0304 民族学"", ""score"": 0.5155957728624344}, {""discipline"": ""0307 中共党史党建学"", ""score"": 0.511644787589709}, {""discipline"": ""0305 马克思主义理论"", ""score"": 0.5102900683879852}]"

They were the predominant group of Chinese merchants trading in Japan from the ninth to eleventh centuries, and from approximately 850 to 1000, they were the only sea merchant group known to operate there. Not only were merchants from the Zhedong region instrumental in commercial and religious exchange between China and Japan, they were also adept at navigating through the many political upheavals of the Tang-Song transition. As such, their sudden decline at the end of the tenth century, in tandem with the rise of Fujian merchants in overseas trade, raises questions as to the nature of trade administration at this time. This article will consider the political implications of the rise and fall of merchant networks in Chinese history, as well as present new information that calls into question the idea that Japan was diplomatically isolated throughout the tenth century.","[('Gregory Sattler', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.5985503494739532}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.5969754974047342}, {""discipline"": ""0303 社会学"", ""score"": 0.582723718881607}, {""discipline"": ""0908 水产"", ""score"": 0.5068874150514603}, {""discipline"": ""0824 船舶与海洋工程"", ""score"": 0.5001636147499084}]"

This article addresses the question of women's work by reassessing the millennia-old ""men till and women weave"" trope, which asserted that farming (or the outer sphere it represented) was improper for women. It argues that, despite being marginalized or even eroticized in male-centered narratives, many women in Jiangnan China's economic and cultural center sweated in the fields and swiftly shifted their tasks for the family or market needs. Specifically, men dominated the more lucrative, more recognizable, and, in many cases, less arduous tasks in rice cultivation, while women significantly contributed to other tasks in the rice paddies and dominated cotton farming. Such a gender division of labor was affected less by biological factors or gender norms than by a combination of the physical property of crops (especially if the crop invites animal traction), the labor market, and a constantly evolving gendered narrative. In addition to self-conscious scholarly records of the gendered labor regime, much of the research relies on an original use of 891 criminal cases in the First Historical Archives (aka xingke tiben) to approach rural work patterns and the digital humanities methods to analyze and visualize the cases that serve as random samples of the crop regimes and everyday activities of rural men and women.","[('You Wang', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6651728312174479}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.659105137983958}, {""discipline"": ""1203 农林经济管理"", ""score"": 0.5251155485709508}, {""discipline"": ""0601 考古学"", ""score"": 0.5190208425124486}, {""discipline"": ""0821 纺织科学与工程"", ""score"": 0.5167714099089304}]"

This article examines the intellectual agenda shared by their works aimed at rediscovering Chang'an, and argues that, instead of the monumental structures and imperial ideology of the early and high Tang, Song literati-officials were more interested in either pre-Tang objects and structures still extant in Chang'an or the literary relics in the south of the city from the post-An Lushan era.","[('Xin Wen', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.5974848926067352}, {""discipline"": ""0303 社会学"", ""score"": 0.588647872209549}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.5872697750727336}, {""discipline"": ""0601 考古学"", ""score"": 0.504223608970642}, {""discipline"": ""0501 中国语言文学"", ""score"": 0.49619336823622384}]"

Amid active policy discussions of the guolu problem, the Qing state first added a guolu substatute to the Qing Code in 1758 and later tried to eliminate guolu as a statutory category after a large incident in 1781. This article traces the trajectory of the statutory category of guolu and analyzes how the Qing state's strategy of managing underclass migrants in Sichuan transformed during the eighteenth century. In particular, this article contextualizes the legislative and policy turns within the socioeconomic impacts of the two Jinchuan Wars (1747&lt;en&gt;1749; 1771&lt;en&gt;1776), which significantly reshaped the scale of underclass mobility in Sichuan and scholar-officials' perceptions of underclass migrants. Influenced by the labor-intensive military supply and the socioeconomic impacts of warfare, the Qing state's policies on guolu criminality and underclass mobility transformed from the exclusion of targeted groups to the accommodation of nonagrarian means of livelihood and networks. The case of guolu suggests that the eighteenth-century Qing state was also developing policies of cooption and mobilization, in addition to statutory vilification, to tackle the quickly expanding scale of underclass mobility. Through this case, this article calls attention to the military perspective as a key to understanding the interactions among underclass criminality, judicial discourse, and bureaucratic process in Qing China.","[('Yiying Pan', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6585357586542765}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.6513794700304667}, {""discipline"": ""0306 公安学"", ""score"": 0.5154458045959474}, {""discipline"": ""0301 法学"", ""score"": 0.5112549155950545}, {""discipline"": ""0303 社会学"", ""score"": 0.507584830125173}]"

The concept of epidemic qi offers a unique cognitive model with which to approach the epidemic risk in a given socio-historical environment that differs from a linear analysis of the “chain of infection” in modern medicine. The paper concludes that the plague theories reflected in TCM are relevant to the contemporary understanding of risk control during a public health crisis.","[('國斌 程', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6611799816290538}, {""discipline"": ""0712 科学技术史"", ""score"": 0.6589760839939117}, {""discipline"": ""1005 中医学"", ""score"": 0.5495969921350479}, {""discipline"": ""1004 公共卫生与预防医学"", ""score"": 0.5466649333635967}, {""discipline"": ""1006 中西医结合"", ""score"": 0.54280832807223}]"

As domestic politics shifted, anti-foreign sentiments increased, with Han literati expressing intertwined resentments toward Christianity, Tibetan Buddhism, and Manchu rule. These issues were often entangled and carefully discussed under Qing censorship. While initially subtle, these anti-foreign feelings surfaced in works like the novel Yesou puyan , reflecting growing dissatisfaction with foreign elements and foreshadowing the rise of anti-Manchu sentiments near the end of the Qing dynasty.","[('Wonmook Kang', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6548175364732742}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.645758060614268}, {""discipline"": ""0502 外国语言文学"", ""score"": 0.5077656259139378}, {""discipline"": ""0101 哲学"", ""score"": 0.5066795309384664}, {""discipline"": ""0501 中国语言文学"", ""score"": 0.5044477860132853}]"

Prior to the Song dynasty, the poetic depiction of grotto-heavens had largely remained a marginal trope, with the few poems extant on this topic portraying the cavern spaces as alien and forbidden. However, Song literati displayed a newfound interest in celebrating grotto-heavens through their poetry. Using a poetry collection dedicated to the Grand Cleanse Grotto-heaven as a representative case, this article demonstrates that Song poets reimagined the enigmatic Daoist grottos as landscapes accessible to secular literati. Their literary reimagination of grotto-heavens as accessible places illuminates literati attempts to expand their knowledge by drawing inspiration from Daoist treatises, the legacies of earlier literary paragons, and their personal experiences visiting grotto-heaven landscapes.","[('Li Wanmeng', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.5813820650180181}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.5755372087160746}, {""discipline"": ""0303 社会学"", ""score"": 0.5725531637668609}, {""discipline"": ""0704 天文学"", ""score"": 0.5022397935390472}, {""discipline"": ""0601 考古学"", ""score"": 0.49415755271911616}]"

For Chan monks, it analogously represented the transmission of unspoken teachings and the urgency of transcending intellection and language. Simultaneously, Song literati wove the stringless qin into diverse narratives, reflecting both their philosophical explorations and Tao Qian’s influence.

The young regime had just embarked on its First Five-Year Plan, aimed at achieving rapid economic development and industrialization. The flood swept across several provinces, displaced populations, and submerged farmlands, posing both a new challenge and an opportunity for the regime to shape the socioeconomic landscape of the affected regions. This article uses a localized perspective to examine how the rural society of Hubei Province, the hardest-hit area, responded to the disaster. The central government’s self-help doctrine delegated much power to local governments and communities. Local officials and rural cadres had considerable leeway in managing the relief campaign as they simultaneously followed the state macroeconomic policy of rural collectivization. The 1954 flood in Hubei Province serves as a case study that illustrates the complexities of disaster management in the early years of the PRC.","[('Yue Liang', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6532818228006363}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.6368223786354066}, {""discipline"": ""0833 城乡规划学"", ""score"": 0.5072545876105626}, {""discipline"": ""0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学"", ""score"": 0.504847718278567}, {""discipline"": ""0903 农业资源与环境"", ""score"": 0.5035870840152105}]"

Contrary to the prevalent idea that the ceremony was a long-standing tradition, I argue that it was meticulously designed by Nurhaci to ensure a smooth succession after his passing. Thus, the ceremony was entangled with consolidating the polity and its rulership from its inception. The ceremony underwent several alterations as the Jurchen khanate evovled into the Qing empire and moved south. In the 1670s, the Kangxi emperor transformed Tangse into an exclusive imperial shrine for the banner elites, as the court sought to end threats from Han Chinese warlords, further signified the emergence of a new ruling discourse: the prerequisite to claim Manchuness rested on the privileged banner status. This policy institutionalized the conflation of Manchu identity with banner affiliation. The transformation of the New Year Tangse ceremony from a court ritual, to an imperial rite, then to a state rite, and to a Manchu rite underscores the instrumental religious symbolism that Qing rulers relied on in times of struggles.","[('Julia Manchu Wu', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.648642341295878}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.6353536049524943}, {""discipline"": ""0601 考古学"", ""score"": 0.4962813367446263}, {""discipline"": ""0301 法学"", ""score"": 0.4944310635328293}, {""discipline"": ""1005 中医学"", ""score"": 0.49404457608858743}]"

Drawing on ancient practices of fasting and Mahāyāna Buddhist dietary rules, this vegetarianism quickly evolved into a widely accepted form of moral self-cultivation in many religious contexts, one that was intrinsically related to morality, self-actualization, notions of karma and retribution, and ritual purity. Since the late nineteenth century, the impacts of increasing transnational entanglements, new ideas, and changing food practices have subtly transformed this tradition: these transformations include an engagement with global animal protection movements in the wake of the First World War and contemporary attempts to integrate concerns about global warming, food safety, and environmentalism into the discourse. By looking at three specific cases, the special issue traces the persistence and evolution of vegetarian concepts and practices in Chinese societies from the late imperial period until today.","[('Nikolas Broy', ''), ('Matthias Schumann', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6796092659235001}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.6598196625709534}, {""discipline"": ""0905 畜牧学"", ""score"": 0.5277588466803232}, {""discipline"": ""1005 中医学"", ""score"": 0.5265347937742868}, {""discipline"": ""1004 公共卫生与预防医学"", ""score"": 0.5230320215225219}]"

Portrayals of his grandmother Dagi likewise exemplify how political agency asserted by women in ruling circles is typically decried as wasteful, inappropriate, or as an immoral interference in government. Yet its institutionalization in the Mongol-Yuan government, especially in the empress dowagers' office, demonstrates that the official and unofficial networks of royal women were important channels through which Mongolian imperial sovereignty was constructed and negotiated, increasingly in tension with the Daidu bureaucracy and a throne seeking to centralize power in its own hands.","[('Ruth W.

This article argues that the events of the uprising have to be read in the light of disunified local gangs who had turf to protect, their interest in obtaining arms from the revolutionaries, and a very tense political situation that might indeed have evolved out of contact between revolutionaries and the gangs. However, the significance of the incident was magnified because of the proximity of the location to the high-profile Pingxiang Coal Mine in Jiangxi.

Based on newly available local archives, this case study of class division during land reform in the suburbs of Beijing argues that the making of ""evil tyrant landlords""—and the struggle against them—played a decisive role in conceptualizing the ""landlord"" as both a figure of Marxist economic exploitation and the morally stigmatized rural elite during land reform and the building of the party-state. After the collapse of the existing rural ruling class, the ""struggle against tyrants"" movement immediately turned toward enacting formal class division. As a consequence, the discourse of class struggle based on a clear-cut landlord-peasantry dichotomy was, unsurprisingly, allowed by the CCP to infiltrate rural China's post-1949 political culture.","[('Shaofan An', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6563174873590469}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.6406627535820008}, {""discipline"": ""0833 城乡规划学"", ""score"": 0.5138880958159765}, {""discipline"": ""1203 农林经济管理"", ""score"": 0.5093528161446254}, {""discipline"": ""0302 政治学"", ""score"": 0.5079043984413147}]"

I argue that the antireligious movement in Wenzhou during the Great Leap Forward was not a central initiative. Instead, what happened was that local state agents seized the opportunity offered by the Great Leap Forward to crush religious communities, especially Christian communities, with which they had long had tensions.

Engaging with Buddhists and animal protection activists from around the world, she aimed to spread a more positive image of Chinese Pure Land Buddhism, which was marginalized in international discourses of the time.

However, the resounding emphasis of this work has been ministerial receptivity to international law. This article argues for the importance of taking a broader perspective, elucidating a concurrent transformation in ministerial attitudes towards achieving rhetorical and oratorical sophistication in their diplomacy. To illustrate this shift, I use the career of Halliday Macartney, a Scotsman who served at the Qing London legation from 1877 to 1905, as a conduit. Initially responsible for interpretation and cultural explication, Macartney’s role evolved in the 1880s to become the legation’s lead rhetorician and negotiator. I argue that rather than constitute an instantiation of ministerial ineptitude, the ministers’ recalibration of Macartney’s remit was an important indication of their commitment to achieving rhetorical and oratorical sophistication in their diplomacy. Furthermore, I make the case that we need to understand Macartney’s position in the legation in line with the yamen culture of outsourcing technical work to muyou . In doing so, I argue that the ministers drew upon aspects of their own bureaucratic culture in order to meet the challenges posed by this foreign diplomatic culture.","[('Thomas P.

Unlike most studies on the Eight Banners, which look from an imperial perspective, this study shifts the focus from the Manchu ruling house to the Han subjects, who were mostly bondservants in pre-conquest Qing times. Despite their servitude, these Han subjects, fully aware of the Qing’s need for the artillery knowledge they possessed, actively negotiated with the Qing court for socio-political privileges. This decade-long negotiation, centered around artillery technology, eventually led to the creation of the Hanjun Eight Banners. The negotiation approach highlights the historical agency of the subjugated ethnic group and demonstrates the extent and the limits of state power in devising its ethnic policies. It challenges the conventional notion that the Qing tactfully exploited ethnic differences to rule its vast and diverse subjects. It also demonstrates that the Qing’s flexibility in negotiating and compromising with different ethnic groups was key to its rapid rise in the seventeenth century.","[('Yan Hon Michael Chung', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6676390091578166}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.65015895764033}, {""discipline"": ""1407 区域国别学"", ""score"": 0.5188534865776697}, {""discipline"": ""0601 考古学"", ""score"": 0.5175987710555394}, {""discipline"": ""1102 战略学"", ""score"": 0.5097710400819778}]"

Using Chinese, Russian, English and Japanese primary sources, this article examines the formation of the Tanghe huifang, a prominent huifang in the Mt. Changbai area, and its tumultuous relations with the Qing state from 1880 1910. The central argument of the article is that the huifang was an autonomous polity a mini-state of sorts organized by hunter-gatherers (primarily Han Chinese migrants from Shandong), and based on the utilization of forest resources such as deer antlers, medicinal herbs, gold, and most importantly, ginseng plantations. The huifang protected the community from the threat of bandits, taxed the forest industries, regulated trade, and protected the forest resources from destruction, if only on a limited scale. Initially unofficially managed by the Jilin military authority, the huifang collided with the Qing state in the 1880s 1890s and finally revolted against the state in 1897 when the state opened the mountain forests for agrarian development—known as the ""Opening the wasteland"" (fanghuang) policy. Unable to subdue the resistance, the Qing state decided to incorporate the mountain polity into its political domain, accommodating the huifang as the government's police force and its leaders as the police heads in 1908. This article qualifies the current scholarship that examines the politics of the Chinese borderland primarily through the lens of the national and international politics—a lens that focuses on the top-down process of central state power and state-initiated agricultural and industrial development that took place in the context of growing imperialist expansion into the Qing frontier. Instead, this article highlights an alternative pattern of politics and economic transformation articulated from the bottom up, a pattern predicated on the decentralized utilization of the forest resources in Manchuria's mountains.","[('Kwangmin Kim', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.65110642015934}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.640093998114268}, {""discipline"": ""1203 农林经济管理"", ""score"": 0.5091081609328588}, {""discipline"": ""0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学"", ""score"": 0.5060526738564173}, {""discipline"": ""0601 考古学"", ""score"": 0.5057187428077061}]"

Even though abstention from meat and related food products is not a requirement for membership, devoted Yiguandao practitioners nevertheless value it as a hallmark of religious commitment and dedication. I argue that we can observe a clear shift in discourses on vegetarianism that is intimately related to the evolution of Yiguandao from a local religious group at the beginning of the twentieth century to a globalized movement in the early twenty-first century.

Though recent studies show that the Qing used other ruling traditions and methods in governing frontier and non-Chinese areas, negotiations and deliberations between inner and outer courts are still the classic model for understanding Qing emperors’ practices of power in Beijing. Upon analysis of Qing’s receptions of the papal legations, this article reveals that Qing emperors intentionally bypassed the bureaucratic system by using a private power network to practice their power in traditional Chinese areas. Qing rulers’ practices of private power have long been neglected because of the lack of official Qing chronicles and histories covering this part of Qing rulership. Benefited from Jesuits’ records, this article reconstructs the basic operation mechanism of Qing rulers’ private networks, and argues that their private networks were not an add-on or attachment but a structure parallel to the bureaucratic system. This parallel power structure utilized but not well documented in official Qing writings, is in fact an important character of Qing rulership differentiating the Qing from the Ming.","[('Litian Swen', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6577621132135392}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.643910280863444}, {""discipline"": ""0301 法学"", ""score"": 0.5013813704252243}, {""discipline"": ""1105 军队指挥学"", ""score"": 0.5013238469759623}, {""discipline"": ""0601 考古学"", ""score"": 0.5008437742789587}]"

Drawing upon the four fundamental principles of Confucian bioethics, namely “benevolence,” “justice,” “integrity,” and “harmony,” this paper examines the ethical challenges of safeguarding lives and health, ensuring a fair distribution of resources and wealth, obtaining accurate and reliable information, and openly sharing the costs and resources throughout this transformation in the PPC approach. By focusing on the key actors involved in the process, we propose that the shift from a government-centric to a collaborative “family + individual + government” approach is both necessary and sustainable. Accordingly, we advocate for accelerating the return to normal production and daily life to mitigate the societal “pain” associated with the transformation. Additionally, we urge the government to reflect on its previous experience and prepare for a possible pandemic recurrence.","[('丹蕾 陳', ''), ('靜嫻 吳', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6493124941984812}, {""discipline"": ""0712 科学技术史"", ""score"": 0.6427734911441803}, {""discipline"": ""1004 公共卫生与预防医学"", ""score"": 0.5288708726565043}, {""discipline"": ""1002 临床医学"", ""score"": 0.5274911294380824}, {""discipline"": ""1006 中西医结合"", ""score"": 0.5222787360350291}]"

While existing research has amply described specific aspects of suicide in the Qing law, especially among women commemorated in the ""chastity cult,"" this piece presents a more systematic view of suicide's legal definitions and common tropes in suicide cases. It also considers how the economic and cultural backdrop of the high Qing shaped elite men's suicides. How did officials' lives lead them to seek death by their own hands, how did their circumstances contrast to the suicidality of non-elite men and women, and how did their bureaucratic peers, superiors, and sovereigns regard their deaths?","[('Y.

Meanwhile, however, many local officials held different views. Not only were these crops a target for taxation in many places, but they were, after the early Qing, also seen as with great economic potential in cultivating the uplands, where limited water and fertile land made it difficult to grow wet rice widely. In addition, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries when maize cultivation made an allegedly destructive impact on the soil, officials ordered and made efforts to replace maize with these crops which were seen as causing less damage. Finally, towards the end of the Qing, local officials worked to provide financial and technological support for local residents to cultivate the upland area. In all, the shifting agricultural policies concerning cash crops in Southeast China refresh our understanding of agricultural and economic policy in late imperial China in general, which has been understood as focusing more on lowland production of rice, silk, and cotton.","[('Yiyun Peng', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6581981132427852}, {""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.6420417229334513}, {""discipline"": ""1203 农林经济管理"", ""score"": 0.5275176872809728}, {""discipline"": ""0903 农业资源与环境"", ""score"": 0.5228470643361409}, {""discipline"": ""0902 园艺学"", ""score"": 0.5144258081912995}]"

Although there have been many studies of Christian schools in China from the missionary perspective, we know much less about how Chinese women themselves made sense of the education they received at missionary schools. Based on a study of two elite mission schools for girls in Republican-era East China, this article explores how girls applied child-rearing practices, hygiene, and domestic education to the children whom they taught in the vicinities of their schools. Like their missionary educators before them, they carved out new roles for themselves by claiming authority to speak for a downtrodden ""other"": Chinese children. In doing so, missionary schoolgirls created new knowledge about Chinese childhood in the early twentieth century.","[('Jennifer Bond', '')]",[],"[{""discipline"": ""0603 世界史"", ""score"": 0.6653619289398194}, {""discipline"": ""0602 中国史"", ""score"": 0.6640376140673956}, {""discipline"": ""0401 教育学"", ""score"": 0.5234994679689406}, {""discipline"": ""0502 外国语言文学"", ""score"": 0.516502300898234}, {""discipline"": ""0303 社会学"", ""score"": 0.5151173243920009}]"
