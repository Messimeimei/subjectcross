10.3390/publications9010012,PUBLICATIONS,Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus: The Titans of Bibliographic Information in Today's Academic World,"Nowadays, the importance of bibliographic databases (DBs) has increased enormously, as they are the main providers of publication metadata and bibliometric indicators universally used both for research assessment practices and for performing daily tasks. Because the reliability of these tasks firstly depends on the data source, all users of the DBs should be able to choose the most suitable one. Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus are the two main bibliographic DBs. The comprehensive evaluation of the DBs’ coverage is practically impossible without extensive bibliometric analyses or literature reviews, but most DBs users do not have bibliometric competence and/or are not willing to invest additional time for such evaluations. Apart from that, the convenience of the DB’s interface, performance, provided impact indicators and additional tools may also influence the users’ choice. The main goal of this work is to provide all of the potential users with an all-inclusive description of the two main bibliographic DBs by gathering the findings that are presented in the most recent literature and information provided by the owners of the DBs at one place. This overview should aid all stakeholders employing publication and citation data in selecting the most suitable DB."

While this crisis has presented the U.S. healthcare delivery system with unprecedented challenges, the pandemic has catalyzed rapid adoption of telehealth, or the entire spectrum of activities used to deliver care at a distance. Using examples reported by U.S. healthcare organizations, including ours, we describe the role that telehealth has played in transforming healthcare delivery during the 3 phases of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic: (1) stay-at-home outpatient care, (2) initial COVID-19 hospital surge, and (3) postpandemic recovery. Within each of these 3 phases, we examine how people, process, and technology work together to support a successful telehealth transformation. Whether healthcare enterprises are ready or not, the new reality is that virtual care has arrived."

Between March 2nd and April 14th 2020, telemedicine visits increased from 102.4 daily to 801.6 daily. (683% increase) in urgent care after the system-wide expansion of virtual urgent care staff in response to COVID-19. Of all virtual visits post expansion, 56.2% and 17.6% urgent and nonurgent visits, respectively, were COVID-19–related. Telemedicine usage was highest by patients 20 to 44 years of age, particularly for urgent care. The COVID-19 pandemic has driven rapid expansion of telemedicine use for urgent care and nonurgent care visits beyond baseline periods. This reflects an important change in telemedicine that other institutions facing the COVID-19 pandemic should anticipate."

Since the last review of this resource in 2012, it has undergone several improvements. Most notable is the shift from a single SQL database to a series of linked databases tied to a framework of data called NameBank. This means that relations among data elements can be adjusted in more detail, resulting in expanded annotation of synonyms, the ability to flag names with specific nomenclatural properties, enhanced tracking of publications tied to names and improved annotation of scientific authorities and types. Additionally, practices utilized by NCBI Taxonomy curators specific to major taxonomic groups are described, terms peculiar to NCBI Taxonomy are explained, external resources are acknowledged and updates to tools and other resources are documented.Database URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy"
10.1093/database/baaa021,DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION,FerrDb: a manually curated resource for regulators and markers of ferroptosis and ferroptosis-disease associations,"Abstract Ferroptosis is a mode of regulated cell death that depends on iron. Cells die from the toxic accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species. Ferroptosis is tightly linked to a variety of human diseases, such as cancers and degenerative diseases. The ferroptotic process is complicated and consists of a wide range of metabolites and biomolecules. Although great progress has been achieved, the mechanism of ferroptosis remains enigmatic. We have currently entered an era of extensive knowledge advancement, and thus, it is important to find ways to organize and utilize data efficiently. We have observed a high-quality knowledge base of ferroptosis research is lacking. In this study, we downloaded 784 ferroptosis articles from the PubMed database. Ferroptosis regulators and markers and associated diseases were extracted from these articles and annotated. In summary, 253 regulators (including 108 drivers, 69 suppressors, 35 inducers and 41 inhibitors), 111 markers and 95 ferroptosis-disease associations were found. We then developed FerrDb, the first manually curated database for regulators and markers of ferroptosis and ferroptosis-disease associations. The database has a user-friendly interface, and it will be updated every 6 months to offer long-term service. FerrDb is expected to help researchers acquire insights into ferroptosis.

There are more than 400 different types of PTMs affecting many aspects of protein functions. Such modifications happen as crucial molecular regulatory mechanisms to regulate diverse cellular processes. These processes have a significant impact on the structure and function of proteins. Disruption in PTMs can lead to the dysfunction of vital biological processes and hence to various diseases. High-throughput experimental methods for discovery of PTMs are very laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need for computational methods and powerful tools to predict PTMs. There are vast amounts of PTMs data, which are publicly accessible through many online databases. In this survey, we comprehensively reviewed the major online databases and related tools. The current challenges of computational methods were reviewed in detail as well."

Going forth, reconciling such tensions between machine agency and human agency will be important in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), as machines get more agentic and media experiences become increasingly determined by algorithms. Theory and research should be geared toward a deeper understanding of the human experience of algorithms in general and the psychology of Human–AI interaction (HAII) in particular. This article proposes some directions by applying the dual-process framework of the Theory of Interactive Media Effects (TIME) for studying the symbolic and enabling effects of the affordances of AI-driven media on user perceptions and experiences."

10.1093/jamia/ocz192,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,A governance model for the application of AI in health care,"AbstractAs the efficacy of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving aspects of healthcare delivery is increasingly becoming evident, it becomes likely that AI will be incorporated in routine clinical care in the near future. This promise has led to growing focus and investment in AI medical applications both from governmental organizations and technological companies. However, concern has been expressed about the ethical and regulatory aspects of the application of AI in health care. These concerns include the possibility of biases, lack of transparency with certain AI algorithms, privacy concerns with the data used for training AI models, and safety and liability issues with AI application in clinical environments. While there has been extensive discussion about the ethics of AI in health care, there has been little dialogue or recommendations as to how to practically address these concerns in health care. In this article, we propose a governance model that aims to not only address the ethical and regulatory issues that arise out of the application of AI in health care, but also stimulate further discussion about governance of AI in health care."
10.1093/jamia/ocaa196,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,"The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C): Rationale, design, infrastructure, and deployment","AbstractObjectiveCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses societal challenges that require expeditious data and knowledge sharing. Though organizational clinical data are abundant, these are largely inaccessible to outside researchers. Statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. Here, we introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from many centers.Materials and MethodsThe Clinical and Translational Science Award Program and scientific community created N3C to overcome technical, regulatory, policy, and governance barriers to sharing and harmonizing individual-level clinical data. We developed solutions to extract, aggregate, and harmonize data across organizations and data models, and created a secure data enclave to enable efficient, transparent, and reproducible collaborative analytics.ResultsOrganized in inclusive workstreams, we created legal agreements and governance for organizations and researchers; data extraction scripts to identify and ingest positive, negative, and possible COVID-19 cases; a data quality assurance and harmonization pipeline to create a single harmonized dataset; population of the secure data enclave with data, machine learning, and statistical analytics tools; dissemination mechanisms; and a synthetic data pilot to democratize data access.ConclusionsThe N3C has demonstrated that a multisite collaborative learning health network can overcome barriers to rapidly build a scalable infrastructure incorporating multiorganizational clinical data for COVID-19 analytics. We expect this effort to save lives by enabling rapid collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and data scientists to identify treatments and specialized care and thereby reduce the immediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19."
10.1093/database/baaa010,DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION,Artificial intelligence with multi-functional machine learning platform development for better healthcare and precision medicine,"AbstractPrecision medicine is one of the recent and powerful developments in medical care, which has the potential to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice of medicine, allowing earlier interventions using advanced diagnostics and tailoring better and economically personalized treatments. Identifying the best pathway to personalized and population medicine involves the ability to analyze comprehensive patient information together with broader aspects to monitor and distinguish between sick and relatively healthy people, which will lead to a better understanding of biological indicators that can signal shifts in health. While the complexities of disease at the individual level have made it difficult to utilize healthcare information in clinical decision-making, some of the existing constraints have been greatly minimized by technological advancements. To implement effective precision medicine with enhanced ability to positively impact patient outcomes and provide real-time decision support, it is important to harness the power of electronic health records by integrating disparate data sources and discovering patient-specific patterns of disease progression. Useful analytic tools, technologies, databases, and approaches are required to augment networking and interoperability of clinical, laboratory and public health systems, as well as addressing ethical and social issues related to the privacy and protection of healthcare data with effective balance. Developing multifunctional machine learning platforms for clinical data extraction, aggregation, management and analysis can support clinicians by efficiently stratifying subjects to understand specific scenarios and optimize decision-making. Implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare is a compelling vision that has the potential in leading to the significant improvements for achieving the goals of providing real-time, better personalized and population medicine at lower costs. In this study, we focused on analyzing and discussing various published artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions, approaches and perspectives, aiming to advance academic solutions in paving the way for a new data-centric era of discovery in healthcare."

Database development and biocuration are the prerequisites for the reuse of these big data. Here, relying on China National GeneBank (CNGB), we present CNGB Sequence Archive (CNSA) for archiving omics data, including raw sequencing data and its further analyzed results which are organized into six objects, namely Project, Sample, Experiment, Run, Assembly and Variation at present. Moreover, CNSA has created a correlation model of living samples, sample information and analytical data on some projects. Both living samples and analytical data are directly correlated with the sample information. From either one, information or data of the other two can be obtained, so that all data can be traced throughout the life cycle from the living sample to the sample information to the analytical data. Complying with the data standards commonly used in the life sciences, CNSA is committed to building a comprehensive and curated data repository for storing, managing and sharing of omics data. We will continue to improve the data standards and provide free access to open-data resources for worldwide scientific communities to support academic research and the bio-industry.

10.1111/hir.12320,HEALTH INFORMATION AND LIBRARIES JOURNAL,An exploration of how fake news is taking over social media and putting public health at risk,"AbstractRecent statistics show that almost 1/4 of a million people have died and four million people are affected either with mild or serious health problems caused by coronavirus (COVID‐19). These numbers are rapidly increasing (World Health Organization, May 3, 2020c). There is much concern during this pandemic about the spread of misleading or inaccurate information. This article reports on a small study which attempted to identify the types and sources of COVID‐19 misinformation. The authors identified and analysed 1225 pieces of COVID‐19 fake news stories taken from fact‐checkers, myth‐busters and COVID‐19 dashboards. The study is significant given the concern raised by the WHO Director‐General that ‘we are not just fighting the pandemic, we are also fighting infodemic’. The study concludes that the COVID‐19 infodemic is full of false claims, half backed conspiracy theories and pseudoscientific therapies, regarding the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, origin and spread of the virus. Fake news is pervasive in social media, putting public health at risk. The scale of the crisis and ubiquity of the misleading information require that scientists, health information professionals and journalists exercise their professional responsibility to help the general public identify fake news stories. They should ensure that accurate information is published and disseminated.J.M."
10.1093/jamia/ocz200,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Deep learning in clinical natural language processing: a methodical review,"AbstractObjectiveThis article methodically reviews the literature on deep learning (DL) for natural language processing (NLP) in the clinical domain, providing quantitative analysis to answer 3 research questions concerning methods, scope, and context of current research.Materials and MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics Anthology for articles using DL-based approaches to NLP problems in electronic health records. After screening 1,737 articles, we collected data on 25 variables across 212 papers.ResultsDL in clinical NLP publications more than doubled each year, through 2018. Recurrent neural networks (60.8%) and word2vec embeddings (74.1%) were the most popular methods; the information extraction tasks of text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction were dominant (89.2%). However, there was a “long tail” of other methods and specific tasks. Most contributions were methodological variants or applications, but 20.8% were new methods of some kind. The earliest adopters were in the NLP community, but the medical informatics community was the most prolific.DiscussionOur analysis shows growing acceptance of deep learning as a baseline for NLP research, and of DL-based NLP in the medical community. A number of common associations were substantiated (eg, the preference of recurrent neural networks for sequence-labeling named entity recognition), while others were surprisingly nuanced (eg, the scarcity of French language clinical NLP with deep learning).ConclusionDeep learning has not yet fully penetrated clinical NLP and is growing rapidly. This review highlighted both the popular and unique trends in this active field."
10.1093/jamia/ocaa037,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Rapid response to COVID-19: health informatics support for outbreak management in an academic health system,"Abstract Objective To describe the implementation of technological support important for optimizing clinical management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods Our health system has confirmed prior and current cases of COVID-19. An Incident Command Center was established early in the crisis and helped identify electronic health record (EHR)-based tools to support clinical care. Results We outline the design and implementation of EHR-based rapid screening processes, laboratory testing, clinical decision support, reporting tools, and patient-facing technology related to COVID-19. Discussion The EHR is a useful tool to enable rapid deployment of standardized processes. UC San Diego Health built multiple COVID-19-specific tools to support outbreak management, including scripted triaging, electronic check-in, standard ordering and documentation, secure messaging, real-time data analytics, and telemedicine capabilities. Challenges included the need to frequently adjust build to meet rapidly evolving requirements, communication, and adoption, and to coordinate the needs of multiple stakeholders while maintaining high-quality, prepandemic medical care. Conclusion The EHR is an essential tool in supporting the clinical needs of a health system managing the COVID-19 pandemic."
10.1093/jamia/ocz228,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,A tutorial on calibration measurements and calibration models for clinical prediction models,"AbstractOur primary objective is to provide the clinical informatics community with an introductory tutorial on calibration measurements and calibration models for predictive models using existing R packages and custom implemented code in R on real and simulated data. Clinical predictive model performance is commonly published based on discrimination measures, but use of models for individualized predictions requires adequate model calibration. This tutorial is intended for clinical researchers who want to evaluate predictive models in terms of their applicability to a particular population. It is also for informaticians and for software engineers who want to understand the role that calibration plays in the evaluation of a clinical predictive model, and to provide them with a solid starting point to consider incorporating calibration evaluation and calibration models in their work.Covered topics include (1) an introduction to the importance of calibration in the clinical setting, (2) an illustration of the distinct roles that discrimination and calibration play in the assessment of clinical predictive models, (3) a tutorial and demonstration of selected calibration measurements, (4) a tutorial and demonstration of selected calibration models, and (5) a brief discussion of limitations of these methods and practical suggestions on how to use them in practice."
10.25300/MISQ/2020/14818,MIS QUARTERLY,THE BRIGHT AND DARK SIDES OF TECHNOSTRESS: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY INVOLVING HEALTHCARE IT,"Today’s healthcare workers, specifically nurses, are experiencing technostress associated with the use of healthcare information technology (HIT). Technostress is often characterized by IS researchers as negative, or as being on the “dark side” of technology. However, a broader reading of the stress literature suggests that technostress may be both positive and negative, and can therefore have a “bright side” in addition to a dark side. The objective of this study is to conceptualize a holistic technostress process that includes positive and negative components of technostress embedded in two subprocesses: the techno-eustress subprocess and the techno-distress subprocess, respectively. The study instantiates this holistic technostress model through a sequential mixed-methods research design in the context of HIT. Phase 1 of the design is a qualitative, interpretive case study involving interviews with 32 nurses. Based on the findings from the case study, the paper builds a research model that operationalizes the concepts embedded in the holistic technostress model and identifies contextually relevant challenge and hindrance technostressors and outcomes. In Phase 2, the research model is empirically validated by analyzing survey data collected from 402 nurses employed in the United States. Results reveal that several challenge and hindrance technostressors are related to positive and negative psychological responses, respectively, and that such responses are related to job satisfaction and attrition, which impact turnover intention. Contributions to theory and practice are also discussed."
10.1093/jamia/ocaa156,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Telehealth in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Implications for rural health disparities,"Abstract Telehealth programs have long held promise for addressing rural health disparities perpetuated by inadequate healthcare access. The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and accompanying social distancing measures have hastened the implementation of telehealth programs in hospital systems around the globe. Here, we provide specific examples of telehealth efforts that have been implemented in a large rural healthcare system in response to the pandemic, and further describe how the massive shift to telehealth and reliance on virtual connections in these times of social isolation may impact rural health disparities for those without access to necessary broadband to deploy digital technologies. Finally, we provide recommendations for researchers and policymakers to ensure that telehealth initiatives do not amplify existing health disparities experienced by those living in rural communities."
10.1111/isj.12326,INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL,Digital platforms for development: Foundations and research agenda,"AbstractDigital platforms hold a central position in today's world economy and are said to offer a great potential for the economies and societies in the global South. Yet, to date, the scholarly literature on digital platforms has largely concentrated on business while their developmental implications remain understudied. In part, this is because digital platforms are a challenging research object due to their lack of conceptual definition, their spread across different regions and industries, and their intertwined nature with institutions, actors and digital technologies. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the ongoing debate in information systems and ICT4D research to understand what digital platforms meanfordevelopment. To do so, we first define what digital platforms are and differentiate between transaction and innovation platforms, and explain their key characteristics in terms of purpose, research foundations, material properties and business models. We add the socio‐technical context digital platforms operate and the linkages to developmental outcomes. We then conduct an extensive review to explore what current areas, developmental goals, tensions and issues emerge in the literature on platforms and development and identify relevant gaps in our knowledge. We later elaborate on six research questions to advance the studies on digital platforms for development: on indigenous innovation, digital platforms and institutions, on exacerbation of inequalities, on alternative forms of value, on the dark side of platforms and on the applicability of the platform typology for development."
10.1093/jamia/ocaa088,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,MINIMAR (MINimum Information for Medical Al Reporting): Developing reporting standards for artificial intelligence in health care,"Abstract The rise of digital data and computing power have contributed to significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), leading to the use of classification and prediction models in health care to enhance clinical decision-making for diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. However, such advances are limited by the lack of reporting standards for the data used to develop those models, the model architecture, and the model evaluation and validation processes. Here, we present MINIMAR (MINimum Information for Medical AI Reporting), a proposal describing the minimum information necessary to understand intended predictions, target populations, and hidden biases, and the ability to generalize these emerging technologies. We call for a standard to accurately and responsibly report on AI in health care. This will facilitate the design and implementation of these models and promote the development and use of associated clinical decision support tools, as well as manage concerns regarding accuracy and bias."
10.1093/jamia/ocz220,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Electronic health records and burnout: Time spent on the electronic health record after hours and message volume associated with exhaustion but not with cynicism among primary care clinicians,"AbstractObjectivesThe study sought to determine whether objective measures of electronic health record (EHR) use—related to time, volume of work, and proficiency—are associated with either or both components of clinician burnout: exhaustion and cynicism.Materials and MethodsWe combined Maslach Burnout Inventory survey measures (94% response rate; 122 of 130 clinicians) with objective, vendor-defined EHR use measures from log files (time after hours on clinic days; time on nonclinic days; message volume; composite measures of efficiency and proficiency). Data were collected in early 2018 from all primary care clinics of a large, urban, academic medical center. Multivariate regression models measured the association between each burnout component and each EHR use measure.ResultsOne-third (34%) of clinicians had high cynicism and 51% had high emotional exhaustion. Clinicians in the top 2 quartiles of EHR time after hours on scheduled clinic days (those above the sample median of 68 minutes per clinical full-time equivalent per week) had 4.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-20.1; P = .04) and 12.52 (95% CI, 2.6-61; P = .002) greater odds of high exhaustion. Clinicians in the top quartile of message volume (&amp;gt;307 messages per clinical full-time equivalent per week) had 6.17 greater odds of high exhaustion (95% CI, 1.1-41; P = .04). No measures were associated with high cynicism.DiscussionEHRs have been cited as a contributor to clinician burnout, and self-reported data suggest a relationship between EHR use and burnout. As organizations increasingly rely on objective, vendor-defined EHR measures to design and evaluate interventions to reduce burnout, our findings point to the measures that should be targeted.ConclusionsTwo specific EHR use measures were associated with exhaustion."
10.25300/MISQ/2021/15333,MIS QUARTERLY,ALGORITHMIC MANAGEMENT OF WORK ON ONLINE LABOR PLATFORMS: WHEN MATCHING MEETS CONTROL,"Online labor platforms (OLPs) can use algorithms along two dimensions: matching and control. While previous research has paid considerable attention to how OLPs optimize matching and accommodate market needs, OLPs can also employ algorithms to monitor and tightly control platform work. In this paper, we examine the nature of platform work on OLPs, and the role of algorithmic management in organizing how such work is conducted. Using a qualitative study of Uber drivers’ perceptions, supplemented by interviews with Uber executives and engineers, we present a grounded theory that captures the algorithmic management of work on OLPs. In the context of both algorithmic matching and algorithmic control, platform workers experience tensions relating to work execution, compensation, and belonging. We show that these tensions trigger market-like and organization-like response behaviors by platform workers. Our research contributes to the emerging literature on OLPs."
10.1093/jamia/ocaa217,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Telemedicine and healthcare disparities: a cohort study in a large healthcare system in New York City during COVID-19,"Abstract Objective Through the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telemedicine became a necessary entry point into the process of diagnosis, triage, and treatment. Racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare have been well documented in COVID-19 with respect to risk of infection and in-hospital outcomes once admitted, and here we assess disparities in those who access healthcare via telemedicine for COVID-19. Materials and Methods Electronic health record data of patients at New York University Langone Health between March 19th and April 30, 2020 were used to conduct descriptive and multilevel regression analyses with respect to visit type (telemedicine or in-person), suspected COVID diagnosis, and COVID test results. Results Controlling for individual and community-level attributes, Black patients had 0.6 times the adjusted odds (95% CI: 0.58–0.63) of accessing care through telemedicine compared to white patients, though they are increasingly accessing telemedicine for urgent care, driven by a younger and female population. COVID diagnoses were significantly more likely for Black versus white telemedicine patients. Discussion There are disparities for Black patients accessing telemedicine, however increased uptake by young, female Black patients. Mean income and decreased mean household size of a zip code were also significantly related to telemedicine use. Conclusion Telemedicine access disparities reflect those in in-person healthcare access. Roots of disparate use are complex and reflect individual, community, and structural factors, including their intersection—many of which are due to systemic racism. Evidence regarding disparities that manifest through telemedicine can be used to inform tool design and systemic efforts to promote digital health equity."
10.25300/MISQ/2021/15882,MIS QUARTERLY,THE NEXT GENERATION OF RESEARCH ON IS USE: A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF DELEGATION TO AND FROM AGENTIC IS ARTIFACTS,"Information systems (IS) use, the dominant theoretical paradigm for explaining how users apply IS artifacts toward goal attainment, gives primacy to human agency in the user–IS artifact relationship. Models and theorizing in the IS use research stream tend to treat the IS artifact as a passive tool; lacking in the ability to initiate action and accept rights and responsibilities for achieving optimal outcomes under uncertainty. We argue that a new generation of “agentic” IS artifacts requires revisiting the human agency primacy assumption. Agentic IS artifacts are no longer passive tools waiting to be used, are no longer always subordinate to the human agent, and can now assume responsibility for tasks with ambiguous requirements and for seeking optimal outcomes under uncertainty. To move our theorizing forward, we introduce delegation, based on agent interaction theories, as a foundational and powerful lens through which to understand and explain the human– agentic IS artifact relationship. While delegation has always been central to human–IS artifact interactions, it has yet to be explicitly recognized in IS use theorizing. We explicitly theorize IS delegation by developing an IS delegation theoretical framework. This framework provides a scaffolding which can guide future IS delegation theorizing and focuses on the human–agentic IS artifact dyad as the elemental unit of analysis. The framework specifically reveals the importance of agent attributes relevant to delegation (endowments, preferences, and roles) as well as foundational mechanisms of delegation (appraisal, distribution, and coordination). Guidelines are proposed to demonstrate how this theoretical framework can be applied toward generation of testable models. We conclude by outlining a roadmap for mobilizing future research."

We suggest this classical view is increasingly obsolete: digital technologies are now creating and shaping physical reality. We call this phenomenon the ontological reversal. The ontological reversal is where the digital version is created first, and the physical version second (if needed). This ontological reversal challenges us to think about the role of humans and technology in society. It also challenges us to think about our role as IS scholars in this digital world and what it means for our research agendas."
10.1093/jcmc/zmz022,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,"AI-Mediated Communication: Definition, Research Agenda, and Ethical Considerations","Abstract We define Artificial Intelligence-Mediated Communication (AI-MC) as interpersonal communication in which an intelligent agent operates on behalf of a communicator by modifying, augmenting, or generating messages to accomplish communication goals. The recent advent of AI-MC raises new questions about how technology may shape human communication and requires re-evaluation – and potentially expansion – of many of Computer-Mediated Communication’s (CMC) key theories, frameworks, and findings. A research agenda around AI-MC should consider the design of these technologies and the psychological, linguistic, relational, policy and ethical implications of introducing AI into human–human communication.

However, in the absence of explicit guidelines for how to use QCA for theory development, the popularity and proliferation of QCA possibly amplifies the risk of using QCA in an atheoretical manner, hindering theoretical advancement. In this paper, we offer a conceptual framework and prescriptive guidelines for applying QCA to develop causal recipes that account for complex digital phenomena marked by theoretical and configurational multiplicity. Causal recipes are formal statements explaining how causally relevant elements combine into configurations associated with outcomes of interest. We describe these causal recipes in terms of which causes matter (i.e., factorial logic) and how these causes combine into configurations (i.e., combinatorial logic) to produce target outcomes, and propose an ecology of configurations that elucidates the explanatory power of multiple configurations as well as their explanatory overlap. Further, we offer two illustrative empirical examples to demonstrate the usefulness of our framework and step-by-step guidelines for applying QCA to deductive theory testing as well as inductive theory development on phenomena marked by multiplicity."
10.1287/isre.2020.0980,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Augmenting Medical Diagnosis Decisions? An Investigation into Physicians' Decision-Making Process with Artificial Intelligence,"Systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly support physicians in diagnostic decisions, but they are not without errors and biases. Failure to detect those may result in wrong diagnoses and medical errors. Compared with rule-based systems, however, these systems are less transparent and their errors less predictable. Thus, it is difficult, yet critical, for physicians to carefully evaluate AI advice. This study uncovers the cognitive challenges that medical decision makers face when they receive potentially incorrect advice from AI-based diagnosis systems and must decide whether to follow or reject it. In experiments with 68 novice and 12 experienced physicians, novice physicians with and without clinical experience as well as experienced radiologists made more inaccurate diagnosis decisions when provided with incorrect AI advice than without advice at all. We elicit five decision-making patterns and show that wrong diagnostic decisions often result from shortcomings in utilizing metacognitions related to decision makers’ own reasoning (self-monitoring) and metacognitions related to the AI-based system (system monitoring). As a result, physicians fall for decisions based on beliefs rather than actual data or engage in unsuitably superficial evaluation of the AI advice. Our study has implications for the training of physicians and spotlights the crucial role of human actors in compensating for AI errors."
10.1093/jamia/ocad072,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Using AI-generated suggestions from ChatGPT to optimize clinical decision support,"Abstract Objective To determine if ChatGPT can generate useful suggestions for improving clinical decision support (CDS) logic and to assess noninferiority compared to human-generated suggestions. Methods We supplied summaries of CDS logic to ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) tool for question answering that uses a large language model, and asked it to generate suggestions. We asked human clinician reviewers to review the AI-generated suggestions as well as human-generated suggestions for improving the same CDS alerts, and rate the suggestions for their usefulness, acceptance, relevance, understanding, workflow, bias, inversion, and redundancy. Results Five clinicians analyzed 36 AI-generated suggestions and 29 human-generated suggestions for 7 alerts. Of the 20 suggestions that scored highest in the survey, 9 were generated by ChatGPT. The suggestions generated by AI were found to offer unique perspectives and were evaluated as highly understandable and relevant, with moderate usefulness, low acceptance, bias, inversion, redundancy. Conclusion AI-generated suggestions could be an important complementary part of optimizing CDS alerts, can identify potential improvements to alert logic and support their implementation, and may even be able to assist experts in formulating their own suggestions for CDS improvement. ChatGPT shows great potential for using large language models and reinforcement learning from human feedback to improve CDS alert logic and potentially other medical areas involving complex, clinical logic, a key step in the development of an advanced learning health system."

In the wake of this pandemic, we have witnessed a massive infodemic with the public being bombarded with vast quantities of information, much of which is not scientifically correct. Fighting fake news is now the new front in the COVID‐19 battle. This regular feature comments on the role of health sciences librarians and information professionals in combating the COVID‐19 infodemic. To support their work, it draws attention to the myth busters, fact‐checkers and credible sources relating to COVID‐19. It also documents the guides that libraries have put together to help the general public, students and faculty recognise fake news."
10.25300/MISQ/2020/16371,MIS QUARTERLY,UNDERSTANDING ECHO CHAMBERS AND FILTER BUBBLES: THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON DIVERSIFICATION AND PARTISAN SHIFTS IN NEWS CONSUMPTION,"Echo chambers and filter bubbles are potent metaphors that encapsulate widespread public fear that the use of social media may limit the information that users encounter or consume online. Specifically, the concern is that social media algorithms combined with tendencies to interact with like-minded others both limits users’ exposure to diverse viewpoints and encourages the adoption of more extreme ideological positions. Yet empirical evidence about how social media shapes information consumption is inconclusive. We articulate how characteristics of platform algorithms and users’ online social networks may combine to shape user behavior. We bring greater conceptual clarity to this phenomenon by expanding beyond discussion of a binary presence or absence of echo chambers and filter bubbles to a richer set of outcomes incorporating changes in both diversity and slant of users’ information sources. Using a data set with over four years of web browsing history for a representative panel of nearly 200,000 U.S. adults, we analyzed how individuals’ social media usage was associated with changes in the information sources they chose to consume. We find differentiated impacts on news consumption by platform. Increased use of Facebook was associated with increased information source diversity and a shift toward more partisan sites in news consumption; increased use of Reddit with increased diversity and a shift toward more moderate sites; and increased use of Twitter with little to no change in either. Our results demonstrate the value of adopting a nuanced multidimensional view of how social media use may shape information consumption."
10.1093/jamia/ocaa284,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Virtual care expansion in the Veterans Health Administration during the COVID-19 pandemic: clinical services and patient characteristics associated with utilization,"Abstract Objectives To describe the shift from in-person to virtual care within Veterans Affairs (VA) during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify at-risk patient populations who require greater resources to overcome access barriers to virtual care. Materials and Methods Outpatient encounters (N = 42 916 349) were categorized by care type (eg, primary, mental health, etc) and delivery method (eg, in-person, video). For 5 400 878 Veterans, we used generalized linear models to identify patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with: 1) use of virtual (phone or video) care versus no virtual care and 2) use of video care versus no video care between March 11, 2020 and June 6, 2020. Results By June, 58% of VA care was provided virtually compared to only 14% prior. Patients with lower income, higher disability, and more chronic conditions were more likely to receive virtual care during the pandemic. Yet, Veterans aged 45–64 and 65+ were less likely to use video care compared to those aged 18–44 (aRR 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79, 0.82] and 0.50 [95% CI 0.48, 0.52], respectively). Rural and homeless Veterans were 12% and 11% less likely to use video care compared to urban (0.88 [95% CI 0.86, 0.90]) and nonhomeless Veterans (0.89 [95% CI 0.86, 0.92]). Discussion Veterans with high clinical or social need had higher likelihood of virtual service use early in the COVID-19 pandemic; however, older, homeless, and rural Veterans were less likely to have video visits, raising concerns for access barriers. Conclusions and Relevance While virtual care may expand access, access barriers must be addressed to avoid exacerbating disparities."

Materials and Methods A COVID-19–specific remote patient monitoring solution (GetWell Loop) was offered to patients with COVID-19 symptoms. The program engaged patients and provided educational materials and the opportunity to share concerns. Alerts were resolved through a virtual care workforce of providers and medical students. Results Between March 18 and April 20, 2020, 2255 of 3701 (60.93%) patients with COVID-19 symptoms enrolled, resulting in over 2303 alerts, 4613 messages, 13 hospital admissions, and 91 emergency room visits. A satisfaction survey was given to 300 patient respondents, 74% of whom would be extremely likely to recommend their doctor. Discussion This program provided a safe and satisfying experience for patients while minimizing COVID-19 exposure and in-person healthcare utilization. Conclusions Remote patient monitoring appears to be an effective approach for managing COVID-19 symptoms at home."
10.25300/MISQ/2020/14477,MIS QUARTERLY,ORGANIZED COMPLEXITY OF DIGITAL BUSINESS STRATEGY: A CONFIGURATIONAL PERSPECTIVE,"How should firms configure organizational capabilities to achieve competitive advantage in complex digital environments? To answer this question, we investigate parsimonious configurations for high firm performance in digital environments characterized by organized complexity. We adopt a configurational perspective accompanied by a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explicate complex nonlinear relationships among key digital and non-digital capabilities in the form of conjunction, equifinality, and asymmetry in producing the outcome. With this approach, we shift attention from individual capabilities to configurations of capabilities to develop a better understanding of the complex role of IT in the digital world. Our analyses, using a rare and unique dataset of 376 observations for organizations in healthcare, education, manufacturing, and service sectors in the United States, reveal three key findings. First, IT-enabled information analytics capability alone is neither necessary nor sufficient in any configuration for high performance; however, it is an important component of the configurations in which it plays multifaceted roles varying from an enabling role in some contexts, to no role or a counterproductive role in other contexts. Second, we document a few parsimonious configurations emergent from complex nonlinear interactions among six organizational capabilities. Interestingly, these configurations often have an isomorphic structure that produces both high financial performance and high customer performance simultaneously. Third, the structures of configurations for high performance differ from those of not-high performance, suggesting an asymmetric view of causality that underpins organizational performance. Together, the findings provide implications for further research on complexity theory in digital business strategy, and for managers to view and redesign digital business strategy as configurations of IT and organizational capabilities."
10.1093/jamia/ocaa143,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Social determinants of health in electronic health records and their impact on analysis and risk prediction: A systematic review,"Abstract Objective This integrative review identifies and analyzes the extant literature to examine the integration of social determinants of health (SDoH) domains into electronic health records (EHRs), their impact on risk prediction, and the specific outcomes and SDoH domains that have been tracked. Materials and Methods In accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we conducted a literature search in the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases for English language studies published until March 2020 that examined SDoH domains in the context of EHRs. Results Our search strategy identified 71 unique studies that are directly related to the research questions. 75% of the included studies were published since 2017, and 68% were U.S.-based. 79% of the reviewed articles integrated SDoH information from external data sources into EHRs, and the rest of them extracted SDoH information from unstructured clinical notes in the EHRs. We found that all but 1 study using external area-level SDoH data reported minimum contribution to performance improvement in the predictive models. In contrast, studies that incorporated individual-level SDoH data reported improved predictive performance of various outcomes such as service referrals, medication adherence, and risk of 30-day readmission. We also found little consensus on the SDoH measures used in the literature and current screening tools. Conclusions The literature provides early and rapidly growing evidence that integrating individual-level SDoH into EHRs can assist in risk assessment and predicting healthcare utilization and health outcomes, which further motivates efforts to collect and standardize patient-level SDoH information."

We summarized these studies based on the year of publication, prediction tasks, machine learning algorithm, dataset(s) used to build the models, the scope, category, and evaluation of the XAI methods. We further assessed the reproducibility of the studies in terms of the availability of data and code and discussed open issues and challenges.ResultsForty-two articles were included in this review. We reported the research trend and most-studied diseases. We grouped XAI methods into 5 categories: knowledge distillation and rule extraction (N = 13), intrinsically interpretable models (N = 9), data dimensionality reduction (N = 8), attention mechanism (N = 7), and feature interaction and importance (N = 5).DiscussionXAI evaluation is an open issue that requires a deeper focus in the case of medical applications. We also discuss the importance of reproducibility of research work in this field, as well as the challenges and opportunities of XAI from 2 medical professionals’ point of view.ConclusionBased on our review, we found that XAI evaluation in medicine has not been adequately and formally practiced. Reproducibility remains a critical concern. Ample opportunities exist to advance XAI research in medicine."
10.1093/jamia/ocz166,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,2018 n2c2 shared task on adverse drug events and medication extraction in electronic health records,"Abstract Objective This article summarizes the preparation, organization, evaluation, and results of Track 2 of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges shared task. Track 2 focused on extraction of adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical records and evaluated 3 tasks: concept extraction, relation classification, and end-to-end systems. We perform an analysis of the results to identify the state of the art in these tasks, learn from it, and build on it. Materials and Methods For all tasks, teams were given raw text of narrative discharge summaries, and in all the tasks, participants proposed deep learning–based methods with hand-designed features. In the concept extraction task, participants used sequence labelling models (bidirectional long short-term memory being the most popular), whereas in the relation classification task, they also experimented with instance-based classifiers (namely support vector machines and rules). Ensemble methods were also popular. Results A total of 28 teams participated in task 1, with 21 teams in tasks 2 and 3. The best performing systems set a high performance bar with F1 scores of 0.9418 for concept extraction, 0.9630 for relation classification, and 0.8905 for end-to-end. However, the results were much lower for concepts and relations of Reasons and ADEs. These were often missed because local context is insufficient to identify them. Conclusions This challenge shows that clinical concept extraction and relation classification systems have a high performance for many concept types, but significant improvement is still required for ADEs and Reasons. Incorporating the larger context or outside knowledge will likely improve the performance of future systems."
10.1287/isre.2021.1015,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,"Estimating the Impact of ""Humanizing"" Customer Service Chatbots","In this work, we investigate how applying human-like characteristics to customer service chatbots can influence retail outcomes. This is an important managerial question as creating effective chatbot experiences through messaging platforms has proven difficult for organizations. Often, chatbot developers apply characteristics such as giving a chatbot a human name, adding humor, and so on, without knowing how these features influence end user behavior. Implementing a field experiment in collaboration with a dual channel clothing retailer based in the United States, we automate a used clothing buy-back process, such that individuals engage with the retailer's autonomous chatbot to describe the used clothes they wish to sell, obtain a cash offer, and (if they accept) print a shipping label to finalize the transaction. We provide evidence that, in this retail setting, anthropomorphism is beneficial for transaction outcomes, but that it also leads to significant increases in consumers’ sensitivity to the offer amount. We argue that the latter effect occurs because, as a chatbot becomes more human-like, consumers shift to a fairness evaluation or negotiating mindset."
10.1093/jamia/ocac093,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,The harm of class imbalance corrections for risk prediction models: illustration and simulation using logistic regression,"Abstract Objective Methods to correct class imbalance (imbalance between the frequency of outcome events and nonevents) are receiving increasing interest for developing prediction models. We examined the effect of imbalance correction on the performance of logistic regression models. Material and Methods Prediction models were developed using standard and penalized (ridge) logistic regression under 4 methods to address class imbalance: no correction, random undersampling, random oversampling, and SMOTE. Model performance was evaluated in terms of discrimination, calibration, and classification. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we studied the impact of training set size, number of predictors, and the outcome event fraction. A case study on prediction modeling for ovarian cancer diagnosis is presented. Results The use of random undersampling, random oversampling, or SMOTE yielded poorly calibrated models: the probability to belong to the minority class was strongly overestimated. These methods did not result in higher areas under the ROC curve when compared with models developed without correction for class imbalance. Although imbalance correction improved the balance between sensitivity and specificity, similar results were obtained by shifting the probability threshold instead. Discussion Imbalance correction led to models with strong miscalibration without better ability to distinguish between patients with and without the outcome event. The inaccurate probability estimates reduce the clinical utility of the model, because decisions about treatment are ill-informed. Conclusion Outcome imbalance is not a problem in itself, imbalance correction may even worsen model performance."
10.25300/MISQ/2021/15864,MIS QUARTERLY,CONNECTING THE PARTS WITH THE WHOLE: TOWARD AN INFORMATION ECOLOGY THEORY OF DIGITAL INNOVATION ECOSYSTEMS,"The remarkable connectivity and embeddedness of digital technologies enable innovations undertaken by a broad set of actors, often beyond organizational and industry boundaries, whose relationships mimic those of interdependent species in a natural ecosystem. These digital innovation ecosystems, if successful, can spawn countless innovations of substantial social and economic value, but are complex and prone to often surprising failure. Aiming to understand ecosystems as a new organizational form for digital innovations, I develop a theory that addresses an underexplored but important question: In a digital innovation ecosystem, how are the efforts of autonomous parties integrated into a coherent whole and what role do digital technologies play in this integration? By synthesizing ecological and information perspectives, this information ecology theory identifies several key functions that digital technologies serve in providing the information needed to support the interactions and tasks for innovation in ecosystems of varying scales. This theory contributes to digital innovation research new insights on managing part–whole relations, the role of digital technologies in innovation, and multilevel interactions in and across digital innovation ecosystems. The theory can also inspire the development of next-generation information systems for ecosystems as a new organizational form."

Descriptive information about safety concerns and consequences were extracted and classified into natural categories. The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) statement.ResultsOf the 74 studies identified, the majority were reviews of a single or a group of similar apps (n = 66, 89%), nearly half related to disease management (n = 34, 46%). A total of 80 safety concerns were identified, 67 related to the quality of information presented including incorrect or incomplete information, variation in content, and incorrect or inappropriate response to consumer needs. The remaining 13 related to app functionality including gaps in features, lack of validation for user input, delayed processing, failure to respond to health dangers, and faulty alarms. Of the 52 reports of actual or potential consequences, 5 had potential for patient harm. We also identified 66 reports about gaps in app development, including the lack of expert involvement, poor evidence base, and poor validation.ConclusionsSafety of apps is an emerging public health issue. The available evidence shows that apps pose clinical risks to consumers. Involvement of consumers, regulators, and healthcare professionals in development and testing can improve quality. Additionally, mandatory reporting of safety concerns is needed to improve outcomes."

THE DANGERS OF TRAINING AND EVALUATING AI TOOLS BASED ON EXPERTS' KNOW-WHAT1,"Organizational decision-makers need to evaluate AI tools in light of increasing claims that such tools outperform human experts. Yet, measuring the quality of knowledge work is challenging, raising the question of how to evaluate AI performance in such contexts. We investigate this question through a field study of a major U.S. hospital, observing how managers evaluated five different machine-learning (ML) based AI tools. Each tool reported high performance according to standard AI accuracy measures, which were based on ground truth labels provided by qualified experts. Trying these tools out in practice, however, revealed that none of them met expectations. Searching for explanations, managers began confronting the high uncertainty of experts’ know-what knowledge captured in ground truth labels used to train and validate ML models. In practice, experts address this uncertainty by drawing on rich know-how practices, which were not incorporated into these ML-based tools. Discovering the disconnect between AI’s know-what and experts’ know-how enabled managers to better understand the risks and benefits of each tool. This study shows dangers of treating ground truth labels used in ML models objectively when the underlying knowledge is uncertain. We outline implications of our study for developing, training, and evaluating AI for knowledge work."

It takes as its focus VOSviewer, a freely available software package used to construct and display bibliometric relationships between a variety of variables. Beginning with published examples, the paper proceeds to create an original case study using bibliometrics to explore the extent to which the field of remote sensing is contributing to the implementation of sustainable development goals. This example uses Scopus data and VOSviewer to examine and contrast co-occurrence data among publications in six journals, and it demonstrates how such software can be successfully used to undertake preliminary studies and to shape subsequent research which employs more formal approaches."
10.25300/MISQ/2020/14520,MIS QUARTERLY,DIGITIZATION AND PHASE TRANSITIONS IN PLATFORM ORGANIZING LOGICS: EVIDENCE FROM THE PROCESS AUTOMATION INDUSTRY,"This paper draws on complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory to explore the transformation of an analog automation product platform as it was infused with extensive and deepening digital capacities over a 40-year period. Our case demonstrates how the deepening digitization of components and functions drives complexity by connecting the platform to multiple social and technical settings and producing new interactions and information exchanges. The increased connectivity and dynamism invited unexpected and significant architectural and organizational shifts that moved the platform toward an ecosystem-centered organizing logic. CAS theory and its notion of constrained generating procedures (CGPs) are used to analyze how new connections and interactions produced a multilevel and nonlinear change in the platform organization. We offer two main contributions. First, we provide a novel empirical analysis of how product platform digitization leads to phase transitions and show the mediating role of three mechanisms in this process treated as CGPs: interaction rules, design control, and stimuli-response variety. Second, we demonstrate the multilevel and recursive nature of digitally driven growth in physical product platforms."

While clear classifications and validated measures of burnout exist, documentation burden remains ill-defined and inconsistently measured. We aim to conduct a scoping review focused on identifying approaches to documentation burden measurement and their characteristics. Materials and Methods Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews (ScR) guidelines, we conducted a scoping review assessing MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to April 2020 for studies investigating documentation burden among physicians and nurses in ambulatory or inpatient settings. Two reviewers evaluated each potentially relevant study for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results Of the 3482 articles retrieved, 35 studies met inclusion criteria. We identified 15 measurement characteristics, including 7 effort constructs: EHR usage and workload, clinical documentation/review, EHR work after hours and remotely, administrative tasks, cognitively cumbersome work, fragmentation of workflow, and patient interaction. We uncovered 4 time constructs: average time, proportion of time, timeliness of completion, activity rate, and 11 units of analysis. Only 45.0% of studies assessed the impact of EHRs on clinicians and/or patients and 40.0% mentioned clinician burnout. Discussion Standard and validated measures of documentation burden are lacking. While time and effort were the core concepts measured, there appears to be no consensus on the best approach nor degree of rigor to study documentation burden. Conclusion Further research is needed to reliably operationalize the concept of documentation burden, explore best practices for measurement, and standardize its use."
10.1093/jcmc/zmz031,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,Cyberbullying Perpetration and Victimization in Youth: A Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Studies,"AbstractCyberbullying perpetration (CP) and victimization (CV) are prevalent issues in adolescent development. However, previous meta-analyses focused only on cross-sectional findings. The present study aims to meta-analytically summarize 56 longitudinal studies on CP, CV, and related factors in children and adolescents. Forty meta-analyses on CP and CV as both predictors and outcomes of person-related, Internet activity-related, and contextual factors were performed. Additional moderator analyses took into account study design, sample population, and quality of the studies. Results highlight reciprocal longitudinal effects among CP, CV, and both traditional bullying and victimization: CP causes externalizing problem behaviors over time, whereas CV constitutes a risk factor of internalizing problems, such as depression and anxiety. Conversely, behavioral problems and increased Internet use predict involvement in CP, while depression, anxiety, and Internet use also predict CV over time. Further longitudinal research is needed to provide empirical evidence on understudied concepts."
10.1093/jamia/ocab136,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Transgender data collection in the electronic health record: Current concepts and issues,"AbstractThere are over 1 million transgender people living in the United States, and 33% report negative experiences with a healthcare provider, many of which are connected to data representation in electronic health records (EHRs). We present recommendations and common pitfalls involving sex- and gender-related data collection in EHRs. Our recommendations leverage the needs of patients, medical providers, and researchers to optimize both individual patient experiences and the efficacy and reproducibility of EHR population-based studies. We also briefly discuss adequate additions to the EHR considering name and pronoun usage. We add the disclaimer that these questions are more complex than commonly assumed. We conclude that collaborations between local transgender and gender-diverse persons and medical providers as well as open inclusion of transgender and gender-diverse individuals on terminology and standards boards is crucial to shifting the paradigm in transgender and gender-diverse health."
10.25300/MISQ/2021/16553,MIS QUARTERLY,WILL HUMANS-IN-THE-LOOP BECOME BORGS? MERITS AND PITFALLS OF WORKING WITH AI,"We analyze how advice from an AI affects complementarities between humans and AI, in particular what humans know that an AI does not know: “unique human knowledge.” In a multi-method study consisting of an analytical model, experimental studies, and a simulation study, our main finding is that human choices converge toward similar responses improving individual accuracy. However, as overall individual accuracy of the group of humans improves, the individual unique human knowledge decreases. Based on this finding, we claim that humans interacting with AI behave like “Borgs,” that is, cyborg creatures with strong individual performance but no human individuality. We argue that the loss of unique human knowledge may lead to several undesirable outcomes in a host of human–AI decision environments. We demonstrate this harmful impact on the “wisdom of crowds.” Simulation results based on our experimental data suggest that groups of humans interacting with AI are far less effective as compared to human groups without AI assistance. We suggest mitigation techniques to create environments that can provide the best of both worlds (e.g., by personalizing AI advice). We show that such interventions perform well individually as well as in wisdom of crowds settings."

Materials and Methods Deep learning models were trained at each participating institution using local clinical data, and an additional model was trained using FL across all of the institutions. Results We found that the FL model exhibited superior performance and generalizability to the models trained at single institutions, with an overall performance level that was significantly better than that of any of the institutional models alone when evaluated on held-out test sets from each institution and an outside challenge dataset. Discussion The power of FL was successfully demonstrated across 3 academic institutions while avoiding the privacy risk associated with the transfer and pooling of patient data. Conclusion Federated learning is an effective methodology that merits further study to enable accelerated development of models across institutions, enabling greater generalizability in clinical use."
10.1093/jamia/ocaa216,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Characteristics of telehealth users in NYC for COVID-related care during the coronavirus pandemic,"Abstract Objective To explore whether racial/ethnic differences in telehealth use existed during the peak pandemic period among NYC patients seeking care for COVID-19 related symptoms. Materials and Methods This study used data from a large health system in NYC – the epicenter of the US crisis – to describe characteristics of patients seeking COVID-related care via telehealth, ER, or office encounters during the peak pandemic period. Using multinomial logistic regression, we estimated the magnitude of the relationship between patient characteristics and the odds of having a first encounter via telehealth versus ER or office visit, and then used regression parameter estimates to predict patients’ probabilities of using different encounter types given their characteristics. Results Demographic factors, including race/ethnicity and age, were significantly predictive of telehealth use. As compared to Whites, Blacks had higher adjusted odds of using both the ER versus telehealth (OR: 4.3, 95% CI: 4.0-4.6) and office visits versus telehealth (OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.3-1.5). For Hispanics versus Whites, the analogous ORs were 2.5 (95% CI: 2.3-2.7) and 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1-1.3). Compared to any age groups, patients 65+ had significantly higher odds of using either ER or office visits versus telehealth. Conclusions The response to COVID-19 has involved an unprecedented expansion in telehealth. While older Americans and minority populations among others are known to be disadvantaged by the digital divide, few studies have examined disparities in telehealth specifically, and none during COVID-19. Additional research into sociodemographic heterogeneity in telehealth use is needed to prevent potentially further exacerbating health disparities overall."

Materials and Methods We created a patient portal-based COVID-19 self-triage and self-scheduling tool and made it available to all primary care patients at the University of California, San Francisco Health, a large academic health system. Asymptomatic patients were asked about exposure history and were then provided relevant information. Symptomatic patients were triaged into 1 of 4 categories—emergent, urgent, nonurgent, or self-care—and then connected with the appropriate level of care via direct scheduling or telephone hotline. Results This self-triage and self-scheduling tool was designed and implemented in under 2 weeks. During the first 16 days of use, it was completed 1129 times by 950 unique patients. Of completed sessions, 315 (28%) were by asymptomatic patients, and 814 (72%) were by symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patient triage dispositions were as follows: 193 emergent (24%), 193 urgent (24%), 99 nonurgent (12%), 329 self-care (40%). Sensitivity for detecting emergency-level care was 87.5% (95% CI 61.7–98.5%). Discussion This self-triage and self-scheduling tool has been widely used by patients and is being rapidly expanded to other populations and health systems. The tool has recommended emergency-level care with high sensitivity, and decreased triage time for patients with less severe illness. The data suggests it also prevents unnecessary triage messages, phone calls, and in-person visits. Conclusion Patient self-triage tools integrated into electronic health record systems have the potential to greatly improve triage efficiency and prevent unnecessary visits during the COVID-19 pandemic."
10.1111/isj.12307,INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL,A paradoxical perspective on technology renewal in digital transformation,"AbstractTo realize their strategic goals and maintain a competitive advantage in the digital era, organizations must periodically renew their digital platforms and infrastructures. However, knowledge about such technology renewal is scattered across diverse research streams, so insights into the process are both limited and fragmented. In this article, we consolidate insights from previous research to conceptualize technology renewal as an inherently paradoxical digital transformation process that requires organizations to simultaneously remove their technological foundation and build on the practices that depend on it to implement a new technological foundation. Previous research suggests that technology renewal initiatives are driven by three paradoxical tensions: (a) established vs renewed technology usage, (b) deliberate vs emergent renewal practices and (c) inner vs outer renewal contexts. We apply this framing to a longitudinal case study in which we analyse and explain how an organization's responses to manifestations of these tensions eventually led to a vicious cycle of continued investments into two overlapping and largely incompatible digital platforms over a 9‐year period. Based on these conceptual and empirical insights, we theorize technology renewal as a paradoxical, and increasingly critical, digital transformation process that forces managers to make decisions in complex and ambiguous choice situations."
10.1093/database/baac008,DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION,PlasticDB: a database of microorganisms and proteins linked to plastic biodegradation,"Abstract The number of publications reporting putative plastic-degrading microbes and proteins is continuously increasing, necessitating the compilation of these data and the development of tools to facilitate their analysis. We developed the PlasticDB web application to address this need, which comprises a database of microorganisms and proteins reported to biodegrade plastics. Associated metadata, such as the techniques utilized to assess biodegradation, the environmental source of microbial isolate and presumed thermophilic traits are also reported. Proteins in the database are categorized according to the plastic type they are reported to degrade. Each protein structure has been predicted in silico and can be visualized or downloaded for further investigation. In addition to standard database functionalities, such as searching, filtering and retrieving database records, we implemented several analytical tools that accept inputs, including gene, genome, metagenome, transcriptomes, metatranscriptomes and taxa table data. Users can now analyze their datasets for the presence of putative plastic-degrading species and potential plastic-degrading proteins and pathways from those species.

10.25300/MISQ/2020/14870,MIS QUARTERLY,ENHANCING SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSIS WITH VISUAL DATA ANALYTICS: A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH,"This research methods article proposes a visual data analytics framework to enhance social media research using deep learning models. Drawing on the literature of information systems and marketing, complemented with data-driven methods, we propose a number of visual and textual content features including complexity, similarity, and consistency measures that can play important roles in the persuasiveness of social media content. We then employ state-of-the-art machine learning approaches such as deep learning and text mining to operationalize these new content features in a scalable and systematic manner. For the newly developed features, we validate them against human coders on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies with a large social media dataset from Tumblr to show the effectiveness of the proposed content features. The first case study demonstrates that both theoretically motivated and data-driven features significantly improve the model’s power to predict the popularity of a post, and the second one highlights the relationships between content features and consumer evaluations of the corresponding posts. The proposed research framework illustrates how deep learning methods can enhance the analysis of unstructured visual and textual data for social media research."
10.1093/jcmc/zmz024,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,Computer-Mediated Communication in the Age of Communication Visibility,"AbstractThis article argues that a distinctive aspect of computer-mediated communication (CMC) is the way it can make communication visible to others in ways that were previously impractical. We propose a theory of communication visibility that recognizes its multidimensional nature: resulting from activities that make communication visible, efforts by actors to see communication, and a sociomaterial context that influences possibilities for visibility. The different dimensions of communication visibility are explored as they relate to possibilities for action with CMC, and the ability of third-parties to view communication between others. Centering communication visibility in the study of CMC compels scholars to ask new questions regarding the interdependence of active, strategic efforts to make communication more or less visible to others, and the ways in which communication is assessed by observers. To facilitate ongoing research we offer an agenda for incorporating communication visibility into the study of contemporary and future forms of CMC."

While various ‘atlas’ projects have collated some of the associated datasets, most questions related to specific tissue types, species or other attributes of studies require identifying papers through manual and challenging literature search. To facilitate discovery with published single-cell transcriptomics data, we have assembled a near exhaustive, manually curated database of single-cell transcriptomics studies with key information: descriptions of the type of data and technologies used, along with descriptors of the biological systems studied. Additionally, the database contains summarized information about analysis in the papers, allowing for analysis of trends in the field. As an example, we show that the number of cell types identified in scRNA-seq studies is proportional to the number of cells analysed. Database URL: www.nxn.se/single-cell-studies/gui"
10.1287/isre.2020.0927,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Appealing to Sense and Sensibility: System 1 and System 2 Interventions for Fake News on Social Media,"Disinformation on social media—commonly called “fake news”—has become a major concern around the world, and many fact-checking initiatives have been launched in response. However, if the presentation format of fact-checked results is not persuasive, fact-checking may not be effective. For instance, Facebook tested the idea of flagging dubious articles in 2017 but concluded that it was ineffective and removed the feature. We conducted three experiments with social media users to investigate two different approaches to implementing a fake news flag—one designed to be most effective when processed by automatic cognition (System 1) and the other designed to be most effective when processed by deliberate cognition (System 2). Both interventions were effective, and an intervention that combined both approaches was about twice as effective. The awareness training on the meaning of the flags increased the effectiveness of the System 2 intervention but not the System 1 intervention. Believability influenced the extent to which users would engage with the article (e.g., read, like, comment, and share). Our results suggest that both theoretical routes can be used—separately or together—in the presentation of fact-checking results in order to reduce the influence of fake news on social media users."

Here, we describe the development of a new statistical mining module, which permits several differential gene expression analyses, i.e. ‘Expression’ module. Sixty-two breast cancer cohorts and one healthy breast cohort with their corresponding clinicopathological information are included in bc-GenExMiner v4.5 version. Analyses are based on microarray or RNAseq transcriptomic data. Thirty-nine differential gene expression analyses, grouped into 13 categories, according to clinicopathological and molecular characteristics (‘Targeted’ and ‘Exhaustive’) and gene expression (‘Customized’), have been developed. Output results are visualized in four forms of plots. This new statistical mining module offers, among other things, the possibility to compare gene expression in healthy (cancer-free), tumour-adjacent and tumour tissues at once and in three triple-negative breast cancer subtypes (i.e. C1: molecular apocrine tumours; C2: basal-like tumours infiltrated by immune suppressive cells and C3: basal-like tumours triggering an ineffective immune response). Several validation tests showed that bioinformatics process did not alter the pathobiological information contained in the source data. In this work, we developed and demonstrated that bc-GenExMiner ‘Expression’ module can be used for exploratory and validation purposes. Database URL: http://bcgenex.ico.unicancer.fr"
10.1093/jamia/ocab170,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Extracting social determinants of health from electronic health records using natural language processing: a systematic review,"Abstract Objective Social determinants of health (SDoH) are nonclinical dispositions that impact patient health risks and clinical outcomes. Leveraging SDoH in clinical decision-making can potentially improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Despite increased interest in capturing SDoH in electronic health records (EHRs), such information is typically locked in unstructured clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract SDoH information from clinical text and expand its utility in patient care and research. This article presents a systematic review of the state-of-the-art NLP approaches and tools that focus on identifying and extracting SDoH data from unstructured clinical text in EHRs. Materials and Methods A broad literature search was conducted in February 2021 using 3 scholarly databases (ACL Anthology, PubMed, and Scopus) following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 6402 publications were initially identified, and after applying the study inclusion criteria, 82 publications were selected for the final review. Results Smoking status (n = 27), substance use (n = 21), homelessness (n = 20), and alcohol use (n = 15) are the most frequently studied SDoH categories. Homelessness (n = 7) and other less-studied SDoH (eg, education, financial problems, social isolation and support, family problems) are mostly identified using rule-based approaches. In contrast, machine learning approaches are popular for identifying smoking status (n = 13), substance use (n = 9), and alcohol use (n = 9). Conclusion NLP offers significant potential to extract SDoH data from narrative clinical notes, which in turn can aid in the development of screening tools, risk prediction models, and clinical decision support systems."
10.1093/jamia/ocaa221,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Racial and ethnic differences in self-reported telehealth use during the COVID-19 pandemic: a secondary analysis of a US survey of internet users from late March,"Abstract Objective Widespread technological changes, like the rapid uptake of telehealth in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic, risk creating or widening racial/ethnic disparities. We conducted a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of internet users to evaluate whether there were racial/ethnic disparities in self-reported telehealth use early in the pandemic. Materials and Methods The Pew Research Center fielded the survey March 19–24, 2020. Telehealth use because of the pandemic was measured by asking whether respondents (N = 10 624) “used the internet or e-mail to connect with doctors or other medical professionals as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.” We conducted survey-weighted logistic regressions, adjusting for respondents’ socioeconomic characteristics and perceived threat of the pandemic to their own health (eg, no threat, minor, major). Results Approximately 17% of respondents reported using telehealth because of the pandemic, with significantly higher unadjusted odds among Blacks, Latinos, and those identified with other race compared to White respondents. The multivariable logistic regressions and sensitivity analyses show Black respondents were more likely than Whites to report using telehealth because of the pandemic, particularly when perceiving the pandemic as a minor threat to their own health. Discussion Black respondents are most likely to report using telehealth because of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly when they perceive the pandemic as a minor health threat. Conclusion The systemic racism creating health and health care disparities has likely raised the need for telehealth among Black patients during the pandemic. Findings suggest opportunities to leverage a broadly defined set of telehealth tools to reduce health care disparities postpandemic."

10.1093/jamia/ocz229,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,"Physician understanding, explainability, and trust in a hypothetical machine learning risk calculator","Abstract Objective Implementation of machine learning (ML) may be limited by patients’ right to “meaningful information about the logic involved” when ML influences healthcare decisions. Given the complexity of healthcare decisions, it is likely that ML outputs will need to be understood and trusted by physicians, and then explained to patients. We therefore investigated the association between physician understanding of ML outputs, their ability to explain these to patients, and their willingness to trust the ML outputs, using various ML explainability methods. Materials and Methods We designed a survey for physicians with a diagnostic dilemma that could be resolved by an ML risk calculator. Physicians were asked to rate their understanding, explainability, and trust in response to 3 different ML outputs. One ML output had no explanation of its logic (the control) and 2 ML outputs used different model-agnostic explainability methods. The relationships among understanding, explainability, and trust were assessed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests of association. Results The survey was sent to 1315 physicians, and 170 (13%) provided completed surveys. There were significant associations between physician understanding and explainability (P &amp;lt; .001), between physician understanding and trust (P &amp;lt; .001), and between explainability and trust (P &amp;lt; .001). ML outputs that used model-agnostic explainability methods were preferred by 88% of physicians when compared with the control condition; however, no particular ML explainability method had a greater influence on intended physician behavior. Conclusions Physician understanding, explainability, and trust in ML risk calculators are related. Physicians preferred ML outputs accompanied by model-agnostic explanations but the explainability method did not alter intended physician behavior."
10.1111/isj.12243,INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL,Mitigating the intrusive effects of smart home assistants by using anthropomorphic design features: A multimethod investigation,"AbstractWith the growing proliferation of smart home assistants (SHAs), digital services are increasingly pervading people's private households. Through their intrusive features, SHAs threaten to not only increase individual users' strain but also impair social relationships at home. However, while previous research has predominantly focused on technology features' detrimental effects on employee strain at work, there is still a lack of understanding of the adverse effects of digital devices on individuals and their social relations at home. In addition, we know little about how these deleterious effects can be mitigated by using information technology (IT) artefact‐based design features. Drawing on the person‐technology fit model, self‐regulation theory, and the literature on anthropomorphism, we used the synergistic properties of an online experiment (N = 136) and a follow‐up field survey with a representative sample of SHA users (N = 214) to show how and why SHAs' intrusive technology features cause strain and interpersonal conflicts at home. Moreover, we demonstrate how SHAs' anthropomorphic design features can attenuate the harmful effects of intrusive technology features on strain by shaping users' feelings of privacy invasion. More broadly, our study sheds light on the largely underinvestigated psychological and social consequences of the digitization of the individual at home."
10.1111/hir.12287,HEALTH INFORMATION AND LIBRARIES JOURNAL,Health information seeking behaviour: a concept analysis,"AbstractBackgroundIn 2007, Lambert and Loiselle conducted an extensive concept analysis of the term health information seeking behaviour (HISB) to examine the concept's level of maturity and critically analyse its characteristics. Since their groundbreaking work, HISB has evolved with the proliferation of ICTs. The Internet is now a common and often preferred medium for the pursuit of health information.ObjectivesThe previous analysis spanned 42 years of literature; this article describes an analysis of the last 10 years of literature on HISB and how online seeking has caused the concept to evolve in the literature.MethodsThis study used the concept analysis methodology employed by Lambert and Loiselle in the original analysis. It also included a systematic search conducted in five databases to identify studies from 2007 to 2017, using similar inclusion criteria from the original study.ResultsOf the more than 500 articles retrieved, 85 journal articles met the inclusion criteria. Consistent with the original work, articles that included outcomes were identified as either behavioural or cognitive.ConclusionMost of the attention of the works studied focused on individuals and their information source preferences. This HISB analysis can be incorporated with studies to understand how various communities seek information in online versus non‐online contexts."
10.1093/jcmc/zmab005,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,Emotional Support from AI Chatbots: Should a Supportive Partner Self-Disclose or Not?,"Abstract This study examined how and when a chatbot’s emotional support was effective in reducing people’s stress and worry. It compared emotional support from chatbot versus human partners in terms of its process and conditional effects on stress/worry reduction. In an online experiment, participants discussed a personal stressor with a chatbot or a human partner who provided none, or either one or both of emotional support and reciprocal self-disclosure. The results showed that emotional support from a conversational partner was mediated through perceived supportiveness of the partner to reduce stress and worry among participants, and the link from emotional support to perceived supportiveness was stronger for a human than for a chatbot. A conversational partner’s reciprocal self-disclosure enhanced the positive effect of emotional support on worry reduction. However, when emotional support was absent, a solely self-disclosing chatbot reduced even less stress than a chatbot not providing any response to participants’ stress. Lay Summary In recent years, AI chatbots have increasingly been used to provide empathy and support to people who are experiencing stressful times. This study compared emotional support from a chatbot compared to that of a human who provided support. We were interested in examining which approach could best effectively reduce people’s worry and stress. When either a person or a chatbot was able to engage with a stressed individual and tell that individual about their own experiences, they were able to build rapport. We found that this type of reciprocal self-disclosure was effective in calming the worry of the individual. Interestingly, if a chatbot only reciprocally self-disclosed but offered no emotional support, the outcome was worse than if the chatbot did not respond to people at all. This work will help in the development of supportive chatbots by providing insights into when and what they should self-disclose."
10.25300/MISQ/2020/15102,MIS QUARTERLY,THE EFFECTS OF PARTICIPATING IN A PHYSICIAN-DRIVEN ONLINE HEALTH COMMUNITY IN MANAGING CHRONIC DISEASE: EVIDENCE FROM TWO NATURAL EXPERIMENTS,"This research examines physician-driven online health communities (OHC), a social media application in healthcare that engages both patients and physicians. Drawing on the “patient–physician partnership” paradigm in managing chronic disease (Bodenheimer et al. 2002), we argue that physician-driven OHC facilitates patient–physician collaborative care and self-management support, which may improve patient well-being and patient–physician relationships. We test the mutual impact between patients’ and physicians’ participation in physician-driven OHC and the impact of patients’ and physicians’ participation on patient well-being and the patient–physician relationship in the context of managing diabetes and depression. We collect data from a leading Chinese online consultation platform. To make credible causal inference, we exploit two events that separately create plausibly exogenous variations in patients’ and physicians’ participation. We find that physicians’ participation significantly increases patients’ participation for both diabetes and depression, but patients’ participation only increases physicians’ participation for depression. Although both patients’ and physicians’ participation significantly improve patient well-being and the patient–physician relationship, there are interesting nuances in these effects over time. These findings have important implications for self-managing chronic diseases and healthcare policy making."

The set of skills and competences integrating digital literacy are expected to be guaranteed in higher education. During the lockdown globally imposed for the COVID-19 pandemic, educational systems worldwide had to face many disruptive changes. The aim of this research is to present a comparative study of three countries’ higher education institutions (Spain, Italy, and Ecuador), analyzing how they have faced the global lockdown situation, focusing on the development of digital literacy. The methodological approach followed in this study was quantitative with an exploratory-correlational scope using a questionnaire designed ad hoc and applied in a sample of 376 students. Results point the necessity of enhancing the main aspects such as the teacher’s digital skills, sources for learning that may be adapted, communication between universities and students, and teaching methodologies that should be appropriate to the current context. Conclusions may suggest rethinking higher education learning and reinforcing main issues for this transformation, mainly: communication, teaching, and digital competences. Otherwise, digital literacy is not being guaranteed, which means higher education is not accomplishing one of its main objectives."
10.25300/MISQ/2020/14193,MIS QUARTERLY,HOW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MATTERS IN SOCIETAL CHANGE: AN AFFORDANCE-BASED INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS PERSPECTIVE,"While there has been much work on the relationship between information technology (IT) and organizational change, there has been limited research that theorizes the relationship between IT and societal change. This paper draws on institutional theory, in particular institutional logics, to develop a model of IT and societal change, which we argue is critical in an era of large-scale digital transformation. Our approach is based on a view of society as an interinstitutional system, reflecting the multiplicity of logics at the societal level. We conceptualize societal change as shifts in the multiplicity of logics, with a focus on changes in the levels of centrality and compatibility. Our model relates these changes to the materiality of technology through the concept of IT affordances. We propose three mechanisms (sensegiving, translating, and decoupling) through which IT affordances become elements of societal change. We identify three corresponding carriers through which IT affordances gain scale and stability (objects, networks, and platforms). We discuss the implications of our theoretical developments for future research on IT and societal change."
10.1287/isre.2019.0910,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,"Fake News, Investor Attention, and Market Reaction","Does fake news in financial markets attract more investor attention and have a significant impact on stock prices? The authors use the SEC crackdown of stock promotion schemes in April 2017 to examine investor attention and the stock price reaction to fake news articles. Using data from Seeking Alpha, the authors find that fake news stories generate significantly more attention than a control sample of legitimate articles. The authors find no evidence that article commenters can detect fake news, and they find that Seeking Alpha editors have only modest ability to detect fake news. However, the authors implement several well-known machine learning algorithms based on linguistic characteristics and show that machine learning algorithms can successfully identify fake news. In addition, the stock market appears to price fake news correctly. While abnormal trading volume increases around the release of fake news, the increase is less than that observed for legitimate news. The stock price reaction to fake news is discounted when compared with legitimate news articles."
10.25300/MISQ/2020/14911,MIS QUARTERLY,A DAILY FIELD INVESTIGATION OF TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN SPILLOVERS FROM WORK TO HOME,"Although recent theoretical developments and empirical studies indicate that technology-related stress may have negative and positive consequences for employees across life domains, the majority of previous IS research on technostress has focused on its downsides at work and has neglected to study how and why technology-related stress may spill over from work to home. Furthermore, while much of our knowledge of technology-related stress and its effects derives from cross-sectional studies examining between-person differences, there is a need for longitudinal, daily investigations that take a within-person view. Integrating the challenge–hindrance stressor framework with affective events theory and work–home spillover literature, we propose a broader conceptualization of technology-related stressors, referred to as technology-driven (TD) stressors, which comprise technology-driven challenge (TCS) and hindrance (THS) stressors, and examine how and why daily TCS and THS experienced at work affect the relationship between employees and their partners at home. In an experience sampling study of 115 employees who responded to daily surveys both at work and at home over a two-week period, we found that while THS are negatively related to partnership satisfaction via negative affect, TCS are positively related to partnership satisfaction via positive affect. We also investigated the moderating effect of work–home role integration (WHI) and perceived organizational support in work–home boundary management (POS) on the strength of the within-individual spillover processes. Our results show that WHI acts as a double-edged sword for letting TCS- and THS-triggered positive and negative affect spill over to partnership satisfaction, whereas POS serves as a facilitator of positive affect and as a buffer against negative affect. Broadly, our study shows that understanding daily TD work stressors is important because their negative and positive downstream effects often do not stop at employees’ workplace boundaries but actually penetrate and shape their everyday lives at home."

We systematically review these articles to understand the effectiveness of this approach, identify any issues and report the main findings that can guide further research.Materials and MethodsWe searched PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science for articles published in English between 2013 and 2019. We performed a systematic literature review to answer 5 key questions: (1) What were the characteristics of participant groups? (2) What language data were collected? (3) What features of speech and language were the most informative? (4) What methods were used to classify between groups? (5) What classification performance was achieved?Results and DiscussionWe identified 33 eligible studies and 5 main findings: participants’ demographic variables (especially age ) were often unbalanced between AD and control group; spontaneous speech data were collected most often; informative language features were related to word retrieval and semantic, syntactic, and acoustic impairment; neural nets, support vector machines, and decision trees performed well in AD detection, and support vector machines and decision trees performed well in decline detection; and average classification accuracy was 89% in AD and 82% in mild cognitive impairment detection versus healthy control groups.ConclusionThe systematic literature review supported the argument that language and speech could successfully be used to detect dementia automatically. Future studies should aim for larger and more balanced datasets, combine data collection methods and the type of information analyzed, focus on the early stages of the disease, and report performance using standardized metrics."
10.1093/database/baab069,DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION,OBO Foundry in 2021: operationalizing open data principles to evaluate ontologies,"Abstract Biological ontologies are used to organize, curate and interpret the vast quantities of data arising from biological experiments. While this works well when using a single ontology, integrating multiple ontologies can be problematic, as they are developed independently, which can lead to incompatibilities. The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry was created to address this by facilitating the development, harmonization, application and sharing of ontologies, guided by a set of overarching principles. One challenge in reaching these goals was that the OBO principles were not originally encoded in a precise fashion, and interpretation was subjective. Here, we show how we have addressed this by formally encoding the OBO principles as operational rules and implementing a suite of automated validation checks and a dashboard for objectively evaluating each ontology’s compliance with each principle. This entailed a substantial effort to curate metadata across all ontologies and to coordinate with individual stakeholders. We have applied these checks across the full OBO suite of ontologies, revealing areas where individual ontologies require changes to conform to our principles. Our work demonstrates how a sizable, federated community can be organized and evaluated on objective criteria that help improve overall quality and interoperability, which is vital for the sustenance of the OBO project and towards the overall goals of making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).

In this article, we propose 7 core measures of EHR use that reflect multiple dimensions of practice efficiency: total EHR time, work outside of work, time on documentation, time on prescriptions, inbox time, teamwork for orders, and an aspirational measure for the amount of undivided attention patients receive from their physicians during an encounter, undivided attention. We also illustrate sample use cases for these measures for multiple stakeholders. Finally, standardization of EHR log data measure specifications, as outlined here, will foster cross-study synthesis and comparative research."

To evaluate how, we measure ambulatory clinician EHR use in the United States throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods We use EHR meta-data from ambulatory care clinicians in 366 health systems using the Epic EHR system in the United States from December 2019 to December 2020. We used descriptive statistics for clinician EHR use including active-use time across clinical activities, time after-hours, and messages received. Multivariable regression to evaluate total and after-hours EHR work adjusting for daily volume and organizational characteristics, and to evaluate the association between messages and EHR time. Results Clinician time spent in the EHR per day dropped at the onset of the pandemic but had recovered to higher than prepandemic levels by July 2020. Time spent actively working in the EHR after-hours showed similar trends. These differences persisted in multivariable models. In-Basket messages received increased compared with prepandemic levels, with the largest increase coming from messages from patients, which increased to 157% of the prepandemic average. Each additional patient message was associated with a 2.32-min increase in EHR time per day (P &amp;lt; .001). Discussion Clinicians spent more total and after-hours time in the EHR in the latter half of 2020 compared with the prepandemic period. This was partially driven by increased time in Clinical Review and In-Basket messaging. Conclusions Reimbursement models and workflows for the post-COVID era should account for these demands on clinician time that occur outside the traditional visit."

How-ever, failures of medical AI could have serious consequences for both clinical outcomes and the patient experience. These consequences could erode public trust in AI, which could in turn undermine trust in our healthcare institutions. This article makes 2 contributions. First, it describes the major conceptual, technical, and humanistic challenges in medical AI. Second, it proposes a solution that hinges on the education and accreditation of new expert groups who specialize in the development, verification, and operation of medical AI technologies. These groups will be required to maintain trust in our healthcare institutions."
10.1287/isre.2019.0882,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Platform Pricing and Investment to Drive Third-Party Value Creation in Two-Sided Networks,"Many two-sided platforms, such as eBay, iOS, Android, and Twitter, invest in developer integration tools, such as modular interfaces, interactive development environments, application programming interfaces, and help desks, in order to reduce the cost and improve the functionality of third-party content developed for the platform. Although these integration tools are crucial to platform success, they are costly to create, and therefore, managers need to understand where and when to deploy them. In particular, when the necessary integration investment is high, the advice to subsidize one side of a two-sided market while charging the other may not hold. This means that integration investment should be carefully coordinated with market pricing decisions. In general, higher levels of investment by hardware/software platforms into integration become desirable when the platform (1) has access to a large pool of content providers and consumers, (2) is able to develop integration tools that are highly effective in reducing third-party development costs, and (3) operates in high-consumer value markets. However, there are nuances. For example, business to business platforms can make investments in integration to facilitate participation by both sides of the market. We find that such investments are complements, not—as one might expect—substitutes."
10.1093/jamia/ocaa094,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Latent bias and the implementation of artificial intelligence in medicine,"Abstract Increasing recognition of biases in artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms has motivated the quest to build fair models, free of biases. However, building fair models may be only half the challenge. A seemingly fair model could involve, directly or indirectly, what we call “latent biases.” Just as latent errors are generally described as errors “waiting to happen” in complex systems, latent biases are biases waiting to happen. Here we describe 3 major challenges related to bias in AI algorithms and propose several ways of managing them. There is an urgent need to address latent biases before the widespread implementation of AI algorithms in clinical practice."
10.1093/jcmc/zmac014,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,AI agency vs. human agency: understanding human-AI interactions on TikTok and their implications for user engagement,"AbstractArtificial intelligence (AI) technology has vastly reshaped user experiences on social media. AI-powered social media use and its outcomes largely depend on how users collaborate with AI that exercises agency. Through in-depth interviews with TikTok users, this study investigates how users collaborate with AI when using AI-powered social media and how such dynamics shape user engagement. We found that TikTok users are receptive to personalized experiences enabled by machine agency. However, by influencing each other, user agency and machine agency also led to user–AI synergy. Users deliberately influence content curation algorithms to make them cater more precisely to their needs; AI also facilitates users’ content creation and networking. Such AI–user collaboration on TikTok significantly influences medium engagement and social-interactive engagement. These findings advance our understanding of the dynamics between human agency and machine agency and, thus, how AI transforms user experiences on social media."
10.25300/MISQ/2021/16523,MIS QUARTERLY,STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS FOR AI: THE ROLE OF CIOS AND BOARDS OF DIRECTORS1,"This paper applies upper echelons theory to investigate whether chief information officers (CIOs) and boards of directors affect the development of AI orientation, which represents firms’ overall strategic direction and goals regarding the introduction and application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. We tested our model using a dataset drawn from 1,454 publicly listed firms in China. Our findings show that the presence of a CIO positively influences AI orientation and that board educational diversity, R&amp;D experience, and AI experience positively moderate the CIO’s effect on AI orientation. Our post hoc analysis further demonstrates that these board characteristics represent contingencies that impact AI orientation but not conventional IT orientation. This paper contributes to the upper echelons literature and IT management research by offering contextualized arguments that explain new business and IT strategies such as AI orientation. Further, our findings suggest important implications about how to build top management teams and boards capable of effectively developing AI orientations."
10.1111/isj.12333,INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL,Making the world a better place with fintech research,"AbstractFinancial technology (fintech) is seen as possessing significant potential to provide the poor access to financial services and help them escape the clutches of poverty. Surprisingly, Information Systems (IS) research has engaged little with fintech's promise of fostering financial inclusion for the poor. In the spirit of ‘making a better world with ICTs’, conducting ‘responsible IS research for a better world’ and ‘understanding and tackling societal grand challenges through management research’, we advance a framework for guiding IS research on fintech‐led financial inclusion. Drawing on the IS literature and Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) scholarship, we extrapolate five areas of research that can better illuminate fintech's contributions to financial inclusion: (a) business strategies for fintech‐led financial inclusion; (b) digital artifacts of fintech‐led financial inclusion; (c) business environment of fintech‐led financial inclusion; (d) microfoundations of fintech for financial inclusion; (e) developmental impacts of fintech. We conclude with a discussion of how the five areas offer opportunities for impactful research on fintech and the promise of building a financially inclusive society."
10.25300/MISQ/2021/16535,MIS QUARTERLY,FAILURES OF FAIRNESS IN AUTOMATION OF HUMAN-ML AUGMENTATION,"Machine learning (ML) tools reduce the costs of performing repetitive, time-consuming tasks yet run the risk of introducing systematic unfairness into organizational processes. Automated approaches to achieving fairness often fail in complex situations, leading some researchers to suggest that human augmentation of ML tools is necessary. However, our current understanding of human–ML augmentation remains limited. In this paper, we argue that the Information Systems (IS) discipline needs a more sophisticated view of and research into human–ML augmentation. We introduce a typology of augmentation for fairness consisting of four quadrants: reactive oversight, proactive oversight, informed reliance, and supervised reliance. We identify significant intersections with previous IS research and distinct managerial approaches to fairness for each quadrant. Several potential research questions emerge from fundamental differences between ML tools trained on data and traditional IS built with code. IS researchers may discover that the differences of ML tools undermine some of the fundamental assumptions upon which classic IS theories and concepts rest. ML may require massive rethinking of significant portions of the corpus of IS research in light of these differences, representing an exciting frontier for research into human–ML augmentation in the years ahead that IS researchers should embrace. 1"
10.1093/jcmc/zmaa014,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,The Impact of Internet and Social Media Use on Well-Being: A Longitudinal Analysis of Adolescents Across Nine Years,"Abstract The present research examines the longitudinal average impact of frequency of use of Internet and social networking sites (SNS) on subjective well-being of adolescents in Germany. Based on five-wave panel data that cover a period of nine years, we disentangle between-person and within-person effects of media use on depressive symptomatology and life satisfaction as indicators of subjective well-being. Additionally, we control for confounders such as TV use, self-esteem, and satisfaction with friends. We found that frequency of Internet use in general and use of SNS in particular is not substantially related subjective well-being. The explanatory power of general Internet use or SNS use to predict between-person differences or within-person change in subjective well-being is close to zero. TV use, a potentially confounding variable, is negatively related to satisfaction with life, but it does not affect depressive symptomatology. However, this effect is too small to be of practical relevance."
10.1093/jcmc/zmab010,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,Seeing Is Believing: Is Video Modality More Powerful in Spreading Fake News via Online Messaging Apps?,"Abstract False rumors on WhatsApp, the world’s largest messaging app, have led to mob lynching in India and other countries. Doctored videos sent over the platform have elicited visceral responses among users, resulting in the wrongful death of innocent people. Would the responses have been so strong if the false news were circulated in text or audio? Is video modality the reason for such powerful effects? We explored this question by comparing reactions to three false stories prepared in either text-only, audio-only, or video formats, among rural and urban users in India. Our findings reveal that video is processed more superficially, and therefore users believe in it more readily and share it with others. Aside from advancing our theoretical understanding of modality effects in the context of mobile media, our findings also hold practical implications for design of modality-based flagging of fake news, and literacy campaigns to inoculate users against misinformation."
10.1093/jamia/ocad259,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Improving large language models for clinical named entity recognition via prompt engineering,"Abstract Importance The study highlights the potential of large language models, specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in processing complex clinical data and extracting meaningful information with minimal training data. By developing and refining prompt-based strategies, we can significantly enhance the models’ performance, making them viable tools for clinical NER tasks and possibly reducing the reliance on extensive annotated datasets. Objectives This study quantifies the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for clinical named entity recognition (NER) tasks and proposes task-specific prompts to improve their performance. Materials and Methods We evaluated these models on 2 clinical NER tasks: (1) to extract medical problems, treatments, and tests from clinical notes in the MTSamples corpus, following the 2010 i2b2 concept extraction shared task, and (2) to identify nervous system disorder-related adverse events from safety reports in the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS). To improve the GPT models' performance, we developed a clinical task-specific prompt framework that includes (1) baseline prompts with task description and format specification, (2) annotation guideline-based prompts, (3) error analysis-based instructions, and (4) annotated samples for few-shot learning. We assessed each prompt's effectiveness and compared the models to BioClinicalBERT. Results Using baseline prompts, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved relaxed F1 scores of 0.634, 0.804 for MTSamples and 0.301, 0.593 for VAERS. Additional prompt components consistently improved model performance. When all 4 components were used, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved relaxed F1 socres of 0.794, 0.861 for MTSamples and 0.676, 0.736 for VAERS, demonstrating the effectiveness of our prompt framework. Although these results trail BioClinicalBERT (F1 of 0.901 for the MTSamples dataset and 0.802 for the VAERS), it is very promising considering few training samples are needed. Discussion The study’s findings suggest a promising direction in leveraging LLMs for clinical NER tasks. However, while the performance of GPT models improved with task-specific prompts, there's a need for further development and refinement. LLMs like GPT-4 show potential in achieving close performance to state-of-the-art models like BioClinicalBERT, but they still require careful prompt engineering and understanding of task-specific knowledge. The study also underscores the importance of evaluation schemas that accurately reflect the capabilities and performance of LLMs in clinical settings. Conclusion While direct application of GPT models to clinical NER tasks falls short of optimal performance, our task-specific prompt framework, incorporating medical knowledge and training samples, significantly enhances GPT models' feasibility for potential clinical applications."
10.1093/jamia/ocab199,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,The quality of social determinants data in the electronic health record: a systematic review,"AbstractObjectiveThe aim of this study was to collect and synthesize evidence regarding data quality problems encountered when working with variables related to social determinants of health (SDoH).Materials and MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of the literature on social determinants research and data quality and then iteratively identified themes in the literature using a content analysis process.ResultsThe most commonly represented quality issue associated with SDoH data is plausibility (n = 31, 41%). Factors related to race and ethnicity have the largest body of literature (n = 40, 53%). The first theme, noted in 62% (n = 47) of articles, is that bias or validity issues often result from data quality problems. The most frequently identified validity issue is misclassification bias (n = 23, 30%). The second theme is that many of the articles suggest methods for mitigating the issues resulting from poor social determinants data quality. We grouped these into 5 suggestions: avoid complete case analysis, impute data, rely on multiple sources, use validated software tools, and select addresses thoughtfully.DiscussionThe type of data quality problem varies depending on the variable, and each problem is associated with particular forms of analytical error. Problems encountered with the quality of SDoH data are rarely distributed randomly. Data from Hispanic patients are more prone to issues with plausibility and misclassification than data from other racial/ethnic groups.ConclusionConsideration of data quality and evidence-based quality improvement methods may help prevent bias and improve the validity of research conducted with SDoH data."
10.1093/reseval/rvab020,RESEARCH EVALUATION,Journal citation reports and the definition of a predatory journal: The case of the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) (Publication with Expression of Concern),"AbstractThe extent to which predatory journals can harm scientific practice increases as the numbers of such journals expand, in so far as they undermine scientific integrity, quality, and credibility, especially if those journals leak into prestigious databases. Clarivate's Journal Citation Reports (JCR), a reference for the assessment of researchers and for grant-making decisions, is used as a standard whitelist, in so far as the selectivity of a JCR-indexed journal adds a legitimacy of sorts to the articles that the journal publishes. The Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) had 53 journals ranked in the 2018 JCRs annual report. These journals are analysed, not only to contrast the formal criteria for the identification of predatory journals, but taking a step further, their background is also analysed with regard to self-citations and the source of those self-citations in 2018 and 2019. The results showed that the self-citation rates increased and was very much higher than those of the leading journals in the JCR category. Besides, an increasingly high rate of citations from other MDPI-journals was observed. The formal criteria together with the analysis of the citation patterns of the 53 journals under analysis all suggest they may be predatory journals. Hence, specific recommendations are given to researchers, educational institutions and prestigious databases advising them to review their working relations with those sorts of journals."
10.1287/isre.2022.1179,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Bots with Feelings: Should AI Agents Express Positive Emotion in Customer Service?,"The rise of emotional intelligence technology and the recent debate about the possibility of a “sentient” artificial intelligence (AI) urge the need to study the role of emotion during people’s interactions with AIs. In customer service, human employees are increasingly replaced by AI agents, such as chatbots, and often these AI agents are equipped with emotion-expressing capabilities to replicate the positive impact of human-expressed positive emotion. But is it indeed beneficial? This research explores how, when, and why an AI agent’s expression of positive emotion affects customers’ service evaluations. Through controlled experiments in which the subjects interacted with a service agent (AI or human) to resolve a hypothetical service issue, we provide answers to these questions. We show that AI-expressed positive emotion can influence customers affectively (by evoking customers’ positive emotions) and cognitively (by violating customers’ expectations) in opposite directions. Thus, positive emotion expressed by an AI agent (versus a human employee) is less effective in facilitating service evaluations. We further underscore that, depending on customers’ expectations toward their relationship with a service agent, AI-expressed positive emotion may enhance or hurt service evaluations. Overall, our work provides useful guidance on how and when companies can best deploy emotion-expressing AI agents."
10.1111/isj.12367,INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL,What influences the purchase of virtual gifts in live streaming in China? A cultural context-sensitive model,"AbstractChina is one of the largest and fastest‐growing markets for live streaming, and the purchase of virtual gifts in live streaming is the core for streamers and live streaming platforms in China to survive and thrive. Compared to western countries, live streaming in China highlights the lively social atmosphere and heated social interactions among streamers and viewers. This study develops a cultural context‐sensitive model that contextualises the purchase of virtual gifts in live streaming in China. Specifically, we focus on the viewer's social experience and the social atmosphere in live streaming which have received limited attention yet. We introduce viewers' social perceptions with regard to the streamer and other viewers (ie, perceived proximity to the streamer and sense of belonging to the viewer crowd) and show how such social perceptions contribute to the development of flow experience, which subsequently leads to purchase intention. This study also reveals how such social perceptions can be shaped by the contextual setting consisting of the IT‐related factors of live streaming (ie, responsiveness, two‐way communication, social presence, and self‐presentation) and the cultural characteristics of China (ie, social orientation and harmony). Our research offers both theoretical guidance for practitioners into cultivating viewers' purchase of virtual gifts in China's live streaming."
10.1287/isre.2020.0952,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Spillover Effect of Consumer Awareness on Third Parties' Selling Strategies and Retailers' Platform Openness,"Global e-commerce sales have experienced unprecedented growth for the past years and have reached over $2 trillion annually. One interesting phenomenon along with this remarkable growth is that giant online retailers, such as Amazon.com in the United States and JD.com in China, open their platforms and allow third-party sellers to offer products there, thus inviting competition. We explore why an online retailer would open its platform and why a third-party seller would join the platform. We highlight the role of a spillover effect that, when the third-party seller joins the retailer’s platform, more consumers become aware of the third-party seller’s existence and its products which are not even listed on the retailer’s platform. We characterize how the third-party seller’s optimal selling strategies should vary with and how the retailer’s openness decision should be determined by the extent of the spillover effect and the retailer’s initial awareness advantage. Compared with the case without a spillover effect, the spillover effect makes the retailer less likely to open its platform, but it makes the third-party seller more likely to sell identical products on an open retailer platform; the spillover effect always (weakly) benefits the third-party seller, but it does not necessarily hurt the retailer."
10.25300/MISQ/2021/1578,MIS QUARTERLY,AVOIDING AN OPPRESSIVE FUTURE OF MACHINE LEARNING: A DESIGN THEORY FOR EMANCIPATORY ASSISTANTS,"Widespread use of machine learning (ML) systems could result in an oppressive future of ubiquitous monitoring and behavior control that, for dialogic purposes, we call “Informania.” This dystopian future results from ML systems’ inherent design based on training data rather than built with code. To avoid this oppressive future, we develop the concept of an emancipatory assistant (EA), an ML system that engages with human users to help them understand and enact emancipatory outcomes amidst the oppressive environment of Informania. Using emancipatory pedagogy as a kernel theory, we develop two sets of design principles: one for the near future and the other for the far-term future. Designers optimize EA on emancipatory outcomes for an individual user, which protects the user from Informania’s oppression by engaging in an adversarial relationship with its oppressive ML platforms when necessary. The principles should encourage IS researchers to enlarge the range of possibilities for responding to the influx of ML systems. Given the fusion of social and technical expertise that IS research embodies, we encourage other IS researchers to theorize boldly about the long-term consequences of emerging technologies on society and potentially change their trajectory."
10.1287/isre.2019.0896,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Unemployment and Worker Participation in the Gig Economy: Evidence from an Online Labor Market,"The gig economy comprises a large portion of the workforce in today’s economy. The gig economy has low barriers to entry, enabling flexible work arrangements and allowing workers to engage in contingent employment, whenever, and in some cases, such as online labor markets, wherever, workers desire. And many of the workers seek and complete work via digital platforms. However, there is a lack of understanding into the participation in such platforms. The growth of the gig economy has been partly attributed to technological advancements that enable flexible work environments. In this study, we consider the role of an alternative driver, economic downturns, and associated financial stressors in the offline economy, for example, unemployment. Our analysis combines data from a leading online labor market and various archival sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We find local economic conditions significantly impact the intensive and extensive margins of labor supply in online labor markets. And such impacts are heterogeneous across different county characteristics. Given the prominence of the gig economy, we believe more research is needed to understand gig-economy participation. It is notable that policy makers recently started to look at related issues, proposing laws to protect the gig workers, such as the recent California Assembly Bill 5."
10.1093/jamia/ocae045,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,PMC-LLaMA: toward building open-source language models for medicine,"Abstract Objective Recently, large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding. While demonstrating proficiency in everyday conversations and question-answering (QA) situations, these models frequently struggle in domains that require precision, such as medical applications, due to their lack of domain-specific knowledge. In this article, we describe the procedure for building a powerful, open-source language model specifically designed for medicine applications, termed as PMC-LLaMA. Materials and methods We adapt a general-purpose LLM toward the medical domain, involving data-centric knowledge injection through the integration of 4.8M biomedical academic papers and 30K medical textbooks, as well as comprehensive domain-specific instruction fine-tuning, encompassing medical QA, rationale for reasoning, and conversational dialogues with 202M tokens. Results While evaluating various public medical QA benchmarks and manual rating, our lightweight PMC-LLaMA, which consists of only 13B parameters, exhibits superior performance, even surpassing ChatGPT. All models, codes, and datasets for instruction tuning will be released to the research community. Discussion Our contributions are 3-fold: (1) we build up an open-source LLM toward the medical domain. We believe the proposed PMC-LLaMA model can promote further development of foundation models in medicine, serving as a medical trainable basic generative language backbone; (2) we conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed component, demonstrating how different training data and model scales affect medical LLMs; (3) we contribute a large-scale, comprehensive dataset for instruction tuning. Conclusion In this article, we systematically investigate the process of building up an open-source medical-specific LLM, PMC-LLaMA."
10.1093/jamia/ocab009,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,Exploring the relationship between electronic health records and provider burnout: A systematic review,"Abstract Objective Stress and burnout due to electronic health record (EHR) technology has become a focus for burnout intervention. The aim of this study is to systematically review the relationship between EHR use and provider burnout. Materials and Methods A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, EMBASE, PsychInfo, ACM Digital Library in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. Inclusion criterion was original research investigating the association between EHR and provider burnout. Studies that did not measure the association objectively were excluded. Study quality was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument. Qualitative synthesis was also performed. Results Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria. The median sample size of providers was 810 (total 20 885; 44% male; mean age 53 [range, 34-56] years). Twenty-three (88%) studies were cross-sectional studies and 3 were single-arm cohort studies measuring pre- and postintervention burnout prevalence. Burnout was assessed objectively with various validated instruments. Insufficient time for documentation (odds ratio [OR], 1.40-5.83), high inbox or patient call message volumes (OR, 2.06-6.17), and negative perceptions of EHR by providers (OR, 2.17-2.44) were the 3 most cited EHR-related factors associated with higher rates of provider burnout that was assessed objectively. Conclusions The included studies were mostly observational studies; thus, we were not able to determine a causal relationship. Currently, there are few studies that objectively assessed the relationship between EHR use and provider burnout. The 3 most cited EHR factors associated with burnout were confirmed and should be the focus of efforts to improve EHR-related provider burnout."

Methods We systematically explored 4 widely used transformer-based architectures, including BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, and ELECTRA, for extracting various types of clinical concepts using 3 public datasets from the 2010 and 2012 i2b2 challenges and the 2018 n2c2 challenge. We examined general transformer models pretrained using general English corpora as well as clinical transformer models pretrained using a clinical corpus and compared them with a long short-term memory conditional random fields (LSTM-CRFs) mode as a baseline. Furthermore, we integrated the 4 clinical transformer-based models into an open-source package. Results and Conclusion The RoBERTa-MIMIC model achieved state-of-the-art performance on 3 public clinical concept extraction datasets with F1-scores of 0.8994, 0.8053, and 0.8907, respectively. Compared to the baseline LSTM-CRFs model, RoBERTa-MIMIC remarkably improved the F1-score by approximately 4% and 6% on the 2010 and 2012 i2b2 datasets. This study demonstrated the efficiency of transformer-based models for clinical concept extraction. Our methods and systems can be applied to other clinical tasks. The clinical transformer package with 4 pretrained clinical models is publicly available at https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/ClinicalTransformerNER. We believe this package will improve current practice on clinical concept extraction and other tasks in the medical domain."
10.1002/asi.24227,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,A user sensitive subject protection approach for book search service,"In a digital library, book search is one of the most important information services. However, with the rapid development of network technologies such as cloud computing, the server‐side of a digital library is becoming more and more untrusted; thus, how to prevent the disclosure of users' book query privacy is causing people's increasingly extensive concern. In this article, we propose to construct a group of plausible fake queries for each user book query to cover up the sensitive subjects behind users' queries. First, we propose a basic framework for the privacy protection in book search, which requires no change to the book search algorithm running on the server‐side, and no compromise to the accuracy of book search. Second, we present a privacy protection model for book search to formulate the constraints that ideal fake queries should satisfy, that is, (i) the feature similarity, which measures the confusion effect of fake queries on users' queries, and (ii) the privacy exposure, which measures the cover‐up effect of fake queries on users' sensitive subjects. Third, we discuss the algorithm implementation for the privacy model. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation."

Rapid telehealth expansion can be especially complex for pediatric patients. From the experience of a large academic medical center, this report describes a pathway for efficiently increasing capacity of remote pediatric enrollment for telehealth while fulfilling privacy, security, and convenience concerns. The design and implementation of the process took 2 days. Five process requirements were identified: efficient enrollment, remote ability to establish parentage, minimal additional work for application processing, compliance with guidelines for adolescent autonomy, and compliance with institutional privacy and security policies. Weekly enrollment subsequently increased 10-fold for children (age 0–12 years) and 1.2-fold for adolescents (age 13–17 years). Weekly telehealth visits increased 200-fold for children and 90-fold for adolescents. The obstacles and solutions presented in this report can provide guidance to health systems for similar challenges during the COVID-19 response and future disasters."

In this practitioner paper, we present an in‐depth DSI case study where the grassroots communities in a remote county leveraged e‐commerce to leapfrog out of poverty, becoming successful entrepreneurs with online businesses that thrive on a global scale. Based on this case study, we first discuss three leapfrogging opportunities afforded by e‐commerce, which were successfully embraced by the grassroots communities to begin the transformative journey. We then reveal three obstacles that emerged during the technology leapfrogging process, which have challenged the sustainability of the grassroots DSI endeavour. Lastly, we discuss three top‐down interventions that have been instrumental in overcoming the bottleneck of grassroots leapfrogging development and subsequently nurture a self‐sustaining, resilient community. Overall, by discussing some of the common barriers to the growth and sustainability of DSI, and how they have been addressed, this article offers insights and recommendations for policymakers, public and private sector practitioners, and communities in underdeveloped regions to navigate both the potentials and pitfalls of technology leapfrogging, and ultimately build a pathway towards resilience and sustainability."
10.1111/isj.12292,INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL,Understanding massively multiplayer online role-playing game addiction: A hedonic management perspective,"AbstractMassively multiplayer online role‐playing game (MMORPG) addiction presents a serious issue worldwide and has attracted increasing attention from academic and other public communities. This article addresses this critical issue and fills research gaps by proposing and testing a research model of MMORPG addiction. Building on the conceptual foundation of the hedonic management model of addiction and the technology affordance perspective, we develop a research model explaining how MMORPG affordances (ie, achievement, social and immersion affordances) are associated with the duality of hedonic effects (ie, perceived positive mood enhancement and perceived negative mood reduction) and the extent of MMORPG addiction. Using structural equation modelling, we empirically test our research model with 406 MMORPG players. The results show that both perceived positive mood enhancement and perceived negative mood reduction positively correlate with the extent of MMORPG addiction. Furthermore, achievement and immersion affordances are positively associated with the duality of hedonic effects, whereas social affordance is not. Our study contributes to the growing body of technology addiction literature by revealing the relationships between the two hedonic effects and the extent of MMORPG addiction, and by offering a contextualised explanation of the role of MMORPG affordances in these relationships. We offer an alternative perspective on the far‐reaching, unintended relationships between technological affordances and addictive technology use. Our study provides game developers and policymakers with insights into preventing MMORPG addiction to create an entertaining, healthy virtual playground."

Users bind the data variables to the different encoding channels, and specify the settings of each binding, from which the tool generates the interactive graphical display. Due to its efficiency of use, SCImago Graphica is not only suitable for visually communicating data, but also for exploratory data analysis. We evaluate the expressiveness and ease of use of SCImago Graphica through various examples of chart construction and a catalog of visualizations. The results show that SCImago Graphica makes it possible to create a wide variety of data visualizations quickly and easily."
10.1287/isre.2020.0949,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Financial Incentives Dampen Altruism in Online Prosocial Contributions: A Study of Online Reviews,"This paper uses a large Amazon review data set to examine the impact of financial incentives on prosocial contributions. The econometric analyses demonstrate a significant spillover effect, where product reviewers, after experiencing the receipt of financial incentives, tend to produce more positive but lower-quality unincentivized reviews subsequently. Theoretically, this paper advances our understanding of the interplay between financial incentives and prosocial behaviors through the lens of self-determination theory. Practically, this study provides insights into the design of online prosocial communities. Managers should not be enticed solely by an immediate increase in contribution quantity because the increased contribution volume might come at the cost of decreased quality in future unincentivized contributions. If platforms decide to provide financial incentives, they should target only altruistic contributors and limit the amount of incentives that an individual can receive. These findings provide important managerial implications for platforms hoping to motivate users’ prosocial contributions."
10.1002/asi.24359,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Detecting fake news stories via multimodal analysis,"AbstractFiltering, vetting, and verifying digital information is an area of core interest in information science. Online fake news is a specific type of digital misinformation that poses serious threats to democratic institutions, misguides the public, and can lead to radicalization and violence. Hence, fake news detection is an important problem for information science research. While there have been multiple attempts to identify fake news, most of such efforts have focused on a single modality (e.g., only text‐based or only visual features). However, news articles are increasingly framed as multimodal news stories, and hence, in this work, we propose a multimodal approach combining text and visual analysis of online news stories to automatically detect fake news. Drawing on key theories of information processing and presentation, we identify multiple text and visual features that are associated with fake or credible news articles. We then perform a predictive analysis to detect features most strongly associated with fake news. Next, we combine these features in predictive models using multiple machine‐learning techniques. The experimental results indicate that a multimodal approach outperforms single‐modality approaches, allowing for better fake news detection."
10.1287/isre.2019.0902,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Online Display Advertising Markets: A Literature Review and Future Directions,"Display advertising is a $50 billion industry in which advertisers’ (e.g., P&amp;G, Geico) demand for impressions is matched to publishers’ (e.g., Facebook, Wall Street Journal) supply of them. An ideal match is one wherein the publisher’s ad impression is assigned to the advertiser with the highest value for it. Intermediaries (e.g., Google) facilitate this match between advertisers and publishers by managing data and providing optimization tools and algorithms for serving ads. Although these markets exhibit high allocative efficiency, we argue there is considerable scope for improvement."
10.1287/serv.2020.0258,SERVICE SCIENCE,Frontiers in Service Science: Ride Matching for Peer-to-Peer Ride Sharing: A Review and Future Directions,"As a consequence of the sharing economy attaining more popularity, there has been a shift toward shared-use mobility services in recent years, especially those that encourage users to share their personal vehicles with others. To date, different variants of these services have been proposed that call for different settings and give rise to different research questions. Peer-to-peer (P2P) ride sharing is one such service that provides a platform for drivers to share their personal trips with riders who have similar itineraries. Unlike ride-sourcing services, drivers in P2P ride sharing have their own individual trips to make and are not driving for the sole purpose of serving rider requests. Unlike traditional carpooling, P2P ride sharing can serve on-demand and one-time trip requests. P2P ride sharing has been identified as a sustainable mode of transportation that results in several individual and societal benefits. The core of a P2P ride-sharing system is a ride-matching problem that determines ride-sharing plans for users. This paper reviews the major studies on the operations of P2P ride-sharing systems, with a focus on modeling and solution methodologies for matching, routing, and scheduling. In this paper, we classify ride-sharing systems based on their operational features and review the existing methodologies for each class. We further discuss a number of important directions for future research."
10.1287/isre.2019.0911,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Finding Useful Solutions in Online Knowledge Communities: A Theory-Driven Design and Multilevel Analysis,"In this study, we utilize a kernel theory of knowledge adoption model and propose a novel text analytic framework to classify the usefulness of solutions in online knowledge communities. The study combines multiple disciplines (behavioral, empirical, design science, and technical) to tackle an important and relevant business problem: how to effectively manage an online knowledge repository and identify useful solutions. Our framework can be implemented in online knowledge communities to improve users’ experience of searching for useful knowledge. The proposed framework has the potential to guide the development of customer-facing chatbots, which understand human-language questions and return helpful answers immediately."

10.1111/isj.12286,INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL,User idea implementation in open innovation communities: Evidence from a new product development crowdsourcing community,"AbstractIn collaborative crowdsourcing communities for open innovation, users generate and submit ideas as idea co‐creators. Firms then select and implement valuable ideas for new product development. Despite the popularity and success of these open innovation communities, relatively little is known about the factors that determine the implementation of the user‐generated ideas. Based on research on individual creativity, we propose a conceptual model integrating users' previous experience, idea presentation characteristics and feedback valence to explain the likelihood of idea implementation. We validate our research model with a panel data analysis of 43 550 ideas submitted by 16 360 users in the MIUI new product development community hosted by Xiaomi, a large electronics manufacturing company in China. We find an inverted U‐shaped relationship between users' past successful experience and idea implementation. Furthermore, the length of ideas is positively associated with the likelihood of idea implementation. There is also an inverted U‐shaped relationship between supporting evidence and idea implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the negative effect of positive feedback and the positive effect of negative feedback on idea implementation. These findings offer rich insights to understand the phenomenon of open innovation better. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
10.1093/database/baz155,DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION,PLANiTS: a curated sequence reference dataset for plant ITS DNA metabarcoding,"AbstractDNA metabarcoding combines DNA barcoding with high-throughput sequencing to identify different taxa within environmental communities. The ITS has already been proposed and widely used as universal barcode marker for plants, but a comprehensive, updated and accurate reference dataset of plant ITS sequences has not been available so far. Here, we constructed reference datasets of Viridiplantae ITS1, ITS2 and entire ITS sequences including both Chlorophyta and Streptophyta. The sequences were retrieved from NCBI, and the ITS region was extracted. The sequences underwent identity check to remove misidentified records and were clustered at 99% identity to reduce redundancy and computational effort. For this step, we developed a script called ‘better clustering for QIIME’ (bc4q) to ensure that the representative sequences are chosen according to the composition of the cluster at a different taxonomic level. The three datasets obtained with the bc4q script are PLANiTS1 (100 224 sequences), PLANiTS2 (96 771 sequences) and PLANiTS (97 550 sequences), and all are pre-formatted for QIIME, being this the most used bioinformatic pipeline for metabarcoding analysis. Being curated and updated reference databases, PLANiTS1, PLANiTS2 and PLANiTS are proposed as a reliable, pivotal first step for a general standardization of plant DNA metabarcoding studies. The bc4q script is presented as a new tool useful in each research dealing with sequences clustering.Database URL: https://github.com/apallavicini/bc4q; https://github.com/apallavicini/PLANiTS."
